Haste , nephew 1 what , a sluggard ?
Fie for shame !
Shall he that was our morning cock , turn owl, And lock out daylight from his drowsy eyes ?
Pray pardon me for once , lord uncle , for I 'll be sworn I had such a dream this morning : methought one came with a commission to take a sorrel curtoll that was stolen from him , wheresoever he could find him . And because I feared he would lay claim to my sorrel curtoll in my stable , I ran to the smith to have him set on his mane again and his tail presently , that the commissionman might not think him a curtoll . And when the smith would not do it , I fell a beating of him , so that I could not wake for my life till I was revenged on him .
This is your old valour , nephew , thatwill fight sleeping as well as waking .
Po . ' Slud , aunt ; what if my dream had been true ( as it might have been for any- thing I knew ) ; there 's never a smith in Italy shall make an ass of me in my sleep , if I.can choose .
Well said , my furious nephew ; but I see You quite forget that we must rouse to - day The sharp-tusk 'd boar ; and blaze ourhuntsmanship before the duke .
Forget , lord uncle ? I hope not ;
you think belike my wits are as brittle as abeetle , or as skittish as your Barbary mare ;
one cannot cry wehie , but straight shecries tihi .
Well guessed , cousin Hysteron Proteron .
But which way will the duke 's gracehunt to-day ?

At London Printed by V. S. for Thomas Thorppe . 1606 ."
Toward Count Lasso 's house his grace will hunt , Where he will visit his late honour 'd mistress .
Who , Lady Margaret , that dear young dame ?
Will his antiquity never leave his iniquity ?
Why , how now , nephew ? turn 'dParnassus lately ?
Nassus ? I know not ; but I would I had all the duke 's living for her sake ; I 'dmake him a poor duke , i'faith .
No doubt of that , if thou hadst allhis living .
I would not stand dreaming of thematter as I do now .
Why , how do you dream , nephew ?
Marry , all last night methought Iwas tying her shoe-string .
What , all night tying her shoe-string ?
Ay , that I was , and yet I tied it not neither ; for , as I was tying it , the string broke methought , and then methought , having but one point at my hose , me- thought I gave her that to tie her shoewithal .
A point of much kindness , I assureyou .
Whereupon , in the very nick me- thought , the Count came rushing in , and I ran rushing out , with my heels about myhose for haste .
So ! will you leave your dreaming ,and dispatch ?
Mum , not a word more , I 'll go before , and overtake you presently . \Exit .
My lord , I fancy not these hunting sports , When the bold game you follow turns again And stares you in the face . Let me behold A cast of falcons on their merry wings , I Daring the stooped prey , that shifting flies : i Or let me view the fearful hare or hind , I Toss 'd like a music point with harmony | Of well-mouth 'd hounds . This is a sport for princes , I The other rude boars yield fit game forI boors .
79 St . Thy timorous spirit blinds thy judgment , wife .
Those are most royal sports , that most approve The huntsman 's prowess , and his hardy mind .
My lord , I know too well your virtuous spirit ;
Take heed for God 's love , if you rouse the boar , You come not near him , but discharge aloof Your wounding pistol , or well-aimed dart .
Ay , marry , wife , this counsel rightly flows Out of thy bosom ; pray thee take less care , Let ladies at their tables judge of boars , Lords , in the field . And so farewell , sweet love ;
Fail not to meet me at Earl Lasso 's house .
Pray pardon me for that . You know I love notThese solemn meetings .
You must needs for once Constrain your disposition : and indeed I would acquaint you more with Lady MargaretFor special reason .
Very good , my lord .
Then I must needs go fit me for that presence .
Here comes my friend .
Good day , my lord ! Why does your grace confront So clear a morning with so cloudy looks ?
Ask 'st thou my griefs that know 'st my desperate love Curb 'd by my father 's stern rivality ?
Must not I mourn that know not whether yet I shall enjoy a stepdame or a wife ?
A wife , prince never doubt it ; your deserts And youthful graces have engaged so far , The beauteous Margaret , that she is your own .
Oh , but the eye of watchful jealousy Robs my desires of means t 'enjoy her favour .
Despair not : there are means enow for you : Suborn some servant of some good respect , That 's near your choice , who , though she needs no wooing , May yet imagine you are to begin Your strange young love-suit , and so speak for you , Bear your kind letters , and get safe access .
All which when he shall do , you need not fear His trusty secrecy , because he dares not Reveal escapes whereof himself is author , Whom you may best attempt , she must reveal ;
For , if she loves you , she already knows , And in an instant can resolve you that .
And so she will , I doubt not : would to heaven I had fit time , even now to know her mind : This counsel feeds my heart with much sweet hope .
Pursue it then ; 'twill not be hard t 'effect .
The duke has none for him , but Medice , That fustian lord , who in his buckram face , Bewrays , in my conceit , a map of baseness .
Ay , there 's a parcel of unconstrued stuff , That unknown minion raised to honour 's height , Without the help of Virtue , or of Art , Or ( to say true ) , of any honest part .
Oh , how he shames my father ! he goes like A prince 's footman , in old-fashion 'd silks , And most times , in his hose and doublet only , So miserable , that his own few menDo beg by virtue of his livery ;
For he gives none for any service done him , Or any honour , any least reward .
' Tis pity such should live about a prince : I would have such a noble counterfeit , nail 'd Upon the pillory , and after , whipt, For his adultery with nobility .
Faith , I would fain disgrace him by all means , As enemy to his base-bred ignorance , That being a great lord , cannot write nor read .
For that , we 'll follow the blind side of him , And make it sometimes subject of our mirth .
See , what news with your nephewPogio ?
None good , I warrant you .
Where should I find my Lord Uncle ?
What 's the huge haste with you ?
Oh , oh , you will hunt to-day !
I hope I will .
But you may hap to hop without your hope : for the truth is , Kilbuck is runmad .
What 's this ?
Nay , 'tis true , sir : and Kilbuck being run mad , bit Ringwood so by the left buttock , you might have turned your nosein it .
Out , ass !
By heaven , you might , my lord : d'yethink I lie ?
Zounds , might I ? Let 's blanket him ,my lord : a blanket here !
Nay , good my Lord Vincentio , by this rush I tell you for good will : and Venus your brache there , runs so proud , that your huntsman cannot take herdown for his life .
Take her up , fool , thou wouldst say .
Why , sir , he would soon take her down , and he could take her up , I warranther .
Well said , hammer , hammer .
Nay , good now , let 's alone , and there 's your horse , Gray Strozza , too has the staggers , and has strook bay-Bettrice , your Barbary mare so , that she goes haltinga this fashion , most filthily .
What poison blisters thy unhappy tongue Evermore braying forth unhappy news ?
Our hunting sport is at the best , my lord : How shall I satisfy the duke your father , Defrauding him of his expected sport ?
See , see , he comes .
Is this the copy of the speech you wrote , Signor Sarpego ?
It is a blaze of wit poetical .
Read it , brave duke , with eyes pathetical .
We will peruse it straight : well met , Vincentio , And good Lord Strozza , we commend you both For your attendance : but you must conceive , ' Tis no true hunting we intend to-day , But an inducement to a certain show , Wherewith we will present our beauteous love, And therein we bespeak your company .
We both are ready to attend your highness .
See then , here is a poem that : requires Your worthy censures ; offer 'd if it like To furnish our intended amorous show :Read it , Vincentio .
Pardon me my lord : Lord Medice 's reading will express it better .
My patience can digest your scoffs , my lord .
I care not to proclaim it to the world : I can nor write nor read ; and what of I that ?
I can both see and hear as well as vou .
Still are your wits at war ? here , read this poem .
" The red-faced sun hath firk 'd the flundering shades , And cast bright ammel on Aurora 's brow . "
High words and strange : read on , Vincentio .
' ' The busky groves that gag tooth 'd boars do shroud With cringle-crangle horns do ring aloud . "
My lord , my lord , I have a speech here worth ten of this , and yet I 'll mendit too .
A I. How likes Vincentio ?
It is strangely good , No inkhorn ever did bring forth the like .
Could these brave prancing words with , actions spur , Be ridden thoroughly , and managed right , Twould fright the audience , and perhaps delight .
Doubt you of action , sir ?
Ay , for such stuff .
Then know , my lord , I can both act and teach To any words ; when I in Padua school ' d it , I play 'd in one of Plautus " comedies , Namely , Curculio , where his part I acted , Projecting from the poor sum of four linesForty fair actions .
Let 's see that , I pray .
Your highness shall command .
But pardon me , if in my action 's heat , Entering in post post haste , I chance to take upSome of your honour 'd heels .
Y'ad best leave out that action for athing that I know , sir .
Then shall you see what I can dowithout it .
AL See , see ! he hath his furniture andall .
8r Sa . You must imagine , lords , I bring good news , Whereof being princely proud I scour the street , And over-tumble every man I meet .

Date viam mihi , Noti , atqut Ig- noti , Dum ego , hie , officium meumfacio .
Fugite omnes , abite , and de via secedite , ne quern in cursu capite , aut cubito , aut
AL Thanks , good Seigneur Sarpego .
How like you , lords , this stirring action ?
In a cold morning it were good , my lord , But something harsh upon repletion .
Sir , I have ventured , being en- join 'd , to eat Three scholars ' commons , and yet drew it neat .
Come , sir , you meddle in too many matters ; let us , I pray , tend on our ownshow at my Lord Lasso 's .
Doing obeisance then to every lord , I now consort you , sir , even toto corde .
{Exit Sarpego and Pogio .
My lord , away with these scholastic wits , Lay the invention of your speech on me , And the performance too ; I 'll play my part , That you shall say , Nature yields more than Art .
A I. Be 't so resolved ; unartificial truthAn unfeign 'd passion can decipher best .
But 'twill be hard , my lord , for one unlearn 'd .
Unlearn 'd ? I cry you mercy , sir ;
unlearn 'd ?
I mean , untaught , my lord , to make a speech , As a pretended actor , without clothes , More gracious than your doublet and your hose .
A I. What , think you , son , we mean t ' express a speech Of special weight without a like attire ?
Excuse me then , my lord ; so stands it well .
Has brought them rarely in , topageant him .
Curcul .i act . ii . sc . 3 .
What think you , lord , we think not of attire ?
Can we not make us ready at this age ?
Alas , my lord , your wit must pardon his .
I hope it will ; his wit is pitiful .
I pray stand by , my lord ; y 'are troublesome .
To none but you : am I to you , my lord ?
Not unto me .
Why , then , you wrong me , Strozza .
Nay , fall not out , my lords .
May I not knowWhat your speech is , my liege ?
AL None but myself , and the Lord Medice .
No, pray my lord , Let none partake with us .
No, be assured , But for another cause : a word , Lord Strozza ;
I tell you true , I fear Lord MediceWill scarce discharge the speech effectually ;
As we go , therefore , I 'll explain to you My whole intent , that you may second him If need and his debility require .
Thanks for this grace , my liege .

A I. Why , how now , son ? Forbear ;
yet 'tis no matter , We talk of other business , Medice, And come , we will prepare us to our show .

Stand by there , make place .
Say , now , Bassiolo , you on whom relies The general disposition of my house , In this , our preparation for the Duke , Are all our officers at large instructedFor fit discharge of their peculiar places ?
At large , my lord , instructed .
Are all our chambers hung ? Think you our house amply capacious to lodgeall the train ?
Amply capacious , I am passing glad .
Ai La . And now , then , to our mirth and musical show , Which , after supper , we intend t 'endure , Welcome 's chief dainties ; for choice cates at home ,
Are all parts perfect ?
One I know there is .
And that is yours .
Well guess 'd , in earnest , lord ;
I need not erubescere to takeSo much upon me : that my back will bear .
Nay , he will be perfection itself , For wording well , and dextrous action , too .
And will these waggish pages hit their songs ?
znd Page . Re , mi , fa , sol , la .
Oh , they are practising ; good boys , well done .
But where is Pogio ? There y 'are over- shot , To lay a capital part upon his brain , Whose absence tells me plainly he 'll neglect him .
Oh , no , my lord , he dreams of nothing else , And gives it out in wagers he 'll excell ;
And see ( I told your lordship ) he is come .
How now , my lord , have you borrowed a suit for me ? Seigneur Bassiolo , can all say , are all things ready ? The duke is hard by , and little thinks that I 'll be an actor , i'faith ; I keep all close , mylord .
Oh , 'tis well done , call all the ladies in ;
Sister and daughter , come , for God 's sake , come , Prepare your courtliest carriage for the duke .
And , niece , in any case remember this , Praise the old man , and when you see him first , Look me on none but him , smiling and lovingly ;
And then , when he comes near , make 'beisance low , With both your hands thus moving , which not only Is as 'twere courtly , and most comely too , But speaks ( as who should say ) ' ' Come hither , duke ; "
And yet says nothing , but you may deny .
Well taught , sister .
Ay , and to much end ;
I am exceeding fond to humour him .
Hark ! does he come with music ?
what , and bound ?
An amorous device : daughter , observe .
E nicr Enchanter , with spirits singing ;
after them , Medice like Sylvanus , next the Duke bound , Vincentio , Strozza ,with oilicrs .
Now let 's gull Medice ; I do not doubt But this attire put on , will put him out .
We 'll do our best to that end , therefore mark .
Lady or princess , both your choice commands , These spirits and I , all sen-ants of your beauty , Present this royal captive to your mercy .
Captive to me , a subject ?
Ay , fair nymph ;
And how the worthy mystery befell ,Sylvanus here , this wooden god , can tell .
A I. Now , my lord .
Now 'tis the time , man , speak .
Peace .
A I. Peace , Vincentio .
' Swounds , my lord !
Shall I stand by , and suffer him to shame you ?
My Lord Medice .
Will you speak , my lord ?
How can I ?
But you must speak in earnest ;
Would not your highness have him speak , my lord ?
Yes , and I will speak , and perhaps speak so As you shall never mend ; I can , I know .
Do then , my good lord .
A I. Medice , forth .
Goddess , fair goddess , for no less , no less .
A I. No less , no less ? no more , no more : speak you .
' Swounds ! they have put me out .
Laugh you , fair goddess, This nobleman disdains to be your fool .
A I. Vincentio , peace .
' Swounds , my lord ! it is as good a show ;
Pray speak , Lord Strozza .
Honourable dame .
Take heed you be not out , I pray , my lord .
I pray forbear , my Lord Vincentio .
At last , out of a myrtle grove he roused A vast and dreadful boar , so stern and fierce , As if the fiend fell Cruelty herself Had come to fright the woods in that strange shape .
A I. Excellent good !
Too good , a plague on him .
The princely savage being thus on foot , Tearing the earth up with his thundering hoof , And with the enraged ^Etna of his breath Firing the air , and scorching all the woods , Horror held all us huntsmen from pursuit , Only the duke , incensed with our cold fear , Incouraged like a second Hercules .
Zounds ! too good , man .
Pray thee let me alone ;
And like the English sign of great Saint George Vi . Plague of that simile .
Gave valorous example , and , like fire Hunted the monster close , and charged so fierce , That he inforced him ( as our sense con- ceived ) To leap for soil into a crystal spring ;
Where on the sudden strangely vanish ing , Nymphlike for him , out of the waves arose Your sacred figure like Diana arm 'd , And ( as in purpose of the beast 's revenge ) Discharged an arrow through his highness ' breast ;
Whence yet no wound or any blood appear 'd ;
With which the angry shadow left the light ;
And this enchanter , with his power of spirits , Brake from a cave , scattering enchanted sounds , That struck us senseless , while in these strange bands These cruel spirits thus inchain 'd his arms , And led him captive to your heavenly eyes , Th 'intent whereof on their report relies .
Bright nymph , that boar figured your cruelty , Chased by love , defended by your toeauty .
This amorous huntsman here we thus in- thrall 'd As the attendants on your grace 's charms , And brought him hither , by your boun- teous hands To be released , or live in endless bands .
Daughter , release the duke ; alas !
my liege , What meant your highness to endure this wrong ?
Enlarge him , niece ; come , dame , it must be so .
What , madam , shall I arrogate so much ?
His highness ' pleasure is to grace you so .
A I. Perform it then , sweet love , it is a deed Worthy the office of your honour 'd hand .
Too worthy , 1 confess , my lord , for me , If it were serious ; but it is in sport , And women are fit actors for such pageants .
A I. Thanks , gracious love ; why made you strange of this ?
I rest no less your captive than before ;
For me untying , you have tied me more .
Thanks , Strozza , for your speech ; no thanks to you .
No, thank your son , my lord .
' Twas very well , Exceeding well perform 'd on every part : .
How say you , Bassiolo ?
Rare , I protest , my lord .
Oh , my Lord Medice became it rarely , Methought I liked his manly being out ;
It becomes noblemen to do nothing well .
Now then , will 't please your grace to grace our house , And still vouchsafe our service further honour ?
A I. Lead us , my lord ; we will your daughter lead . {Exit .
You do not lead , but drag her leaden steps .
How did you like my speech ?
Oh , fie upon't , your rhetoric was too fine .
Nothing at all : I hope Saint George 's sign was gross enough .
But ( to be serious ) as these warnings pass , Watch you your father , I 'll watch Medice , That in your lovesuit we may shun suspect ;
To which end , with your next occasion , urge Your love to name the person she will choose , By whose means you may safely write or meet .
That 's our chief business ; and see ,here she comes .
G2
My lord , I only come to say , y 'are welcome , And so must say , farewell .
One word , I pray .
What 's that ?
You needs must presently devise , What person trusted chiefly with your guard , You think is aptest for me to corruptIn making him a mean for our safe meeting .
My father 's usher , none so fit , If you can work him well ; and so farewell , With thanks , my good Lord Strozza , foryour speech . {Exit .
I thank you for your patience , mocking lady .
Oh , what a fellow has she pick 'd us out !
One that I would have choosed past all the restFor his close stockings only .
And why not For the most constant fashion of his hat ?
Nay , then , if nothing must be left unspoke , For his strict form , thus still to wear his cloak .
Well , sir , he is your own , I make no doubt ;
For to these outward figures of his mind , He hath two inward swallowing properties Of any gudgeons : servile avarice And overweening thought of his own worth , Ready to snatch at every shade of glory ;
And , therefore , till you can directly board him , Waft him aloof with hats and other favoursStill as you meet him .
Come , lady , sit you here . Page , fill some sack , I am to work upon this aged dame , TV&gt ; glean fiom her if there be any cause tin loving others ) of her niece 's coynessXs&gt ; the most gracious love-suit of the duke .
Here , noble lady , this is healthful drinkAfter our supper .
Oh , 'tis that , my lord, That of all drinks keeps life and soul in me .
Here , fill it , Page , for this my worthy love .
Oh , how I could embrace this good old widow !
Now , lord , when you do thus you make me think Of my sweet husband , for he was as like you ;
E'en the same words and fashion ; the same eyes ;
Manly , and choleric e 'en as you are just, And e 'en as kind as you for all the world .
Oh , my sweet widow , thou dost make me proud !
Nay , I am too old for you .
Too old ! that 's nothing ;
Come , pledge me , wench , for I am dry again , And straight will charge your widowhood fresh , i 'faith : Why , that 's well done .
Now fie on't , here 's a draught .
Oh , it will warm your blood ; if you should sip , Twould make you heartburn 'd .
' Faith , and so they say ;
Yet I must tell you , since I plied this gear , I have been haunted with a whoreson pain here , And every moon almost with a shrewd fever , And yet I cannot leave it ; for , thank God , I never was more sound of wind and limb .
Look you , I warrant you I have a leg ,
Beshrew my life , But 'tis a leg indeed , a goodly limb .
This is most excellent !
Oh , that your nieceWere of as mild a spirit as yourself .
Alas , Lord Medice , would you have a girl , As well seen in behaviour as I ?
Ah , she 's a fond young thing , and grown so proud , The wind must blow at west still or she 'll be angry .
Mass , so methink ; how coy she 's to the duke , I lay my life she has some younger love .
' Faith , like enough .
Gods me , who should it be ?
If it be any ; Page , a little sack , If it be any ; hark now , if it be , I know not , by this sack ; but if it be , Mark what I say , my lord ; I drink t'ye first .
Well said , good widow ; much good do thy heart ,So , now what if it be ?
Well , if it be ;
To come to that , I said , for so I said , If it be any , 'tis the shrewd young prince ;
For eyes can speak , and eyes can under- stand , And I have mark 'd her eyes ; yet by this cup , Which I will only kiss .
Oh , noble crone , Now such a huddle and kettle never was .
I never yet have seen , not yet I say ;
But I will mark her after for your sake .
And do , I pray ; for it is passing like ;
And there is Strozza , a sly counsellor To the young boy . Oh , I would give a limb To have their knavery limn 'd and painted out .
They stand upon their wits and paperlearning ;
Give me a fellow with a natural wit That can make wit of no wit ; and wade through Great things with nothing , when their wits stick fast .
Oh , they be scurvy lords .
Faith , so they be , Your lordship still is of my mind in all , And e 'en so was my husband .
Gods my life , Strozza hath eavesdropp 'd here , and overheard us .
They have descried me ; what , Lord MediceCourting the lusty widow ?
Ay , and why not ?
Perhaps one does as much for you at home .
What , choleric man ? and toward wedlock too ?
And if he be , my lord , he may do worse .
If he be not , madam , he may dobetter .
My lords , and madam , the duke 's grace entreats you Into his presence .
T'attend his new-made duchess for this night , his p . WeBa . Come , strew this room "afresh ;
spread here this carpet , Nay , quickly man , I pray thee ; this way , fool , Lay me it smooth , and even ; look if he willl This way a little more ; a little there , Hast thou no forecast t 'slood , methinks a man Should not of mere necessity be an ass .
Look , how he strows here , too : come , Sir Giles Goosecap , I must do all myself ; lay me 'em thus , In fine , smooth threaves ; look you , sir , thus in threaves .
Perhaps some tender lady will squat here , And if some standing rush should chance to prick her , She 'd squeak , and spoil the songs that must be sung .
See , where he is ; now to him , and prepareYour familiarity .
Save you , master Basoiolo ;
I pray a word , sir ; but I fear I let you .
No, my good lord , no let .
I thank you , sir .
Nay , pray be cover 'd ; oh , I cry you mercy , You must be bare .
Ever to you , my lord .
Nay , not to me , sir , But to the fair right of your worshipfulplace .
A shame of both your worships .
What means your lordship ?
Only to do you right , sir , and myself ' ease , And what , sir , will there be some show tonight ?
A slender presentation of some music , And something else , my lord .
' Tis passing good , sir ;
I 'll not be overbold to ask the particulars .
Yes , if your lordship please .
Oh , no , good sir ;
But I did wonder much , for , as methought , I saw your hands at work .
Or else , my lord , Our business would be but badly done .
How virtuous is a worthy man 's example !
Who is this throne for , pray ?
For my lord 's daughter , 86
' Twill be exceeding fit ; and all this room Is passing well prepared ; a man would swear That all presentments in it would be rare .
Nay , see if thou canst lay 'em thus , in threaves .
In threaves , d'ye call it ?
Ay , my lord , in threaves .
A pretty term .
Well , sir , I thank you highly for this kindness , And pray you always make as bold with me For kindness more than this , if more may be .
Oh , my lord , this is nothing .
Sir , 'tis much ;
And now I 'll leave you , sir ; I know y 'are busy .
Faith , sir , a little .
I commend me t'ye , sir .
{Exit Vincentio .
A courteous prince , believe it ; I am sorry I was no bolder with him ; what a phrase He used at parting ! " I commend me t'ye . " I'll ha't , i'faith .
Good master usher , will you dictate to me Which is the part precedent of this night - cap , And which posterior ? I do ignorareHow I should wear it .
Why , sir , this , I take it , Is the precedent part ; ay , so it is .
And is all well , sir , think you ?
Passing well .
Why , sir , come on ; the usher shall be judge : See , master usher , this same Fungus here , Your lord 's retainer , whom I hope you rule , Would wear this better jerkin for the rush - man , When I do play the broom-man , and speak first .
Why , sir , I borrow 'd it , and I will wear it .
What , sir , in spite of your lord 's gentleman-usher ?
No spite , sir , but you have changed twice already , And now would ha't again .
Why , that 's all one , sir,Gentility must be fantastical .
I pray thee , Fungus , let master Pogio wear it .
And what shall I wear then ?
Why , here is one , that was a rush - man 's jerkin , and I pray , were 't not absurd then , a broom-man should wearit ?
Foh , there 's a reason ! I will keep it , . sir .
Will , sir ? then do your office , master Usher , Make him put off his jerkin ; you may pluck His coat over his ears , much more his jerkin .
Fungus , y 'ad best be ruled .
Best , sir ! I care not .
No, sir ? I hope you are my lord 's retainer .
I need not care a pudding for your lord : But spare not , keep it , for perhaps I 'll playMy part as well in this as you in that .
Well said , master Pogio ; my lordshall know it .
Look , master Usher , are these wags well dress 'd ?
I have been so in labour with 'em truly .
Y'ave had a very good deliverance , lady : How I did take her at her labour there : I use to gird these ladies so sometimes .
I pray , my lord , must not I wear thishair ?
I pray thee , ask my Usher ; come , despatch, The duke is ready ; are you ready there ?
See , master Usher , must he wear thishair ?
Bu . Pray , master Usher , where mustI come in ?
Am not I well for a Bug , masterUsher ?
What stir is with these boys here !
God forgive me , If 'twere not for the credit on't , I 'd seeYour apish trash afire , ere I 'd endure this .
You stand upon your tire ; but for your action Which you must use in singing of your songs Exceeding dextrously and full of life , I hope you 'll then stand like a sort of blocks , Without due motion of your hands and heads , And wresting your whole bodies to your words , Look to't , y 'are best ; and in ; go ; All go in : Po . Come in , my masters ; let 's be outanon . {Exeunf .
What , are all furnish 'd well ?
All well , my lord .
More lights then here , and let loud music sound .
Sound , Music . \Exuint .
Advance yourself , fair duchess , to this throne , As we have long since raised you to our heart ;
Better decorum never was beheld , Than 'twixt this state and you : and as all eyes Now fix 'd on your bright graces think it fit , So frame your favour to continue it .
My lord , but to obey your earnest will , And not make serious scruple of a toy , I scarce durst have presumed this minute 's height .
Usher , cause other music ; begin your show .
Sound Concert ; warn the Pedant to be ready .
Madam , I think you 'll see a pretty show .
I can expect no less in such a presence .
A I. Lo , what attention and state beauty breeds , Whose moving silence no shrill heraldneeds .
Lords of high degree , And ladies of low courtesy , I the pedant here , Whom some call schoolmaster , Because I can speak best ,Approach before the rest .
A very good reason .
But there are others coming , Without mask or mumming ;
For they are not ashamed , If need be , to be named , Nor will they hide their faces , In any place or places ;
For though they seem to come , Loaded with rush and broom , The broom-man , you must know , Is Seigneur Pogiq , Nephew , as shall appear , To my Lord Strozza here .
Oh , Lord ! I thank you , sir ; you grace me much .
And to this noble dame , Whom I with finger name .
A plague of that fool 's finger .
And women will ensue , Which I must tell you true , No women are indeed , But pages made for need To fill up women 's places , By virtue of their faces .
And other hidden graces .
A hall , a hall ! whist , still , be mum , For now with silver song they come .
Heroes and heroines of gallant strain , Let not these brooms motes in your eyes remain , For in the moon there 's one bears wither 'd bushes , But we ( dear wights ) do bear green brooms , green rushes , Whereof these verdant herbals cleeped broom , Do pierce and enter every lady 's room , And to prove them high-born and no base trash , Water , with which your physnomies you wash , Is but a broom . And more truth to de- liver , Grim Hercules swept a stable with a river .
The wind that sweeps foul " clouds out of the air , And for you ladies makes the welkin fair , Is but a broom : and oh , Dan Titan bright , Most clerkly call 'd the scavenger of night , What art thou , but a very broom of goldFor all this world not to be cried nor sold ?
Philosophy , that passion sweeps from thought ,
Now if philosophers but broom-men are ,Each broom-man then is a philosopher .
And so we come ( gracing your gracious graces ) To sweep care 's cobwebs from your cleanly faces .
A I. Thanks , good master broom-man .
For me rush-man then, To make rush ruffle in a verse of ten .
A rush which now your heels do lie on here Vi . Cry mercy , sir .
Was whilome used for a pungent spear , .
In that odd battle never fought but twice ( As Homer sings ) betwixt the frogs and mice .
Rushes make true-love knots ; rushes make rings , Your rush maugre the beard of winter springs .
And when with gentle , amorous , lazy limbs , Each lord with his fair , lady sweetly swims On these cool rushes ; they may with these babies , Cradles for children make , children for cradles , And lest some Momus here might now cry "push ! "
Saying our pageant is not worth a rush , Bundles of rushes , lo , we hung along , To pick his teeth that bites them with his tongue .
See , see , that 's Lord Medice .
Gods me , my lord , Has he pick 'd you out , picking of your teeth ?
What pick you out of that ?
Not such stale stuffAs you pick from your teeth .
A I. Leave this war with rushes , Good master pedant ; pray forth with your show .
Lo , thus far then ( brave duke ) you see , Mere ente 'rtainment . Now our glee Shall march forth in morality : ( And this quaint duchess here shall see I The fault of virgin nicety , ( First woo 'd with rural courtesy : Disburthen them , prance on this ground , And make your Exit with your Round .

I Now , as our country girls held off , And rudely did their lovers scoff ;
Our nymph , likewise , shall only glance By your fair eyes , and look askance Upon her female friend that wooes her , Who is in plain field forced to loose her .
And after them , to conclude all, The purlieu of our pastoral .
A female bug , and eke her friend , Shall only come and sing , and end .
BUG'S SONG.
This , lady and duchess , we conclude .
Fair virgins must not be too rude : For though the rural wild and anticAbused their loves as they were frantic ;
Yet take you in your ivory clutches , This noble duke , and be his duchess .
Thus thanking all for their tacete, I void the room , and cry valete . {Exit .
Generally well , and pleasingly performed .
Now I resign this borrow 'd majesty , Which sate unseemly on my worthless head , With humble service to your highness ' hands .
Well you became it , lady , and I know All here could wish it might be ever so .
Here 's one says Nay to that .
Plague on you , peace .
Now let it please your highness to accept A homely banquet , to close these rude sports .
A I. I thank your lordship much .
Bring lights , make place .
How d'ye , my lord ?
Oh , master broom-man , you did passing well .
Ah , you mad slave , you ! You are a tickling actor .
I was not out , like my Lord Medice .
How did you like me , aunt ?
Oh , rarely , rarely .
Oh , thou hast done a work of memory , And raised our house up higher by a story .
Friend , how conceit you my young mother here ?
Fitter for you , my lord , than for your father .
Medice after the song whispers alone withhis servant .
Thou art my trusty servant , and thou know 'st I have been ever bountiful lord to thee , As still I will be ; be thou thankful then , And do me now a service of import .
Any , my lord , in compass of my life .
To-morrow , then , the duke intends to hunt Where Strozza , my despiteful enemy , Will give attendance busy in the chase ;
Wherein ( as if by chance , when others shoot At the wild boar ) do thou discharge at him , And with an arrow cleave his canker 'd heart .
I will not fail , my lord .
Now Vanity and Policy enrich meWith some ridiculous fortune on this usher .
Where 's master Usher ?
Now I come , my lord .
Besides , good sir , your show didshow so well .
Did it , indeed , my lord ?
Oh , sir , believe k , Twas the best-fashion ' d and well-order 'd thing That ever eye beheld ; and therewithal , The fit attendance by the servants used , The gentle guise in serving every guest In other entertainments ; everything About your house so sortfully disposed , That even as in a turn-spit call 'd a jack , One vice assists another ; the great wheels Turning but softly , make the less to whirr About their business ; every different partConcurring to one commendable end ;
So , and in such conformance , with rare grace , Were all things order 'd in your good lord 'shouse .
The most fit simile that ever was .
But shall I tell you plainly my con- ceit , Touching the man that I think caused thisorder ?
Ay , good my lord .
You note my simile .
Drawn from the turn-spit .
I see you have me .
Even as in that quaint engine you have seen A little man in shreds , stand at the winder , And seems to put all things in act about him , Lifting and pulling with a mighty stir , Yet adds no force to it , nor nothing does : So ( though your lord be a brave gentle - man ) And seems to do this business , he does nothing ;
Some man about him was the festival robe That made him show so glorious and divine .
I cannot tell , my lord , yet I should knowIf any such there were .
" Should know , " quoth you ;
I warrant you , you know ; well , some there be Shall have the fortune to have such rare men ( Like brave beasts to their arms ) support their state , When others of as high a worth and breed Are made the wasteful food of them they feed .
What state hath your lord made you for your service ?
He has been my good lord , for I can spend Some fifteen hundred crowns in lands a year , Which I have gotten since I served him first .
No more than fifteen hundred crowns a year ?
It is so much as makes me live , my lord , Like a poor gentleman .
Nay , 'tis pretty well ;
But certainly my nature does esteem Nothing enough for virtue ; and had I The duke my father 's means , all should be spent , To keep brave men about me ; but , good sir , Accept this simple jewel at my hands , Till I can work persuasion of my friend - ship With worthier arguments .
No, good my lord , I can by no means merit the free bountiesYou have bestow 'd besides .
Nay , be not strange , But do yourself right , and be all one man In all your actions , do not think but some Have extraordinary spirits like yourself ,
' Tis a most kingly judgment in your lordship .
' Faith , sir , I know not , but 'tis my vain humour .
Oh , 'tis an honour in a nobleman .
Y'ave some lords now so politic and proud , They scorn to give good looks to worthy men .
Oh , fie upon 'em ! by that light , my lord , I am but servant to a nobleman , But if I would not scorn such puppet lords , Would I were breathless .
You sir ? So you may , For they will cog so when they wish to use men , With , " Pray be cover 'd , sir , " " I beseech you sit , " " Who 's there ? wait of master Usher to the door . "
Oh , these be godly gudgeons : where 's the deeds ?
The perfect nobleman ?
Oh , good my lord .
Away , away , ere I would flatter soI would eat rushes like Lord Medice .
Well , well , my lord , would there were more such princes .
Alas , 'twere pity , sir ; they would be gull 'd Out of their very skins .
Why , how are you , my lord ?
Who , I ? I care notIf I be gull 'd where I profess plain love ;
' Twill be their faults , you know .
Oh , 'twere their shames .
Well , take my jewel ; you shall not be strange , I love not many words .
My lord , I thank you ; I am of few words too .
Tis friendly said , You prove yourself a friend , and I would have you Advance your thoughts , and lay about for state Worthy your virtues ; be the minion Of some great king or duke ; there 's Medice , The minion of my father : Oh , the father !
What difference is there ? But I cannot flatter :A word to wise men .
I perceive your lordship .
Your lordship ? talk you now like a friend ?
Is this plain kindness ?
Is it not , my lord ?
A palpable flattering figure for men common : A my word I should think , if 'twere another , He meant to gull me .
Why , 'tis but your due .
' Tis but my due if you be still a stranger , But as I wish to choose you for my friend , As I intend when God shall call my father , To do I can tell what : but let that pass , Thus 'tis not fit ; let my friend be familiar , Use not me lordship , nor yet call me lord , Nor my whole name , Vincentio ; but Vince , As they call Jack or Will ; 'tis now in use ,'Twixt men of no equality or kindness .
I shall be quickly bold enough , my lord .
Nay , see how still you use that coy term , lord .
What argues this , but that you shun my friendship ?
Nay , pray say not so .
Who should not say so ?
Will you afford me now no name at all ?
What should I call you ?
Nay , then 'tis no matter , But I told you , Vince .
Why then , my sweet Vince .
Why so , then ; and yet still there is a fault In using these kind words , without kind deeds ;
Pray thee embrace me too .
Why then , sweet Vince .
Why , now I thank you ; 'sblood , shall friends be strange ?
Where there is plainness , there is ever truth : And I will still be plain , since I am true .
Come , let us lie a little ; I am weary .
And so am I , I swear , since yesterday .
You may , sir , by my faith ; and , sirrah , hark thee , What lordship wouldst thou wish to have , i'faith , When my old father dies ?
Oh , not you ! Well , sir , you shall have none , You are as coy a piece as your lord 's daughter .
Who , my mistress ?
Indeed , is she your mistress ?
Ffaith , sweet Vince , since she was three year old .
And are not we two friends ?
Who doubts of that ?
And are not two friends one ?
Even man and wife .
Then what to you she is , to me she should be .
Why , Vince , thou wouldst not have her ?
Oh , not I. I do not fancy anything like you .
Nay , but I pray thee tell me .
You do not mean to marry her yourself ?
Not I , by heaven !
Take heed now ; do not gull me .
No, by that candle .
Then will I be plain .
Think you she dotes not too much on my father ?
Oh yes , no doubt on't .
Nay , I pray you speak .
You silly man , you ; she cannot abide him .
Why , sweet friend , pardon me ;
alas ! I knew not .
But I do note you are in some things simple , And wrong yourself too much .
Thank you , good friend , For your plain dealing , I do mean , so well .
But who saw ever summer mix 'd with winter ?
There must be equal years where firm love is .
Could we two love so well so suddenly , Were we not something equaller in yearsThan he and she are ?
I cry ye mercy , sir , I know we could not , but yet be not too bitter , Considering love is fearful . And , sweet friend , I have a letter to entreat her kindness , Which , if you would convey Ba . Ay , if I would , sir ?
Why , 'faith , dear friend , I would not die requiteless .
Would you not so , sir ?
By heaven ! a little thing would make me box you , " Which if you would convey ? " why not , I pray " Which ( friend ) thou shalt convey ? "
Which friend , you shall then .
Well , friend , and I will then .
And use some kind persuasive words for me ?
The best , I swear , that my poor tongue can forge .
Ay , well said , poor tongue ; oh , 'tis rich in meekness ;
You are not known to speak well ? You have won Direction of the Earl and all his house , The favour of his daughter , and all dames That ever I saw come within your sight , With a poor tongue ? a plague a your sweet lips .
Well , we will do our best ; and 'faith , my Vince , She shall have an unwieldy and dull soul If she be nothing moved with my poor tongue,Call it no better , be it what it will .
Well said , i'faith ; now if I do not think ' Tis possible , besides her bare receipt Of that my letter , with thy friendly tongueTo get an answer of it , never trust me .
An answer , man ? 'Sblood , make no doubt of that .
By heaven , I think so ; now a plague of nature , That she gives all to some , and none to others .
How I endear him to me ! Come , Vince , rise , Next time I see her , I will give her this ;
Which when she sees she 'll think it won- drous strange Love should go by descent , and make the son Follow the father in his amorous steps .
She needs must think it strange , that ne 'er yet saw I durst speak to her , or had scarce her sight .
Well , Vince , I swear thou shalt both see and kiss her .
Swears my dear friend ? by what ?
Even by our friendship .
Oh , sacred oath ! which , how long will you keep ?
While there be bees in Hybla , or white sw^ans In bright Meander ; while the banks of Po Shall bear brave lilies ; or Italian damesBe called the Bonarobbas of the world .
' Tis elegantly said ; and when I fail
I^et no swans swim in bright Meander stream , Nor lilies spring upon the banks of Po , Nor let one fat Italian dame be found , But lean and brawn-fall 'n ; ay , and scarcely sound .
It is enough , but let 's embrace withal .
With all my heart .
So , now farewell , sweet Vince .

At your wish 'd service , sir .
Oh , fine friend , he had forgot the phrase :How serious apish souls are in vain form !
Well , he is mine , and he being trusted most With my dear love , may often work our meeting , And being thus engaged , dare not reveal .
Horse , horse , horse , my lord , horse !
your father is going a hunting .
My lord horse ? you ass , you ; d'yecall my lord , horse ?
Nay , he speaks riddles still ; let 's slithis tongue .
Nay , good uncle now , 'sblood , what captious ^ merchants you be ; so the duke took me 'up even now , my lord uncle here , and my old Lord Lasso : by heaven y 'are all too witty for me . T am the veriest fool onyou all , I 'll be sworn .
Therein thou art worth us all , forthou know 'st thyself .
But your wisdom was in a prettytaking last night ; was it not , I pray ?
Oh , for taking my drink a little ?
I'faith , my lord , for that you shall have the best sport presently , with Madam Corteza , that ever was ; 1 have made her so drunk , that she does nothing but kiss my Lord Medice . See , she comes riding the duke ; she 's passing well mounted ,believe it .
Good wench , forbear .
My lord , you must put forth your self among ladies . I warrant you have much in you , if you would show it ; see , a cheek a twenty ; " the body of a George , a good leg still ; still a good calf , and not flabby , nor hanging , I warrant you ; a brawn of a thumb here , and 'twere a pulled partridge . Niece Meg , thou shalt have the sweetest bedfellow on him that ever called lady husband ; try him , you shamefaced babie you , try him .
Good madam , be ruled .
What a nice thing it is , my lord :you must set forth this gear , and kiss her ;
i'faith you must ; get you together and benaughts awhile , get you together .
A I. Now , what a merry harmless dameit is !
My Lord Medice , you are a right noble man , and will do a woman right m a wrong matter and need be ; pray do you give the duke ensample upon me ; youcome a wooing to me now ; I accept it .
What mean you , sister ?
Pray my lord , away ; consider meas I am , a woman .
Lord , how I have wittolled her !
You come a wooing to me now ;
pray thee , duke , mark my Lord Medice ;
and do you mark me , virgin . Stand youaside , my lord , and all you , give place ;
now , my Lord Medice ; put case I be strange a little , yet you like a man put me to it . Come , kiss me , my lord ; be notashamed .
Not I , madam ; I come not awooing to you .
' Tis no matter , my lord , make as though you did , and come kiss me ! I wontbe strange a whit .
Fie , sister , y 'are to blame ; praywill you go to your chamber ?
Why , hark you brother .
What 's the matter ?
D'ye think I am drunk ?
I think so truly .
But are you sure I am drunk ?
Else I would not think so .
But , I would be glad to be sure on't .
I assure you then .
I hope your grace will pardon her , my liege , For 'tis most strange ; she 's as discreet a dame As any in these countries , and as sober , But for this only humour of the cup .
93 Al . Tis good , my lord , sometimes ;
Come , to our hunting ; now 'tis time , I think .
The very best time of the day , my lord .
AL Then , my lord , I will take my leave till night , Reserving thanks for all my entertainment Till I return ; in meantime , lovely dame , Remember the high state you last presented , And think it was not a mere festival show , But an essential type of that you are In full consent of all my faculties , And hark you , good my lord .

See now , they whisper Some private order ( I dare lay my life ) For a forced marriage 'twixt my love and father , I therefore must make sure ; and , noble friends , I 'll leave you all , when I have brought you forth And seen you in the chase ; meanwhile observe In all the time this solemn hunting lasts , My father , and his minion Medice , And note , if you can gather any sign , That they have miss 'd me , and suspect my being , If which fall out , send home my page before .
I will not fail , my lord .

Now , take thy time .
I warrant you , my lord , he shall not "scape me .
Now , my dear mistress , till our sports intended End with my absence , I will take my leave .
Bassiolo , attend you on my daughter .

Now will the sport begin ; I think my loveWill handle him as well as I have done .

Ma' Welcome , good madam ; maids , wait on my lady .
So , mistress , this is fit .
Fit , sir , why so ?
Why so ? I have most fortunate news for you .
For me , sir ? I beseech you , whatare they ?
Merit and fortune , for you both agree ;
Merit what you have , and have what you merit .
Lord ! with what rhetoric you prepare your news .
I need not ; for the plain contents they bear Utter 'd in any words , deserve their wel- come : And yet I hope the words will serve the turn .
What , in a letter ?
Why not ?
Whence is it ?
From one that will not shame it with his name, And that is Lord Vincentio .
King of heaven !
Is the man mad ?
Mad , madam , why ?
Oh , heaven ! I muse a man of your importance Will offer to bring me a letter thus .
Why , why , good mistress ; are you hurt in that ?
Your answer may be , what you will yourself .
Ay , but you should not do it : God 's my life !
You shall answer it .
Nay , you must answer it .
I answer it ! are you the man I trusted , And will betray me to a stranger thus ?
That 's nothing , dame ; all friends were strangers first .
Now , was there ever woman over- seen so In a wise man 's discretion ?
Your brain is shallow ; come , receive this letter .
How dare you say so , when you know so well How much I am engaged to the duke ?
The duke ? a proper match ; a grave old gentleman , Has beard at will ; and would , in my con- ' ceit , Make a most excellent pattern for a potter To have his picture stamp 'd on a stone To keep ale-knights in memory of sobriety .
Here , gentle madam , take it .
Take it , sir ?
Am I a common taker of love-letters ?
Common ? why , when received you one before ?
Come , 'tis no matter ; I had thought your care 94
On my direction ?
No, sir , not on yours .
Well , mistress , if you will take my advice At any time , then take this letter now .
' Tis strange ; I wonder the coy gen- tleman , That seeing me so oft would never speak, Is on the sudden so far wrapt to write .
It show 'd his judgment that he would not speak , Knowing with what a strict and jealous eye He should be noted ; hold , if you love yourself .
Now will you take this letter ? Pray be ruled .
Come , you have such another plaguy tongue, And yet , i'faith , I will not .
Lord of heaven !
What , did it burn your hands ? Hold , hold , I pray , And let the words within it fire your heart .
I wonder how the devil he found you out To be his spokesman . Oh , the duke would thank youIf he knew how you urged me for his son .
The duke ? I have fretted her , Even to the liver , and had much ado To make her take it ; but I knew 'twas sure , For he that cannot turn and wind a womanLike silk about his finger , is no man .
I 'll make her answer 't too .
Oh , here 's good stuff .
Hold , pray take it for your pains to bring it .
Lady , you err in my reward a little , Which must be a kind answer to this letter .
Nay then , i'faith , 'twere best you brought a priest , And then your client , and then keep the door .
Gods me , I never knew so rude a man .
Poor usher ! how wert thou wrought to this brake ?
Men work on one another for we women , Nay , each man on himself ; and all in oneSay , no man is content that lies alone .
Here comes our gulled squire .
Here , mistress , write .
What should I write ?
An answer to this letter .
Why , sir , I see no cause of answer in it , But if you needs will show how much you rule me , Sit down and answer it as you please yourself ;
Here is your paper , lay it fair afore you .
Lady , content ; I 'll be your secretary , Ma . I fit him in this task ; he thinks his pen The shaft of Cupid in an amorous letter .
Is here no great worth of your answer , say you ?
Believe it , 'tis exceedingly well writ .
So much the more unfit for me to answer , And therefore let your style and it contend .
Well , you shall see I will not be far short , Although indeed I cannot write so wellWhen one is by as when I am alone .
Oh , a good scribe must write though twenty talk , And he talk to them too .
Well , you shall see .
A proper piece of scribeship , there 's no doubt ;
Some words pick 'd out of proclamations , Or great men 's speeches , or wellsellingpamphlets .
See how he rubs his temples ; I believeHis Muse lies in the back part of his brain .
Which , thick and gross , is hard to be brought forward .
What , is it loth to come ?
No, not a whit :Pray hold your peace a little .
He sweats with bringing on his heavy style , I 'll ply him still till he sweat all his wit out : What man , not yet ?
' Swoons , you 'll not extort it from a man , How do you like the word endear 9Ma . O fie upon't !
Nay , then , I see your judgment : what say you to condole ?
Worse and worse .
Oh brave ! I should make a sweet answer , if I should use* no words but ofyour admittance .
Well , sir , write what you please .
Is model a good word with you ?
Put them together , I pray .
So I will , I warrant you .
See , see , see , now it comes pouring down .
I hope you 'll take no exceptions to believe it .
no belief at all in earnest shortly . Believe it 'tis a pretty feather ; believe it a daintyrush ; believe it an excellent cockscomb .
So , so , so ; your exceptions sortvery collaterally .
Collaterally ? there 's a fine wordnow ; wrest in that if you can by any means .
I thought she would like the very worst of them all ; how think you ? do notI write , and hear , and talk too now ?
By my soul , if you can tell whatyou write now , you write very readily .
That you shall see straight .
But do you not write that youspeak now ?
Ohyes ; do you not see how I write it ?
I cannot write when anybody is by me , I Ma . God 's my life ! stay , man ; you 'llmake it too long .
Nay , if I cannot tell what belongsto the length of a lady 's device , i'faith .
But I will not 'have it so long .
If I cannot fit you ?
Oh me ! how it comes upon him !
prithee be short .
Well , now I have done , and now I will read it : Your lordship 's motive accommodating my thoughts , with the very model of my heart 's mature consideration : it shall not be out of my element to negotiate with you in this amorous duello ; wherein I will condole with you , that our project cannot be so collaterally made as our endeared heartsmay very well seem to insinuate .
No more ; no more ; fie upon this !
Fie upon this ; he 's accursed that has to do with these unsound women , ofjudgment : if this be not good , i'faith !
But 'tis so good , 'twill not bethought to come from a woman 's brain .
That 's another matter .
Come , I will write myself .
A God 's name lady ; and yet I will not lose this I warrant you ; I know for what lady this will serve as fit . Now weshall have a sweet piece of inditement .
How spell you . foolish ?
Foolish ; she will presume t 'indite that cannot spell .
How spell you usher ?
'Sblood , you put not in those wordstogether , do you ?
No, not together .
What is betwixt , I pray ?
As the .
Ass the ? Betwixt foolish and usher ?
God 's my life , "foolish ass the usher ? "
Nay , then , you are so jealous of your wit ; now read all I have written , Ipray .
I am not so foolish as the usher would make me : Oh , ' ' so foolish as the usher would make me ? " Wherein wouldI make you foolish ?
Why , sir , in willing me to believe he loved me so well , being so mere atranger .
Oh , is't so ? you may say so , indeed .
Cry mercy , sir , and I will write so too , and yet my hand is so vile . Pray theesit thee down , and write as I bid thee .
With all my heart , lady ! Whatshall I write , now ?
You shall write this , sir , / am not so foolish to think you love me , being somere a stranger .
" So mere a stranger ! "
And yet I know love worksstrangely .
" Love works strangely . "
And therefore take heed , by whomyou speak for love .
" Speak for love . "
For he may speak for himself .
" May speak for himself . "
Not that I desire it .
" Desire it . "
But , if he do , you may speed , /confess .
" Speed , I confess . " Ma . But let that pass , I do not love to discourage anybody Ba . ' ' Discourage anybody " Ma . Do you , or he , pick out what youcan ; and so , farewell .
" And so , farewell . " Is this all ?
Ay , and he may thank your syren 'stongue that it is so much .
A proper letter , if you mark it .
Well , sir , though it be not so proper as the writer , yet 'tis as proper as the inditer . Every woman cannot be a gentleman usher ; they that cannot gobefore must come behind .
Well , lady , this I will cany in- stantly : I commend me t'ye , lady . \Exit + Ma . Pitiful usher , what a pretty sleightGoes to the working up of everything !
What sweet variety serves a woman 's wit , We make men sue to us for that we wish .
Poor men ; hold out awhile ; and do not sue,And , spite of custom , we will sue to you .

Oh , God ! how weary I am . Aunt , Madam Cynanche , aunt !
How now ?
Oh , God , aunt ! oh , God , aunt !
oh , God !
What bad news brings this man ?
Where is my lord ?
Oh , aunt , my uncle ! he 's shot !
Shot ? Ay me ! How is he shot ?
Why , with a forked shaft, As he was hunting , full in his left side .
Oh me , accursed ! Where is he ?
bring me where .
Coming with Doctor Benevemus ;
I 'll leave you , and go tell my Lord Vincentio .

See the sad sight ; I dare not yield to grief , But force feign 'd patience to recomfort him .
My lord , what chance is this ? How fares your lordship ?
Wounded , and faint with anguish :let me rest .
A chair .
Oh , doctor , is't a deadly hurt ?
I hope not , madam , though not freefrom danger .
Why pluck you not the arrow fromhis side ?
We cannot , lady ; the fork 'd head so fastSticks in the bottom of his solid rib .
No mean then , doctor , rests there toeduce it ?
This only , my good lord , to give your wound A greater orifice , and in sunder break The pierced rib , which being so near the midriff , And opening to the region of the heart , Will be exceeding dangerous to your life .
I will not see my bosom mangled so , Nor sternly be anatomized alive ;
I 'll rather perish with it sticking still .
Oh no ; sweet doctor , think upon some help .
I told you all that can be thought in art , Which since your lordship will not yield to use , Our last hope rests in nature 's secret aid , Whose power at length may happily expel it .
Must we attend at Death 's abhorred door The torturing delays of slavish nature ?
My life is in mine own powers to dissolve : And why not then the pains that plague my Rise , furies , and this fury of my bane Assail and conquer . What men madness call ( That hath no eye to sense , but frees the soul , Exempt of hope and fear , with instant fate ) Is manliest reason : manliest reason thenResolve and rid me of this brutish life ;
Hasten the cowardly protracted cure Of all diseases . King of physicians , Death , I'll dig thee from this mine of misery .
Oh ! hold , my lord ; this is no Christian part , Nor yet scarce manly , when your unkind foe , Imperious Death , shall make your groans his trumpets To summon resignation of life 's fort , To fly without resistance ; you must force A countermine of fortitude , more deep Than this poor mine of pains , to blow him up , And spite of him live victor , though subdued ;
Patience in torment is a valour more Than ever crown 'd th ' Alcmenean conqueror .
Rage is the vent of torment ; let me rise .
Men do but cry that rage in miseries , And scarcely beaten children become cries : Pains are like women 's clamours , which the less They find men 's patience stirr 'd , the more they cease .
Of this 'tis said , afflictions bring to God , Because they make us like him , drinking up Joys that deform us with the lusts of sense , And turn our general being into soul , Whose actions simply formed and applied ,Draw all our body 's frailties from respect .
Away with this unmed'cinable balm Of worded breath ; forbear , friends , let rne rest , I swear I will be bands unto myself .
97 Be . That will become your lordship best indeed .
I 'll break away , and leap into the sea , Or from some turret cast me headlong down To shiver this frail carcase into dust .
Oh , rny dear lord , what unlike word ?
are these To the late fruits of your religious noblesse ?
Leave me , fond woman .
I 'll be hewn from henceBefore I leave you ; help me , gentle doctor .
Have patience , good my lord .
Then lead me in , Cut off the timber of this cursed shaft, And let the fork 'd pile canker to my heart .
Dear lord , resolve on humble sufferance .
I will not hear thee , woman ; be content .
This is her letter , sir , you now shall see How silly a thing 'tis in respect of mine , And what a simple woman she has provedTo refuse mine for hers ; I pray look here .
Soft , sir , I know not , I being her sworn servant , If I may put up these disgraceful words , Given of my mistress , without touch ofhonour .
Disgraceful words ! I protest I speak notTo disgrace her , but to grace myself .
Nay then , sir , if it be to grace your- self , I am content ; but otherwise , you know , I was to take exceptions to a King .
Nay , y 'are i'th'right for that ; but read , I pray , if there be not more choice words in that letter than in any three ofGuevara 's Golden Epistles , I am a very ass .
How think you , Vince ?
Gods , what a beast am I !
It is no matter ; I can set it togetheragain .
Pardon me , sir , I protest I was ravished ; but was it possible she shouldprefer hers before this ?
Oh , sir , she cried " Fie upon this ! "
Well , I must say nothing ; love is blind , you know , and can find no fault inhis beloved .
Nay , that 's most certain .
Gi'e 't me ; I 'll have this letter .
No, good Vince ; 'tis not worth it .
I 'll ha't i'faith , here 's enough in it to serve for my letters as long as I live ; I 'll keep it to breed on as 'twere : But I much wonder you could make her write .
Indeed there were some words belong 'd to that .
How strong an influence works in well-placed words : And yet there must be a prepared love , To give those words so mighty a command , Or 'twere impossible they should move so much : And will you tell me true ?
In anything .
Does not this lady love you ?
Love me ? why , yes : I think she does not hate me .
Nay , but . i'faith , does she not love you dearly ?
No, I protest .
Nor have you never kissed her ?
Kissed her ? that 's nothing .
But you know my meaning ;
Have you not been , as one would say , afore me ?
Not I , I swear .
Oh , y 'are too true to tell .
Nay , by my troth , she has , I must confess , Used me with good respect , and nobly still ;
But for such matters Vi . Very little more Would make him take her maidenhead upon him ;
Well , friend , I rest yet in a little doubt , This was not hers .
Twas , by that light that shines , And I 'll go fetch her to you to confirm it .
A passing friend .
But when she comes , in any case be bold , And come upon her with some pleasing thing , To show y 'are pleased ; however she be- haves her , As for example : if she turn her back , Use you that action you would do before , And court her thus : 1 ' Lady , your back part is as fair to meAs is your fore-part . "
' Twill be most pleasing .
Ay , for if you love
As a man should .
True , will you think of this ?
I hope I shall .
But if she chance to laugh , You must not lose your countenance , but devise Some speech to show you pleased , even being laugh 'd at .
Ay , but what speech ?
Inspire him , Folly .
Or 'tis no matter , be but bold enough , And laugh when she laughs , and it is enough ;
Now was there ever such a demilance ;
To bear a man so clear through thick andthin ?
Or hark you , sir , if she should steal a laughter Under her fan , thus you may say : " Sweet lady , If you will laugh and lie down , I am pleased . "
And so I were , by heaven ; how know you that ?
' Slid man , I 'll hit your very thoughts in these things .
Fetch her , sweet friend ; I 'll hit your words , I warrant .
Be bold then , Vince , and press her to it hard , A shame-faced man is of all women barr 'd .

How easily worthless men take worth upon them , And being over-credulous of their own worths , Do underprize as much the worth of others .
The fool is rich , and absurd riches thinks All merit is rung out , where his pursechinks .
My lord , with much entreaty here 'smy lady .
Nay , madam , look not back ; why , Vince , I say !
Vince ! Oh , monstrous jest !
To her , for shame .
Lady , your back part is as sweet to meAs all your fore-part .
He missed a little : he said her back part was sweet , when he should have said fair ; but see , she laughs most fitly tobring in the t 'other . Vince , to her again ;
she laughs .
Laugh you , fair dame ?
If you will laugh and lie down , I am pleased .
What vilianous stuff is here ?
Sweet mistress , of mere grace ini- bolden now The kind young prince here ; it is only love Upon my protestation that thus daunts His most heroic spirit : so awhile I 'll leave you close together ; Vince , I say {Exit .
Oh , horrible hearing ! does he call you Vince ?
Oh , ay , what else ? and I made him embrace me , Knitting a most familiar league of friendship .
But wherefore did you court me so absurdly ?
God 's me , he taught me ; I spake out of him .
Oh , fie upon't , could you for pity make him Such a poor creature ? 'twas abuse enough To make him take on him such saucy friendship ;
And yet his place is great ; for he 's not only My father 's Usher , but the world 's beside , Because he goes before it all in folly .
Well , in these homely wiles must our loves mask , Since power denies him his apparent right .
But is there no mean to dissolve that power , And to prevent all further wrong to us Which it may work , by forcing marriage ritesBetwixt me and the duke ?
No mean but one , And that is closely to be married first , Which I perceive not how we can perform ;
For at my father 's coming back from hunting , I fear your father and himself resolve To bar my interest with his present nuptials .
n Ma . That shall they never do ; may not we now Our contract make , and marry before heaven ?
Are not the laws of God and Nature more Than formal laws of men ? are outward rites More virtuous than the very substance isOf holy nuptials solemnized within ?
Or shall laws made to curb the common world , That would not be contain 'd in form with - out them , Hurt them that are a law unto themselves ?
My princely love , 'tis not a priest shall let us ;
But since th* eternal acts of our pure souls Knit us with God , the soul of all the world , He shall be priest to us ; and with such rites As we can here devise , we will express And strongly ratify our hearts ' true vows , Which no external violence shall dissolve .
This is our only mean t 'enjoy each other : And , my dear life , I will devise a form To execute the substance of our minds In honour 'd nuptials . First , then , hide your face With this your spotless white and virgin veil : Now this my scarf I 'll knit about your arm , As you shall knit this other end on mine ;
And as I knit it , here I vow by Heaven , By the most sweet imaginary joys Of untried nuptials ; by love 's ushering fire , Fore-melting beauty , and love 's flame itself , As this is soft and pliant to your arm In a circumferent flexure , so will I Be tender of your welfare and your will , As of mine own , as of my life and soul , In all things , and for ever ; only you Shall have this care in fulness , only you Of all dames shall be mine , and only you I 'll court , commend and joy in , till I die .
With like conceit on your arm this I tie , And here in sight of heaven , by it I swear By my love to you , which commands my life , By the dear price of such a constant hus- band As you have vow 'd to be : and by the joy I shall embrace by all means to requite you : I 'll be as apt to govern as this silk , As private as my face is to this veil , And as far from offence , as this from blackness .
I will be courted of no man but you ;
In and for you , shall be my joys and woes If you be sick , I will be sick , though well If you be well , I will be well , though sick Yourself alone my complete world shall be, Even from this hour , to all eternity .
It is enough , and binds as much as marriage .
I 'll see in what plight my poor lover stands , God 's me ! a beckons me to have me gone ;
It seems he 's enter 'd into some good vein ;
I 'll hence , love cureth when he vents his pain . \Exit .
Now , my sweet life , we both re - member well What we have vow 'd shall all be kept entire Maugre our fathers ' wraths , danger and death ;
And to confirm this shall we spend our breath ?
Be well advised , for yet your choice shall be In all things as before , as large and free .
What I have vow 'd I 'll keep , even past my death .
And I : and now in token I dissolve Your virgin state , I take this snowy veil From your much fairer face , and claim the dues Of sacred nuptials ; and now , fairest heaven , As thou art infinitely raised from earth , Different and opposite , so bless this match , As far removed from custom 's popular sects , And as unstain 'd with her abhorr 'd respects .
Mistress , away ! Pogio runs up and down , Calling for Lord Vincentio ; come away , For hitherward he bends his clamorous haste .
Remember , love .
{Exit Mar . and Bassiolo .
Or else , forget me heaven .
Why am I sought for by this Pogio ?
The ass is great with child of some ill news ;
His mouth is never fill 'd with other sound .
Where is my Lord Vincentio ; whereis my lord ?
H2 100
' Slood , my lord ! I have followed you up and down like a Tantalus pig , till I have worn out my hose hereabouts , I'llbe sworn , and yet you call me ass still .
But I can tell you passing ill news , mylord .
I know that well , sir , thou never bring 'st other ; what 's your news now , Ipray ?
Oh , lord , my lord uncle is shot inthe side with an arrow .
Plagues take thy tongue ! is he inany danger ?
Oh , danger ; ay , he has lien speechless this two hours , and talks so idly .
Accursed news ! where is he ? bringme to him .
How fares it now with my dear lord and husband ?
Come near me , wife ; I fare the better far For the sweet food of thy divine advice .
Let no man value at a little price A virtuous woman 's counsel , her wing 'd spirit Is feather 'd oftentimes with heavenly words ;
And , like her beauty , ravishing , and pure ;
The weaker body , still the stronger soul : When good endeavours do her powers apply , Her love draws nearest man 's felicity .
Oh , what a treasure is a virtuous wife , Discreet and loving ; not one gift on earth Makes a man 's life so highly bound to heaven ;
She gives him double forces to endure , And to enjoy ; by being one with him , Feeling his joys and griefs with equal sense ;
And like the twins Hippocrates reports , If he fetch sighs , she draws her breath as short , If he lament , she melts herself in tears ;
If he be glad , she triumphs ; if he stir , She moves his way ; in all things his sweet ape : And is in alterations passing strange , Himself divinely varied without change .
Gold is right precious , but his price in- fects With pride and avarice ; authority lifts Hats from men 's heads , and bows the strongest knees , Yet cannot bend in rule the weakest hearts ;
Music delights but one sense , nor choice meats ;
One quickly fades , the other stir to sin ;
But a true wife both sense and soul delights , And mixeth not her good with any ill ;
Her virtues ( ruling hearts ) all powers command ;
All store without her leaves a man but poor ;
And with her poverty is exceeding store ;
No time is tedious with her , her true worth Makes a true husband think , his arms enfold ;
With her alone , a complete world of gold .
I wish , dear love , I could deserve as much As your most kind conceit hath well express 'd ;
But when my best is done , I see you wounded , And neither can recure nor ease your pains .
Cynanche , thy advice hath made me well ;
My free submission to the hand of heavenMakes it redeem me from the rage of pain .
For though I know the malice of my wound Shoots still the same distemper through my veins , Yet the judicial patience I embrace ( In which my mind spreads her impassive powers Through all my suffering parts ) expels their frailty ;
And rendering up their whole life to my soul , Leaves me nought else but soul ; and so like her , Free from the passions of my fuming blood .
Would God you were so ; and that too much pain Were not the reason you felt sense of none .
Think 'st thou me mad , Cynanche ?
for mad men , By pains ungover n 'd , have no sense of pain .
But I , I tell you , am quite contrary , Eased with well governing my submitted pain ;
Be cheer 'd then , wife , and look not for in me The manners of a common wounded man .
Humility hath raised me to the stars ;
I sit and see things hid from human sight .
Ay , even the very accidents to come Are present with my knowledge ; the seventh day The arrow-head will fall out of my side .
The seventh day , wife , the forked head will out .
Would God it would , my lord , and leave you well .
Yes , the seventh day , I am assured it will ;
And I shall live , I know it ; I thank heaven I know it well ; and I 'll teach my phy- sician To build his cares hereafter upon heaven More than on earthly medicines ; for I know Many things shown me from the open 'd skies That pass all arts . Now my physicianIs coming to me ; he makes friendly haste ;
And I will well requite his care of me .
How know you he is coming ?
Passing well ;
And that my dear friend , Lord Vincentio , Will presently come see me too ; I 'll stay My good physician , till my true friend come .
Ay me , his talk is idle ; and I fear Foretells his reasonable soul now leaves him .
Bring my physician in ; he 's at the door .
Alas ! there 's no physician .
But I know it ;
See , he is come .
How fares my worthy lord ?
Good doctor , I endure no pain at all , And the seventh day the arrow 's head will out .
Why should it fall out the seventh day , my lord ?
I know it ; the seventh day it will not fail .
I wish it may , my lord .
Yes , 'twill be so , You come with purpose to take present leave , But you shall stay awhile ; my Lord Vin- centio Would see you fain , and now is coming hither .
How knows your lordship ? haveyou sent for him ?
No, but 'tis very true ; he 's now hard by , And will not hinder your affairs a whit .
How want of rest distempers his light brain !
Brings my lord any train ?
None but himself .
My nephew Pogio now hath left his grace .
Good doctor go , and bring him by his hand , Which he will give you , to my longing eyes .
The prince , I think , Yet knows not of your hurt .
Yes , wife , too well : See , he is come ; welcome , my princely friend ;
I have been shot , my lord ; but the seventh day The arrow 's head will fall out of my side, And I shall live .
I do not fear your life ;
But , doctor , is it your opinion That the seventh day the arrow-head will out ?
No, 'tis not his opinion , 'tis my knowledge ;
For I do know it well ; and I do wish , Even for your only sake , my noble lord , This were the seventh day ; and I now were well , That I might be some strength to your hard state , For you have many perils to endure : Great is your danger , great , your unjust ill Is passing foul and mortal ; would to God My wound were something well , I might be with you .
Nay , do not whisper ; I know what I say , Too well for you , my lord ; I wonder heaven Will let such violence threat an innocent life .
Whate 'er it be , dear friend , so you be well , I will endure it all ; your wounded stateIs all the danger I fear towards me .
Nay , mine is nothing ; for the seventh day This arrow-head will out , and I shall live , And so shall you , I think ; but very hardly .
It will be hardly you will 'scape indeed .
Be as will be , pray heaven your prophecy
What says my doctor ? thinks he I say true ?
If your good lordship could but rest awhile , I would hope well .
Yes , I shall rest , I know , If that will help your judgment .
Yes , it will , And good my lord , let 's help you in to try .
Why should the humorous boy forsake the chase ;
As if he took advantage of my absence To some act that my presence would offend ?
I warrant you , my lord , 'tis to that end ;
And I believe he wrongs you in your love .
Children presuming on their parents ' kind - Care not what unkind actions they commit Against their quiet : And were I as you , I would affright my son from these bold parts , And father him as I found his deserts .
I swear I will : and can I prove he aims At any interruption in my love , I'll interrupt his life .
We soon shall see , For I have made Madame Corteza search , With pick-locks , all the ladies ' cabinets About Earl Lasso 's house ; and if there be Traffic of love , 'twixt any one of them And your suspected son , 'twill soon appear, In some sign of their amorous merchandize ;
See where she comes , loaded with gems and papers .
See here , my lord , I have robb 'd all their caskets .
Know you this ring ? this carcanet ? this chain ?
Will any of these letters serve your turn ?
I know not these things ; but come , let me readSome of these letters .
Madam , in this deedYou deserve highly of my lord the duke .
Nay , my Lord Medice , I think I told you I could do pretty well in these affairs : Oh , these young girls engross up all the love From us poor beldams ; but I hold my hand , I 'll ferret all the coney-holes of their kind nessEre I have done with them .
Passion of death !
See , see , Lord Medice , my traitorous sonHath long joy 'd in the favours of my love ;
Woe to the womb that bore him , and my care To bring him up to this accursed hour , In which all cares possess my wretched life .
What father would believe he had a son So full of treachery to his innocent state ?
And yet , my lord , this letter shows no meeting , But a desire to meet .
Yes , yes , my lord , I do suspect they meet ; and I believeI know well where too : I believe I do ;
And therefore tell me , does no creature know That you have left the chase thus suddenly , And are come hither ? have you not been seen By any of these lovers ?
Not by any .
Come then , come follow me : I am persuaded I shall go near to show you their kind hands , Their confidence , that you are still a - hunting , Will make your amorous son that stole from thence Bold in his love-sports ; come , come , a fresh chase ;
I hold this pick-lock ; you shall hunt at view .
What , do they think to 'scape ? An old wife 's eye Is a blue crystal full of sorcery .
Tell me , I pray you , what strange hopes they are That feed your coy conceits against the duke , And are preferr 'd before the assured great- ness His highness graciously would make your fortunes ?
I have small hopes , my lord ; but a desire To make my nuptial choice of one I love ;
103 And as I would be loth t ' impair my state , So I affect not honours that exceed it .
Oh , you are very temperate in your choice , Pleading a judgment past your sex and years .
But I believe some fancy will be found The forge of these gay glosses : if it be , I shall decipher what close traitor 'tisThat is your agent in your secret plots .
' Swoons !
And him for whom you plot ; and on you all I will revenge thy disobedience With such severe correction as shall fright All such deluders from the like attempts : But chiefly he shall smart that is your factor .
Oh me , accursed !
Meantime I 'll cutYour poor craft short , i'faith .
Poor craft , indeed , That I or any others use for me .
Well , dame , if it be nothing but the jar Of your unfitted fancy that procures Your wilful coyness to my lord the duke , No doubt but Time and Judgment will conform it To such obedience as so great desertProposed to your acceptance doth require .
To which end do you counsel her , Bassiolo .
And let me see , maid , 'gainst the duke 's re - turn , Another tincture set upon your looks Than heretofore . For , be assured , at lastThou shalt consent , or else incur my curse .
Ay , my good lord : God 's pity , what an errant ass was ITo entertain the prince 's crafty friendship !
'Sblood , I half suspect the villain gull 'd me .
Our squire , I think , is startled .
Nay , lady , it is true , And you must frame your fancy to the duke ;
For I protest I will not be corrupted , For all the friends and fortunes in the world , To gull my lord that trusts me .
Oh , sir , now Y'are true too late .
No, lady , not a whit ;
'Sblood , and you think to make an ass of me , May chance to rise betimes ; I know't , I know .
Out , servile coward , shall a light suspect That hath no slenderest proof of what we do , Infringe the weighty faith that thou hast sworn To thy dear friend , the prince , that dotes on thee , And will in pieces cut thee for thy falsehood ?
I care not . I 'll not hazard my estate For any prince on earth : and I 'll disclose The complot to your father , if you yield not To his obedience .
Do , if thou darest , Even for thy scraped-up living , and thy life , I 'll tell my father then how thou didst woo me To love the young prince ; and didst force me too To take his letters : I was well inclined , I will be sworn , before , to love the duke ;
But thy vile railing at him made me hate him .
I rail at him ?
Ay , marry , did you sir , And said he was " a pattern for a potter , To have his picture stamp 'd on a stone jug , To keep ale-knights in memory of so -
Sh'as a plaguy memory .
I could have loved him else ; nay , I did love him , Though I dissembled it , to bring him on , And I by this time might have been a Duchess ;
And , now I think on't better , for re - venge I 'll have the duke , and he shall have thy head , For thy false wit within it to his love :Now go and tell my father ; pray begone .
Why , and I will go .
Go , for God 's sake , go . Are you here yet ?
Well , now T am resolved .
' Tis bravely done ; farewell . But do you hear , sir ?
Take this with you , besides : the young prince keeps A certain letter you had writ for me ( "Endearing , " and " condoling , " and II mature " ) , And if you should deny things , that I hope
T04
If you can answer all this , why , 'tis well .
Well , lady , if you will assure me here You will refrain to meet with the young prince , I will say nothing .
Good sir , say your worst , For I will meet him , and that presently .
Then be content , I pray , and leave me out , And meet hereafter as you can yourselves .
No, no , sir , no ; 'tis you must fetch him to me , And you shall fetch him , or I 'll do your errand .
' Swounds , what a spite is this ; I will resolve T'endure the worst ; 'tis but my foolish fear The plot will be discover 'd : oh , the gods !
' Tis the best sport to play with these young dames ;
I have dissembled , mistress , all this while ;
Have I not made you in a pretty taking ?
Oh , 'tis most good ; thus you may play on me ;
You cannot be content to make me love A man I hated till you spake for him With such enchanting speeches as no friend Could possibly resist ; but you must use Your villanous wit , to drive me from my wits : A plague of that bewitching tongue of yours ;
Would I had never heard your scurvy words .
Pardon , dear dame , I 'll make amends , i'faith ;
Think you that I 'll play false with my dear Vince ?
I swore that sooner Hybla should want bees , And Italy bonarobbas , than i'faith, And so they shall .
Come , you shall meet , and double meet , in spite Of all your foes , and dukes that dare maintain them .
A plague of all old doters ; I disdain them .
Said like a friend ; oh , let me comb the coxcomb . \Exeunt .
Here is the place will do the deed , i'faith ;
1 his duke will show thee how youth puts down age , Ay , and . perhaps how youth does put down youth .
A I. If I shall see my love in any sortPrevented or abused , th ' abuser dies .
I hope there is no such intent , my liege , For sad as death should I be to behold it .
You must not be too confident , my lord , Or in your daughter or in them that guard her .
The prince is politic , and envies his father ;
And though not for himself , nor any good Intended to your daughter , yet because He knows 'twould kill his father , he would seek her .
Whist , whist , they come .
Come , meet me boldly , come .
And let them come from hunting when they dare .
Has the best spirit .
Spirit ? what a plague ;
Shall a man fear capriches ? you forsooth Must have your love come t'ye , and when he comes Then you grow shamefaced , and he must not touch you : But " fie , my father comes , " and "fo , my aunt ; "
Oh , 'tis a witty hearing , is't not , think you ?
Nay , pray thee , do not mock her , gentle friend .
Nay , you areeven as wise a wooertoo ;
If she turn from you , you even let her turn , And say you do not love to force a lady .
' Tis too much rudeness ; God save 't , what 's a lady ?
Must she not be touch 'd ? what , is she fine copper , think you , And will not bide the touchstone ? kiss her , Vince, And thou dost love me , kiss her .
Lady , now I were too simple if I should not offer .
O God ! sir , pray away ; this mantalks idly .

Oh , you have made him a sweet beagle , ha' y 'not ?
Tis the most true believer in himself ;
Of all that sect of folly faith 's his fault .
So , to her , Vince , I give thee leave , my lad .
" Sweet were the words my mistress spake , When tears fell from her eyes . "
\He lies down by them .
Thus , as the lion lies before his den , Guarding his whelps , and streaks his careless limbs , And when the panther , fox , or wolf comes near , He never deigns to rise , to fright them hence , But only puts forth one of his stern paws , And keeps his dear whelps safe , as in a hutch , So I present his person , and keep mine .
Foxes , go by , I put my terror forth .

Let all the world say what they can , Her bargain best she makes , That hath the wit to choose a manTo pay for that he takes .
Belle Plu . &amp;c . iterunt cant .
Dispatch , sweet whelps , the bug , the duke comes straight : Oh , 'tis a grave old lover , that same duke , And chooses minions rarely , if you mark him .
The noble Medice , that man , that Boba - dilla , That foolish knave , that hose and doublet stinkard .
' Swounds , my lord ! rise , let 's endure no more .
A I. A. little , pray , my lord , for I believeWe shall discover very notable knavery .
Alas , how I am grieved and shamed in this !
Never care you , lord brother ; there 's no harm done .
But that sweet creature , my good lord 's sister , Madam Corteza , she , the noblest dameThat ever any vein of honour bled ;
There were a wife now , for my lord the duke , Had he the grace to choose her ; but indeed , To speak her true praise , I must use some study .
Now truly , brother , I did ever think This man the honestest man that e 'er you kept .
So , sister , so ; because he praises you .
Nay , sir , but you shall hear him further yet .
Were not her head sometimes a little light , And so unapt for matter of much weight ;
She were the fittest and the worthiest dame To leap a window and to break her neckThat ever was .
God 's pity , arrant knave ;
I ever thought him a dissembling varlet .
Oh , fine phrase !
And very timely used .
What now , sweet life , shall we resolve upon ?
We never shall enjoy each other here .
Direct you , then , my lord , what we shall do , For I am at your will , and will endure With you , the cruell 'st absence from the state We both were born to , that can be supposed .
That would extremely grieve me .
Could myself Only endure the ill , our hardest fatesMay lay on both of us , I would not care ;
But to behold thy sufferance , I should die .
How can your lordship wrong my love so much , To think the more woe I sustain for you Breeds not the more my comfort ? I , alas , Have no mean else to make my merit evenIn any measure , with your eminent worth .
Now must I exercise my timorous lovers , Like fresh-arm 'd soldiers , with some false alarms , To make them yare and wary of their foe , I The boisterous , bearded duke : I 'll rush upon them With a most hideous cry , " The duke ! the duke ! the duke ! "
Ha , ha , ha , wo ho , come again , I say, The duke 's not come , i'faith .
God 's precious man , What did you mean to put us in this fear io6
What ! can you be too safe , sir ? What , I say , Must you be pamper 'd in your vanities ?
Ah , I do domineer , and rule the roast .

Minion , you have your prayer , and my curse , For your good huswifery .
What says your highness ?
Can you endure these injuries any more ?
A I. No more , no more ; advise me what is best To be the penance of my graceless son .
My lord , no mean but death or banishment Can be fit penance for him : if you mean T' enjoy the pleasure of your love yourself .
Give him plain death , my lord , and then y 'are sure .
A I. Death , or his banishment , he shall endure , For wreak of that joy 's exile I sustain .
I have some jewels then , my dearest life , Which , with whatever we can get beside , Shall be our means , and we will makeescape .
'Sblood ! the duke and all come now in earnest .
The duke , by heaven , the duke I Vi . Nay , then , i'faithYour jest is too too stale .
God 's precious , By these ten bones , and by this hat and heart , The duke and all comes ! See , we are castaway . {Exeunt .
A I. Lay hands upon them all ; pursue ,pursue !
Stay , thou ungracious girl .
A I. Lord Medice , Lead you our guard , and see you appre - hend The treacherous boy , nor let him 'scape with life , Unless he yield to his eternal exile .
And take my usher .
Let me go into exile with my lord .
I will not live , if I be left behind .
Impudent damsel ! wouldst thou follow him ?
He is my husband ; whom else should I follow ?
Wretch ! thou speakest treason to my lord the duke .
A I. Yet love me , ladv , and I pardon all .
I have a husband , and must love none else .
Despiteful dame , I 'll disinherit him , And thy good father here shall cast off thee , And both shall feed on air , or starve , and die .
If this be justice , let it be our dooms : If free and spotless love in equal years , With honours unimpair 'd deserve such ends , Let us approve what justice is in friends .
You shall , I swear . Sister , take you her close Into your chamber ; lock her fast alone, And let her stir nor speak with any one .
She shall not , brother . Come , niece , come with me .
Haste , Julio ! follow thou my son 's pursuit , And will Lord Medice not to hurt nor touch him , But either banish him or bring him back :Charge him to use no violence to his life .
A I. Oh , Nature ! how , alas Art thou and Reason , thy true guide , opposed !
More bane thou takest to guide sense led amiss , Than being guided , Reason gives the bliss .

Now , see , good doctor , 'twas no frantic fancy That made my tongue presage this head should fall Out of my wounded side the seventh day ;
107 Submitted and conjoin 'd in patience To my Creator , in whom I foresaw( Like to an angel ) this divine event .
So is it plain , and happily approved , In a right Christian precedent , confirming What a most sacred medicine patience is , That , with the high thirst of our souls ' clear fire Exhausts corporeal humour ; and all pain,Casting our flesh off , while we it retain .
Make some religious vow then , my 'dear lord , And keep it in the proper memoryOf so celestial and free a grace .
Sweet wife , thou restest my good angel still , Suggesting by all means these ghostly counsels .
Thou weariest not thy husband 's patient ears , With motions for new fashions in attire , For change of jewels , pastimes , and nice cates , Nor studiest eminence and the higher place Amongst thy consorts , like all other dames : But knowing more worthy objects appertain To every woman that desires t ' enjoy A blessed life in marriage : thou contemn 'st Those common pleasures , and pursuest the rare , Using thy husband in those virtuous gifts : For which thou first didst choose him , and thereby Cloy 'st not with him , but lovest him endlessly .
In reverence of thy motion then , and zeal To that most sovereign power that was my cure , I make a vow to go on foot to Rome , And offer humbly in S. Peter 's Temple This fatal arrow-head : which work let none judge A superstitious rite , but a right use , Proper to this peculiar instrument , Which visibly resign 'd to memory Through every eye that sees , will stir the soul To gratitude and progress , in the use Of my tried patience , which in my powers ending Would shut th ' example out of future lives .
No act is superstitious that applies All power to God , devoting hearts through eyes .
Spoke with the true tongue of a nobleman .
But now are all these excitations toys , And honour fats his brain with other joys .
I know your true friend , Prince Vincentio , Will triumph in this excellent effectOf your late prophecy .
Oh , my dear friend 's name Presents my thoughts with a most mortal danger To his right innocent life : a monstrous factIs now effected on him .
Where ? or how ?
I do not well those circumstances know , But am assured the substance is too true .
Come , reverend doctor , let us harken out Where the young prince remains , and bear with you Medicines , t* allay his danger : if by wounds , Bear precious balsam , or some sovereign juice ;
If by fell poison , some choice antidote ;
If by black witchcraft , our good spirits and prayers Shall exorcise the devilish wrath of hellOut of his princely bosom .
Where ? where ? where ? where 'smy lord uncle , my lord my uncle ?
Here 's the ill-tidings bringer ; what news now , With thy unhappy presence ?
Oh , my lord , my Lord Vincentio , isalmost killed by my Lord Medice .
See , doctor , see , if my presage be true ;
And well I know if he have hurt the prince , ' Tis treacherously done , or with much help .
Nay , sure he had no help , but all the duke 's guard ; and they set upon him indeed ; and after he had defended himself , d'ye see ? he drew , and having as good as wounded the Lord Medice almost , he strake at him , and missed him , d'ye mark ?
What tale is here ? where is this mischief done ?
At Monks-well , my lord ; I 'll guide you to him presently .
I doubt it not ; fools are best guides to ill , And mischief 's ready way lies open still .
Lead , sir , I pray . \_Excunt .
Quiet yourself , niece ; though your love be slain, You have another that 's worth two of him .
It is not possible ; it cannot beThat heaven should suffer such impiety .
' Tis true , I swear , niece .
io8
I 'll cast myself down headlong from this tower , And force an instant passage for my soulTo seek the wandering spirit of my lord .
Will you do so , niece ? That I hope you will not ;
And yet there was a maid in Saint Mark 's street For such a matter did so , and her clothesFlew up about her so , as she had no harm ;
And , grace of God , your clothes may fly up too , And save you harmless , for your cause and hersAre e 'en as like as can be .
I would not 'scape ;
And certainly I think the death is easy .
Oh , 'tis the easiest death that ever was ;
Look , niece , it is so far hence to the ground You should be quite dead long before you felt it ;
Yet do not leap , niece .
I will kill myself With running on some sword , or drink strong poison ;
Which death is easiest I would fain endure .
Sure Cleopatra was of the same mind , And did so , she was honour 'd ever since ;
Yet do not you so , niece .
Wretch that I am , my heart is soft and faint , And trembles at the very thought of death , Though thoughts tenfold more grievous do torment it : I 'll feel death by degrees , and first deformThis my accursed face with ugly wounds ;
That was the first cause of my dear love 's death .
That were a cruel deed ; yet Adelasia , In Pettie 's Palace of Petit Pleasure , For all the world , with such a knife as this Cut off her cheeks and nose , and was commended More than all dames that kept their faces whole :Oh , do not cut it .
Fie on my faint heart , It will not give my hand the wished strength ;
Behold the just plague of a sensual life , That to preserve itself in reason 's spite , And shun death 's horror , feels it ten times more .
Unworthy women , why do men adore Our fading beauties , when their worthiest lives Being lost for us , we dare not die for them ?
Hence , hapless ornaments , that adorn 'd this head , Disorder ever these enticing curls , And leave my beauty like a wilderness That never man 's eye more may dare t 'invade .
I 'll tell you , niece , and yet I will not tell you A thing that I desire to have you do ;
But I will tell you only what you might do ,'Cause I would pleasure you in all I could .
I have an ointment here , which we dames use To take off hair when it does grow too low Upon our foreheads ; and that for a need , If you should rub it hard upon your face Would blister it , and make it look most vilely .
Oh , give me that , aunt .
Give it you , virgin ? That were well indeed ;
Shall I be thought to tempt you to such matters ?
None ( of my faith ) shall know it ; ' gentle aunt , Bestow it on me , and I 'll ever love you .
God 's pity ! but you shall not spoil your face .
\ will not then , indeed .
Why , then , niece , take it ;
But you shall swear you will not .
No, I swear .
What ! do you force it from me ?
God 's , my dear , Will you misuse your face so ? What , all over ?
Nay , if you be so desperate , I 'll be gone .

See , precious love , if thou be it in air .
And canst break darkness , and the strongest towers With thy dissolved intellectual powers , See a worse torment suffer 'd for thy death Than if it had extended his black forceIn sevenfold horror to my hated life .
109 That eat his own child with the jaws oflust . {Exeunt .
I wonder how far they pursued my son , That no return of him or them appears ;
I fear some hapless accident is chanced That makes the news so loth to pierce mine ears .
High heaven vouchsafe no such effect succeed Those wretched causes that from my house flow , But that in harmless love all acts may end .
What shall I do ! Alas , I cannot rule My desperate niece ; all her sweet face is spoil 'd , And I dare keep her prisoner no more .
See , see , she comes frantic and all undress 'd .
Tyrant ! behold how thou hast used thy love ;
See , thief to nature , thou hast kill 'd and robb 'd , Kill 'd what myself kill 'd , robb 'd what makes thee poor .
Beauty ( a lover 's treasure ) thou hast lost , Where none can find it ; all a poor maid 's dower Thou hast forced from me ; all my joy and hope .
No man will love me more ; all dames excel me , This ugly thing is now no more a face , Nor any vile form in all earth resembles But thy foul tyranny ; for which all the pains Two faithful lovers feel , that thus are parted , All joys they might have felt turn all to pains ;
All a young virgin thinks she does endure To lose her love and beauty ; on thy heart Be heap 'd and press 'd down , till thy soul depart .
Haste , liege ! your son is dangerously hurt .
Lord Medice , contemning your command , By me deliver 'd , as your highness will 'd , Set on him with your guard ; who struck him down ;
And then the coward lord , with mortal wounds And slavish insolence , plcw 'd up his soft breast ;
Which barbarous fact , in part , is laid on you , For first enjoining it , and foul exclaims In pity of your son , your subjects breathe ' Gainst your unnatural fury ; amongst whom The good Lord Strozza desperately raves , And vengeance for his friend 's injustice craves .
See where he comes , burning in zeal of friendship .
Where is the tyrant ? Let me strike his eyes Into his brain with horror of an object .
See , Pagan Nero ; see how thou hast ripp 'd Thy better bosom ; rooted up that flower From whence thy now spent life should spring anew , And in him kill 'd ( that would have bred thee fresh ) Thy mother and thy father .
Good friend , cease .
What hag with child of monster would have nursed Such a prodigous longing ? But a father Would rather eat the brawn out of his arms Than glut the mad worm of his wild de- sires With his dear issue 's entrails .
Honour 'd friend , He is my father , and he is my prince , In both whose rights he may command my life .
What is a father ? turn his entrails gulfs To swallow children , when they havebegot them ?
And what 's a prince ? Had all been vir- tuous men , There never had been prince upon the earth , And so no subject ; all men had been princes : A virtuous man is subject to no prince , But to his soul and honour ; which are laws That carry fire and sword within them - selves Never corrupted , never out of rule ;

How thick and heavily my plagues descend !
Not giving my 'mazed powers a time to speak : Pour more rebuke upon me , worthy lord , For I have guilt and patience for them all ;
Yet know , dear son , I did forbid thy harm ;
This gentleman can witness whom I sent With all command of haste to interdict This ' forward man in mischief not to touch thee : Did I not , Julio ? utter nought but truth .
Ju , All your guard heard , my lord ; I gave your charge , With loud and violent iterations , After all which , Loid Medice cowardly hurt him .
The Guard . He did , my princely lord .
Believe then , son , And know me pierced as deeply with thy wounds ;
And pardon , virtuous lady , that have lost The dearest treasure proper to your sex ,Ay me , it seems by my unhappy means !
Oh , would to God , I could with present cure Of these unnatural wounds , and moaning right Of this abused beauty , join you both( As last I left you ) in eternal nuptials .
VL My lord , I know the malice of this man , Not your unkind consent hath used us thus .
And since I make no doubt I shall survive These fatal dangers , and your grace is pleased To give free course to my unwounded love ;
' Tis not this outward beauty 's ruthful loss Can any thought discourage my desires : And therefore , dear life , do not wrong me so , To think my love the shadow of your beauty .
I woo your virtues , which as I am sureNo accident can alter or impair ;
So , be you certain nought can change my love .
I know your honourable mind , my lord , And will not do it that unworthy wrong , To let it spend her forces in contending
It is enough for me , my lord , you love , And that my beauty 's sacrifice redeem 'd My sad fear of your slaughter . You first loved me Closely for beauty ; which being wither 'd thus , Your love must fade : when the most needful rights Of Fate , and Nature , have dissolved your life , And that your love must needs be all in soul , Then will we meet again ; and then , dear love , Love me again ; for then \vill beauty beOf no respect with love 's eternity .
Nor is it now ; I woo 'd your beauty first But as a lover ; now as a dear husband, That title and your virtues bind me ever .
Alas ! that title is of little force To stir up men 's affections ; when wives want Outward excitements , husbands ' loves grow scant .
Assist me , heaven ; and art , give me your mask ;
Open , thou little store-house of great nature , Use an elixir drawn through seven years ' fire ;
That like Medea 's caldron can repair The ugliest loss of living temperature j And for this princely pair of virtuous turtles , Be lavish of thy precious influence .
Lady , t ' atone your honourable strife , And take all let from your love 's tender eyes , Let me for ever hide this stain of beauty With this recureful mask ; here be it fix 'd With painless operation ; of itself , ( Your beauty having brook 'd three days ' eclipse ) Like a dissolved cloud it shall fall off , And your fair looks regain their freshest rays ;
So shall your princely friend ( if heaven consent ) In twice your suffer 'd date renew recure .
Let me then have the honour to conjoin Your hands , conformed to your constant hearts .
Grave Benevemus , honourable doctor , On whose most sovereign /Esculapian hand , Fame , with her richest miracles , attends ;
Be fortunate , as ever heretofore , That we may quite thee both with gold and honour , And by thy happy means have power to make My son and his much injured love amends , Whose well-proportion 'd choice we now applaud , And bless all those that ever further 'd it .
Where is your discreet usher , my good lord , The special furtherer of this equal match ?
Brought after by a couple of your fuard .
Let him be fetch 'd , that we may dohim grace .
I 'll fetch him , my lord ; away , you must not go . Oh , here he comes . Oh , master Usher , I am sorry for you : you mustpresently be chopped in pieces .
Woe to that wicked prince that e 'er I saw him .
Come , come ; I gull you , master Usher , you are like to be the duke 's minion , man ; d'ye think I would have been seen in your company , and you had been out of favour ? Here 's my friend master Usher ,my lord .
Give me your hand , friend ; pardon us , I pray .
We much have wrong 'd your worth , as one that knew The fitness of this match above ourselves .
Sir , I did all things for the best , I swear , And you must think I would not have been gull 'd ;
I know what 's fit , sir , as I hope you know now .
Sweet Vince , how farest thou ? Be of honour 'd cheer .
Vince , does he call him ? Oh , fool dost thou callThe prince Vince , like his equal ?
Oh , my lord , alas !
You know not what has pass 'd betwixt us two .
Here in thy bosom I will lie , sweet Vince, And die if thou die , I protest by heaven .
I know not what this means .
Nor I , my lord ;
But sure he saw the fitness of the matchWith freer and more noble eyes than we .
Why , I saw that as well as he , my lord . I knew 'twas a foolish match be- wixt you two ; did not you think so , my Lord Vincentio ? Lord uncle , did not I ay at first of the duke : " Will his antiquitynever leave his iniquity ? "
Go to , too much of this ; but askthis lord if he did like it .
Who , my Lord Medice ?
Lord Stinkard , man , his name is .
Ask him . Lord Stinkard , did you like thematch ? Say .
My Lord Stinkard , did you like the match betwixt the duke and my LadyMargaret ?
Presumptuous sycophant ! I willhave thy life .
Unworthy lord , put up : thirst 'st thou more blood ?
Thy life is fittest to be call 'd in question For thy most murtherous cowardice on my son ;
Thy forwardness to every crueltyCalls thy pretended noblesse in suspect .
Noblesse , my lord ? set by your princely favour That gave the lustre to his painted state , Who ever view 'd him but with deep con- tempt , As reading vileness in his very looks ?
And if he prove not son of some base drudge , Trimm 'd up by Fortune , being disposed to jest And dally with your state , then that good angel That by divine relation spake in me , Foretelling these foul dangers to your son , And without notice brought this reverend man To rescue him from death , now fails my tongue , And I 'll confess I do him open wrong .
And so thou dost ; and I return all note Of infamy or baseness on thy throat :Damn me , my lord , if I be not a lord .
My liege , with all desert , even now you said His life was duly forfeit , for the death Which in these barbarous wounds he sought your son ;
Vouchsafe me then his life , in my friend s right , For many ways I know he merits death ;
Which ( if you grant ) will instantly appear, And that I feel with some rare miracle .
His life is thine , Lord Strozza ; give him death .
What , my lord , Will your grace cast away an innocent life ?
112
Recall your word , my lord .
A I. Not for the world .
Oh , my dear liege , but that my spirit prophetic Hath inward feeling of such sins in him As ask the forfeit of his life and soul , I would , before I took his life , give leave To his confession , and his penitence : Oh , he would tell you most notorious wonders Of his most impious state ; but life and soul Must suffer for it in him , and my hand Forbidden is from heaven to let him live Till by confession he may have forgiveness .
Die therefore , monster .
Oh , be not so uncharitable , sweet friend , Let him confess his sins , and ask heaven pardon .
He must not , princely friend ; it is heaven 's justice To plague his life and soul , and here 's heaven 's justice .
Oh , save my life , my lord .
Hold , good Lord Strozza .
Let him confess the sins that heaven hath told you , And ask forgiveness .
Let me , good my lord, And I 'll confess what you accuse me of ;
Wonders indeed , and full of damn 'd deserts .
I know it , and I must not let thee liveTo ask forgiveness .
A I. But you shall , my lord , Or I will take his life out of your hand .
A little then I am content , my liege :Is thy name Medice ?
No, my noble lord , My true name is Mendice .
Mendice ? see , At first a mighty scandal done to honour .
Of what country art thou ?
Of no country I , But born upon the seas , my mother passing'Twixt Zant and Venice .
Where wert thou christen 'd ?
I was never christen 'd , But being brought up with beggars , call 'd Mendice .
A I. Strange and unspeakable !
How earnest thou then To bear the port thou didst , entering this Court ?
My lord , when I was young , being able-limb 'd , A captain of the gipsies entertain 'd me , And many years I lived a loose life with them .
At last I was so favour 'd , that they made me The king of gipsies ; and being told my fortune By an old sorceress that I should be great In some great Prince 's love , I took the treasure Which all our company of gipsies hadIn many years by several stealths collected ;
And leaving them in wars , I lived abroad With no less show than now ; and my last wrong I did to noblesse , was in this high Court .
Never was heard so strange a counterfeit .
Didst thou not cause me to be shot in hunting ?
I did , my lord ; for which , for heaven 's love , pardon .
Now let him live , my lord ; his blood 's least drop Would stain your Court , more than the sea could cleanse ;
His soul 's too foul to expiate with death .
Hence then ; be ever banish 'd from my rule , And live a monster , loathed of all the world .
I 'll get boys and bait him out a' th ' Court , my lord .
Do so , I pray thee ; rid me of his sight .
Come on , my Lord Stinkard , I 'll play Fo , Fox , come out of thy hole with you , i'faith .
I 'll run and hide me from the sight of heaven .
Fox , fox , go out of thy hole ; a twolegged fox , a two-legged fox !

Let us forget it , honourable friends , And satisfy all wrongs with my son 's right , In solemn marriage of his love and him .
I humbly thank your highness : honour 'd doctor , The balsam you infused into my wounds , Hath eased me much , and given me sudden strength Enough t 'assure all danger is exempt That any way may let the general joyMy princely father speaks of in our nuptials .
Which , my dear son , shall , with thy full recure , Be celebrate in greater majestyThan ever graced our greatest ancestry .
Then take thy love , which heaven with all joys bless, And make ye both mirrors of happiness .
