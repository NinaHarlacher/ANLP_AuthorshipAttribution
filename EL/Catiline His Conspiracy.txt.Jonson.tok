Sylla 's Ghost .
DOst thou not feel me , Rome ? not yet ? Is
Night
So heavy on thee , and my weight so light ?
Can Sylla 's Ghost arise within thy Walls
Less threatning than an Earthquake , the quick falls
Of thee and thine ? Shake not the frighted heads
Of thy steep Towers ? or shrink to their first Beds ?
Or , as their Ruine the large Tyber fills ,
Make that swell up , and drown thy seven proud Hills ?
What sleep is this doth seize thee so like Death ,
And is not it ? VVake , feel her my in breath :
Behold I come , sent from the Stygian Sound ,
As a dire Vapor that had cleft the ground ,
T' ingender with the Night , and blast the Day ;
Or like a Pestilence that should display
Infection through the world : which thus I do .
Pluto be at thy Councels , and into
Thy darker bosome enter Sylla 's Spirit :
All that was mine , and bad , thy breast inherit .
Did I but say (vain voice ! ) all that was mine ?
All that the Gracchi , Cinna , Marius would :
VVhat now , had I a Body again , I could ,
Coming from Hell ; what Fiends would wish should be ;
And Hannibal could not have wish 'd to see :
Think thou , and practice . Let the long hid Seeds
Of Treason in thee , now shoot fortb in Deeds
Ranker than Horror ; and thy former Facts
Conscience of them provoke thee on to more .
Be still thy Incests , Murders , Rapes before
Thy Sense ; thy forcing first a Vestal Nun ;
Thy Parricide , late , on thy own only Son ,
After his Mother ; to make empty way
For thy last wicked Nuptials ; worse than they
That blaze that act of thy incestuous Life ,
VVhich got thee at once a daughter and a wife .
I leave the slaughters that thou didst for me
Of Senators ; for which , I hid for thee
Thy Murder of thy Brother , ( being so brib 'd )
And writ him in the List of my proscrib 'd
After thy Fact , to save thy little shame :
Thy Incest with thy Sister , I not name .
These are too light . Fate will have thee pursue
Deeds , after which no mischief can be new ;
The Ruin of thy Countrey : thou wert built
For such a work , and born for no less guilt .
What though defeated once th ' hast been , and known ,
Tempt it again : That is thy act , or none .
What all the several Ills that visit Earth ,
( Brought forth by Night , with a sinister birth )
The Sword , nor Surfeits ; let thy Fury do :
Make all past , present , future Ill thine own ;
And conquer all Example in thy one .
Nor let thy thought find any vacant time
To hate an old , but still a fresher Crime
Drown the remembrance : let not mischief cease ,
But while it is in punishing , increase .
Conscience and Care die in thee ; and be free
Not Heav'n it self , from thy Impiety :
Let Night grow blacker with thy Plots , and Day ,
At shewing but thy Head forth , start away
From this half-sphear : and leave Rome 's blinded Walls
T' embrace Lusts , Hatreds , Slaughters , Funerals ,
And not recover sight till their own flames
Do light them to their Ruines . All the Names
Of thy Confederates too , be no less great
In Hell than here : that when we would repeat
Our strengths in muster , we may name you all ,
And Furies upon you for Furies call .
Whilst what you do may strike them into fears ,
Or make them grieve , and wish your mischief theirs .
IT is decree 'd . Nor shall thy Fate , O Rome ,
Resist my vow . Tho Hills were set on Hills ,
And Seas met Seas to guard thee , I would through :
I plough up Rocks , steep as the Alpes , in dust ;
And lave the Tyrrhene Waters into Clouds ;
But I would reach thy Head , thy Head , proud City .
The Ills that I have done cannot be safe
But by attempting greater ; and I feel
A Spirit within me chides my sluggish hands ,
And says , they have been innocent too long .
Was I a man bred great as Rome her self ?
One form 'd for all her Honours , all her Glories ?
Equal to all her Titles ? that could stand
Close up with Atlas , and sustain her Name
As strong as he doth Heaven ? And was I ,
Of all her Brood , mark 'd out for the repulse
By her no voice , when I stood Candidate ,
To be Commander in the Pontick War ?
I will hereafter call her Step-dame ever !
If she can lose her Nature , I can lose
My Piety ; and in her stony Entrails
Dig me a Seat : where I will live again ,
The labour of her Womb , and be a burden
Weightier than all the Prodigies and Monsters
That she hath teem 'd with , since she first knew Mars .
WHo 's there ? Aur . ' Tis I. Cat . Aurelia ?
Yes . Cat . Appear ,
And break like day , my Beauty , to this Circle :
Upbraid thy Ph?bus , that he is so long
In mounting to that point , which should give thee
Thy proper splendor . Wherefore frowns my Sweet ?
Have I too long been absent from these Lips ,
This Cheek , these Eyes ? What is my trespass ? speak .
It seems you know , that can accuse your self .
I will redeem it .
Still you say so . When ?
When Orestilla , by her bearing well
These my Retirements , and stoln times for thought ,
Shall give their Effects leave to call her Queen
Of all the world , in place of humbled Rome .

You court me now .
As I would always , Love ,
By this Ambrosiack Kiss , and this of Nectar ,
Wouldst thou but hear as gladly as I speak .
Could my Aurelia think I meant her less ;
When wooing her , I first remov 'd a Wife ,
And then a Son , to make my Bed and House
Spatious , and fit t ' embrace her ? These were Deeds
Not t ' have begun with , but to end with more
And greater : " He that , building , stays at one
" Floor , or the second , hath erected none .
' Twas how to raise thee I was meditating ;
To make some act of mine answer thy Love :
That Love , that when my State was now quite sunk ,
Came with thy wealth , and weigh 'd it up again ,
And made my 'emergent Fortune once more look
Above the Main ; which now shall hit the Stars ,
And stick my Orestilla there amongst 'em ,
If any Tempest can but make the Billow ,
And any Billow can but lift her Greatness .
But I must pray my Love , she will put on
Like Habits with my self . I have to do
With many Men and many Natures . Some
That must be blown and sooth 'd ; as Lentulus ,
Whom I have heav 'd with magnifying his Blood ,
And a vain Dream out of the Sybill 's Books ,
That a third man of that great Family
Whereof he is descended , the Cornelii ,
Should be a King in Rome : which I have hir 'd
The flattering Augures to interpret him ,
Cinna and Sylla dead . Then bold Cethegus ,
Whose Valour I have turn 'd into his Poyson ,
And prais 'd so into daring , as he would
Go on upon the Gods , kiss Lightning , wrest
The Engine from the Cyclops , and give fire
At face of a full Cloud , and stand his Ire ,
When I would bid him move . Others there are ,
Whom Envy to the State draws , and puts on
For Contumelies receiv 'd , ( and such are sure ones )
As Curius , and the fore-nam 'd Lentulus ,
Both which have been degraded in the Senate ,
And must have their Disgraces still new rubb 'd ,
To make 'em smart , and labour of Revenge .
Others whom meer Ambition fires , and dole
Of Provinces abroad , which they have feign 'd
To their crude hopes , and I as amply promis 'd :
Some whom their Wants oppress , as th ' idle Captains
Of Sylla 's Troops : and divers Roman Knights
( The profuse wasters of their Patrimonies )
So threatned with their Debts , as they will now
Run any desperate Fortune for a Change .
These for a time we must relieve , Aurelia ,
And make our House the Safe-guard : like for those
That fear the Law , or stand within her gripe ,
For any act past , or to come . Such will
From their own Crimes be factious , as from ours .
Some more there be , slight Airlings , will be won
With Dogs and Horses , or perhaps a Whore ;
Which must be had : and if they venture Lives
For us , Aurelia , we must hazard Honours
A little . Get thee store and change of women ,
As I have boys ; and give 'em time and place ,
And all connivence : be thy self , too , courtly ;
And entertain , and feast , sit up , and revel ;
Call all the great , the fair , and spirited Dames
Of Rome about thee : and begin a fashion
Of Freedom and Community . Some will thank thee ,
Tho the sowr Senate frown , whose heads must ake
In fear and feeling too . We must not spare
Or cost or modesty . It can but shew
Like one of Juno 's or of Jove 's disguises ,
In either thee or me : and will as soon ,
When things succeed , be thrown by , or let fall ,
As is a Vail put off , a Visor chang 'd ,
Or the Scene shifted , in our Theaters ?
Who 's that ? It is the voice of Lentulus .
Or of Cethegus .
In , my fair Aurelia ,
And think upon these Arts . They must not see
How far you are trusted with these Privacies ;
Tho on their shoulders , necks , and heads you rise .
IT is , methinks , a morning full of fate !
It riseth slowly , as her sullen care
Had all the weights of sleep and death hung at it !
She is not Rosie-finger 'd , but swoln black !
Her Face is like a water turn 'd to blood ,
And her sick Head is bound about with Clouds ,
As if she threatned Night e 're Noon of Day !
It does not look as it would have a Hail
Or Health wish 'd in it , as on other Morns .
Why , all the fitter , Lentulus : Our coming
Is not for Salutation , we have Business .
Said nobly , brave Cethegus . Where 's Autronius ?
Is he not come ? Cat . Not here .
Not Vargunteius ?
Neither .
A fire in their Beds and Bosoms ,
That so will serve their Sloth rather than Vertue .
They are no Romans , and at such high need
As now . Len . Both they , Longinus , Lecca , Curius ,
By Lucius Bestia , they would all be here ,
And early .
Yes ? As you , had I not call 'd you .
Come , we all sleep , and are meer Dormice ; Flies
A little less than dead : more dulness hangs
On us than on the morn . W' are spirit bound ,
In Ribs of Ice ; our whole Bloods are one Stone ;
And Honour cannot thaw us , nor our Wants ,
Tho they burn hot as Fevers to our States .
I muse they would be tardy at an hour
Of so great purpose .
If the Gods had call 'd
Them to a purpose , they would just have come
With the same Tortoyse speed ! that are thus slow
As asking no less means than all their Powers
Conjoyn 'd , t ' effect . I would have seen Rome burnt
By this time , and her Ashes in an Urn :
The Kingdom of the Senate rent asunder ;
And the degenerate talking Gown run frighted
Out of the Air of Italy .
Spirit of Men !
Thou Heart of our great Enterprise ! how much
I love these Voices in thee !
O , the days
Of Sylla 's Sway , when the free Sword took leave
To act all that it would !
And was familiar
With Entrails , as our Augures .
Sons kill 'd Fathers ,
Brothers their Brothers .
And had Price and Praise .
All Hate had Licence given it ; all Rage reigns .
Slaughter bestrid the Streets , and stretch 'd himself
To seem more huge ; whilst to his stained thighs
The Gore he drew flow 'd up , and carried down
Whole heaps of Limbs and Bodies through his Arch .
No Age was spar 'd , no Sex .
Nay , no Degree .
Not Infants in the Porch of Life were free .
The Sick , the Old , that could but hope a Day
Longer by Natures Bounty , not let stay .
Virgins , and Widows , Matrons , pregnant Wives ,
All
All died . Cat . ' Twas Crime enough , that they had Lives .
To strike but only those that could do hurt ,
VVas dull and poor . Some fell to make the Number ,
As some the Prey . Cet . The rugged Charon fainted ,
And ask 'd a Navy , rather than a Boat ,
To ferry over the sad VVorld that came :
The Maws and Dens of Beasts could not receive
The Bodies that those Souls were frighted from ;
And ev'n the Graves were fill 'd with Men , yet living ,
VVhose Flight and Fear had mix 'd them with the Dead .
And this shall be again , and more , and more ,
Now Lentulus , the third Cornelius ,
Is to stand up in Rome . Len . Nay , urge not that
Is so uncertain . Cat . How ! Len . I mean , not clear 'd ,
And therefore not to be reflected on .
The Sybils Leaves uncertain ! or the Comments
Of our grave , deep , divining Men , not clear !
All Prophecies , you know , suffer the torture .
But this already hath confess 'd , without ;
And so been weigh 'd , examin 'd , and compar 'd ,
As 'twere malicious Ignorance in him
VVould faint in the Belief . Len . Do you believe it ?
Do I love Lentulus , or pray to see it ?
The Augures all are constant , I am meant .
They ' had lost their Science else .
They count from Cinna .
And Sylla next , and so make you the third ;
All that can say the Sun is ris'n , must think it .
Men mark me more of late , as I come forth !
VVhy , what can they do less ? Cinna and Sylla
Are set , and gone ; and we must turn our Eyes
On him that is , and shines . Noble Cethegus ,
But view him with me , here ! He looks already
As if he shook a Scepter ore the Senate ,
And the aw 'd Purple dropt their Rods and Axes !
The Statues melt again , and Houshold Gods
In Groans confess the Travels of the City :
The very VValls sweat Blood before the Change ;
And Stones start out to Ruin , ere it comes .
But he , and we , and all are idle still .
I am your Creature , Sergius ; and what ere
The Great Cornelian Name shall win to be ,
It is not Augury , nor the Sybils Books ,
To honour 'd Lentulus , and Cethegus here ,
VVho are the Heirs of Mars . Cet . By Mars himself ,
Earth cannot make a Shadow great enough ,
Though Envy should come too . O , there they are .
Now we shall talk more , though we yet do nothing .
H Hail , Publius Lentulus .
Hail , the third Cornelius .
Caius Cethegus , hail .
Hail , Sloth and Words ,
In stead of Men and Spirits . Cat . Nay , dear Caius ?
Are your Eyes yet unseel 'd ? Dare they look Day
In the dull Face ? Cat . He 's zealous for th ' Affair ,
And blames your tardy coming Gentlemen .
Unless we had sold our selves to Sleep and Ease ,
And would be our Slaves Slaves ? Cat . Pray you forbear .
The North is not so stark and cold .
Cethegus ? ?
We shall redeem all , if your Fire will let us .
You are too full of Lightning , noble Caius .
Boy , see all Doors be shut , that none approach us
On this part of the House . Go you , and bid
The Priest , he kill the Slave I mark 'd last night ,
And bring me of his Blood , when I shall call him :
Till then , wait all without . Var . How is't , Autronius ?
Longinus ? Lon . Curius ? Cur . Lecca ?
Feel you nothing ?
A strange unwonted Horror doth invade me ,
I know not what it is ! Lec. The Day goes back ,
Or else my Senses ! Cur . As at Atreus Feast !
Darkness grows more and more !
The Vestal Flame , I think , be out .
is heard under ground .
What Groan was that ?
Our Phant 'sies .
Strike Fire out of our selves , and force a Day .
Again it sounds !
As all the City gave it !
We fear what our selves feign .
What Light is this ?
Look forth . Len . It still grows greater !
From whence comes it ?
A bloody Arm it is , that holds a Pine
Lighted , above the Capitol ! and now
It waves unto us ! Cat . Brave and ominous !
Our Enterprise is seal 'd . Cet . In spite of Darkness ,
That would discountenance it . Look no more ;
We lose time , and our selves . To what we came for ,
Speak Lucius , we attend you . Cat . Noblest Romans ,
If you were less , or that your Faith and Vertue
Did not hold good that Title , with your Blood ,
I should not now unprofitably spend
My self in Words , or catch at empty Hopes ,
By airy ways , for solid Certainties .
But since in many , and the greatest Dangers
I still have known you no less true than valiant ,
And that I taste in you the same Affections ,
To will or nill , to think things good or bad ,
Alike with me , ( which argues your firm Friendship )
I dare the boldlier , with you , set on foot ,
What I have thought of it afore , you all
Have heard a part . I then express 'd my Zeal
Unto the Glory ; now , the Need enflames me .
When I forethink the hard Conditions
Our States must undergo , except in time
We do redeem our selves to Liberty ,
And break the Iron Yoke forg 'd for our Necks :
For what less can we call it ? when we see
The Commonwealth engross 'd so by a few ,
The Giants of the State , that do by turns
Enjoy her , and defile her ! All the Earth ,
Her Kings and Tetrarchs , are their Tributaries ;
People and Nations pay them hourly Stipends ;
The Riches of the VVorld flows to their Coffers ,
And not to Romes . VVhile ( but those few ) the rest ,
However Great we are , Honest , and Valiant ,
Are herded with the Vulgar , and so kept ,
As we were only bred to consume Corn ,
Or wear our VVooll ; to drink the Cities VVater ;
Ungrac 'd , without Authority , or Mark ;
Trembling beneath their Rods : to whom ( if all
Were well in Rome ) we should come forth bright Axes .
All Places , Honours , Offices are theirs ,
Or where they will confer 'em ! They leave us
The Dangers , the Repulses , Judgments , VVants ;
VVhich how long will you bear , most valiant Spirits ?
VVere we not better to fall once with Vertue ,
Than draw a wretched and dishonour 'd Breath ,
To lose with Shame , when these Mens Pride will laugh ?
I call the Faith of Gods and Men to question ,
The Power is in our Hands , our Bodies able ,
Our Minds as strong ; o ' th ' contrary , in them
All things grown aged , with their VVealth and Years :
There wants but only to begin the Business ,
The Issue is certain . Cet . Lon . On , let us go on .
Bes . Go on , brave Sergius .
It doth strike my Soul ,
( And who can scape the stroke , that hath a Soul ,
Or but the smallest Air of Man within him ? )
To see them swell with Treasure , which they pour
Out i' their Riots , eating , drinking , building ,
I , i' the Sea ! plaining of Hills with Valleys ,
And raising Valleys above Hills ; Whilst we
Have not to give our Bodies Necessaries .
They ha' their change of Houses , Mannors , Lordships ;
VVe scarce a Fire , or a poor Houshold Lar !
They buy rare Attick Statues , Tyrian Hangings ,
Ephesian Pictures , and Corinthian Plate ,
Attalick Garments , and now new-found Gems ,
Since Pompey went for Asia , which they purchase
At price of Provinces ! The River Phasis
Cannot afford 'em Fowl , nor Lucrine Lake
Oysters enow : Circes too is search 'd ,
To please the witty Gluttony of a Meal !
Their ancient Habitations they neglect ,
And set up new ; then , if the Echo like not
In such a Room , they pluck down those , build newer ,
Alter them too ; and , by all frantick ways ,
Vex their wild VVealth , as they molest the People ,
From whom they force it ! Yet they cannot tame ,
Or overcome their Riches ! not by making
Here , and then there forcing 'em out again ,
VVith mountainous Heaps , for which the Earth hath lost
Most of her Ribs , as Entrails ; being now
VVounded no less for Marble , than for Gold !
VVe , all this while , like calm , benumb 'd Spectators ,
Sit till our Seats do crack , and do not hear
The thundring Ruins ; whilst at home our wants ,
Abroad our Debts do urge us ; our States daily
Bending to bad , our Hopes to worse ; and what
Is left , but to be crush 'd ? VVake , wake , brave Friends ,
And meet the Liberty you oft have wish 'd for .
Fortune holds out these to you , as Rewards .
Me thinks ( though I were dumb ) th ' Affair it self ,
The Opportunity , your Needs , and Dangers ,
VVith the brave Spoil the VVar brings , should invite you .
Use me your General , or Soldier ; neither
My Mind nor Body shall be wanting to you :
And , being Consul , I not doubt t ' effect
All that you wish , if trust not flatter me ,
And you 'd not rather still be Slaves , than Free .
Free , free .
' Tis Freedom . Cur . Fredom we all stand for .
VVhy , these are noble Voices ! Nothing wants then ,
But that we take a solemn Sacrament ,
To strengthen our Design . Cet . And so to act it .
Deferring hurts , where Powers are so prepar 'd .
Yet , e 're we enter into open act ,
( With favour ) 'twere no loss , if't might be inquir 'd ,
What the Condition of these Arms would be .
I , and the Means to carry us through ?
How , Friends !
Think you that I would bid you grasp the Wind ,
Or call you to th ' embracing of a Cloud ?
Put your known Valors on so dear a Business ,
And have no other Second than the Danger ,
Nor other Garland than the Loss ? Become
Your own Assurances . And for the Means ,
The Commonwealth is in now ; the whole Senate
Sleepy , and dreaming no such violent Blow ;
Their Forces all abroad ; of which the greatest ,
That might annoy us most , is farthest off ,
In Asia , under Pompey ; those near hand ,
Commanded by our Friends ; one Army ' in Spain ,
By Cneus Piso ; th ' other in Mauritania ,
By Nucerinus ; both which I have firm ,
And fast unto our Plot . My self then standing
Now to be Consul , with my hop 'd Colleague
Caius Antonius , one no less engag 'd
By 's wants , than we ; and whom I 've power to melt ,
And cast in any Mould . Beside , some others ,
That will not yet be nam 'd , ( both sure , and great ones )
Who , when the time comes , shall declare themselves
Strong for our Party ; so that no Resistance
In Nature can be thought . For our Reward then ,
First , all our Debts are paid ; dangers of Law ,
The Rich men , as in Sylla 's times , proscrib 'd ,
And Publication made of all their Goods :
That House is yours ; that Land is his ; those Waters ,
Orchards , and Walks , a third 's ; he has that Honour ,
And he that Office : Such a Province falls
To Vargunteius ; this t ' Autronius ; that
To bold Cethegus ; Rome to Lentulus .
You share the World , her Magistracies , Priesthoods ,
Wealth , and Felicity , amongst you , Friends ;
Revenge the Contumely stuck upon you ,
In being removed from the Senate ? Now ,
Now is your time . Would Publius Lentulus
Strike , for the like Disgrace ? Now is his time .
Would stout Longinus walk the Streets of Rome ,
Facing the Pr?tor ? Now has he a time
To spurn and tread the Fasces into Dirt ,
Made of the Usurers and the Lictors Brains .
Is there a Beauty , here in Rome , you love ?
An Enemy you would kill ? What Head 's not yours ?
Whose Wife , which Boy , whose Daughter , of what Race ,
That th ' Husband or glad Parents shall not bring you ,
And boasting of the Office ? Only spare
Your selves , and you have all the Earth beside ,
A Field to exercise your Longings in .
I see you rais 'd , and read your forward Minds
High , in your Faces . Bring the Wine and Blood
You have prepar 'd there . Lon . How !
I have kill 'd a Slave ,
And of his Blood caus 'd to be mixt with Wine .
Fill every Man his Bowl . There cannot be
A fitter Drink to make this Sanction in .
Here , I begin the Sacrament to all .
O for a Clap of Thunder now , as loud
As to be heard throughout the Universe ,
To tell the World the Fact , and to applaud it .
Be firm , my Hand ; not shed a drop , but pour
Fierceness into me with it , and fell Thirst
Of more and more , till Rome be lest as Bloodless
As ever her Fears made her , or the Sword .
And when I leave to wish this to thee , Step-dame ,
Or stop t ' effect it , with my Powers fainting ,
So may my Blood be drawn , and so drunk up ,
As is this Slaves . Lon . And so be mine . Len . And mine .
And mine . Var . And mine .
Swell me my Bowl yet fuller .
Here , I do drink this , as I would do Cato 's ,
Or the new Fellow Cicero 's , with that Vow
And I. Bes . And I. Ful . And I. Gab . And all of us .
Why , now 's the business safe , & each man strengthned .
not answer ?
Sirrah , what ail you ?
Nothing . Bes . Somewhat modest .
Slave , I will strike your Soul out with my Foot ,
Let me but find you again with such a Face :
You Whelp ? Bes . Nay , Lucius . Cat . Are you coying it ,
When I command you to be free , and general
To all ? Bes . You 'll be observ 'd . Cat . Arise , and shew
But any least aversion i' your Look
To him that boards you next , and your Throat opens .
Noble Confederates , thus far is perfect .
Only your Suffrages I will expect
At the Assembly for the chusing Consuls ,
And all the Voices you can make by Friends
To my Election . Then let me work out
Your Fortunes , and mine own . Mean while , all rest
Seal 'd
Seal 'd up , and silent , as when rigid Frosts
Have bound up Brooks and Rivers , forc 'd wild Beasts
Unto their Caves , and Birds into the Woods ,
Clowns to their Houses , and the Country sleeps ;
That when the sudden Thaw comes , we may break
Upon 'em lik a Deluge , bearing down
Half Rome before us , and invade the rest
With Cries , and Noise , able to wake the Urns
Of those are dead , and make their Ashes fear .
The Horrors that do strike the World , should come
Loud , and unlook 'd for ; till they strike , be dumb .
CAn nothing Great , and at the height ,
Remain so long ? but its own Weight
Will ruin it ? or , is't blind Chance ,
That still desires new States t ' advance ,
And quit the old ? Else why must Rome
Be by it self now overcome ?
Hath she not Foes enow of those
Whom she hath made such , and enclose
Her round about ? Or , are they none ,
Except she first become her own ?
O wretchedness of greatest States ,
To be obnoxious to these Fates !
That cannot keep what they do gain ;
And what they raise , so ill sustain !
Rome now is Mistris of the whole
World , Sea and Land , to either Pole ;
And even that Fortune will destroy
The Power that made it : She doth joy
So much in Plenty , Wealth , and Ease ,
As now th ' Excess is her Disease .
She builds in Gold , and to the Stars ,
As if she threatned Heav'n with Wars ;
And seeks for Hell in Quarries deep ,
Giving the Fiends , that there do keep ,
A hope of Day . Her Women wear
The Spoils of Nations in an Ear ,
Chang 'd for the Treasure of a Shell ;
And in their loose Attires do swell ,
More light than Sails , when all Winds play :
Yet are the Men more loose than they !
More kemb 'd , and bath 'd , and rubb 'd , and trimm 'd ,
More sleek , more soft , and slacker Limb 'd ;
As prostitute ; so much , that Kind
May seek it self there , and not find .
They eat on Beds of Silk and Gold ,
At Ivory Tables , or Wood sold
Dearer than it ; and leaving Plate ,
Do drink in Stone of higher Rate .
They hunt all Grounds , and draw all Seas ,
Foul every Brook and Bush , to please
Their wanton Taste ; and in request
Have new and rare things , not the best .
Hence comes that wild and vast Expence ,
That hath enforc 'd Romes Vertue thence ,
Which simple Poverty first made :
And now Ambition doth invade
Her State , with eating Avarice ,
Riot , and every other Vice .
Decrees are bought , and Laws are sold ,
Honours , and Offices , for Gold ;
The Peoples Voices , and the free
Tongues in the Senate , bribed be .
Such ruin of her Manners , Rome
Doth suffer now , as she 's become
( Without the Gods it soon gainsay )
Both her own Spoiler , and own Prey .
With us , for all the Blows thee given ;
When we , whose Vertue conquer 'd thee ,
Thus , by thy Vices , ruin 'd be .
THose Rooms do smell extreamly . Bring my Glass
And Table hither . Galla . Gal . Madam . Ful . Look
Within , i' my blue Cabinet , for the Pearl
I 'had sent me last , and bring it . Gal . That from Clodius ?
From Caius C?sar . Yo ' are for Clodius still ,
Or Curius . Sirrah , if Quintus Curius come ,
I am not in fit mood ; I keep my Chamber :
Give warning so without . Gal . Is this it , Madam ?
Yes , help to hang it in mine Ear . Gal . Believe me ,
It is a rich one , Madam . Ful . I hope so :
It should not be worn there else . Make an end ,
And bind my Hair up . Gal . As 'twas yesterday ?
No, nor the t 'other day . When knew you me
Appear two days together in one Dressing ?
Will you ha't i' the Globe , or Spire ?
How thou wilt ;
Any way , so thou wilt do it , good Impertinence .
Thy Company , if I slept not very well
A nights , would make me an errant Fool , with Questions .
Alas , Madam ? ?
Nay , gentle half o ' the Dialogue , cease .
I do it indeed but for your Exercise ,
As your Physician bids me . Ful . How ! does he bid you
To anger me for Exercise ? Gal . Not to anger you ,
But stir your Blood a little : There 's difference
Between Luke-warm and Boiling , Madam . Ful . Jove !
She means to cook me , I think . Pray you , ha' done .
I mean to dress you , Madam . Ful . O , my Juno ,
Be Friend to me ! Off'ring at Wit too ? Why , Galla !
Where hast thou been ?
Why , Madam ? Ful . What hast thou done
With thy poor innocent self ?
Wherefore , sweet Madam ?
Thus to come forth , so suddenly , a Wit-worm ?
It pleases you to flout one . I did dream
Of Lady Sempronia ? Ful . O , the wonder is out .
That did infect thee ? Well , and how ? Gal . Methought
She did discourse the best ? Ful . That ever thou heard 'st ?
Yes . Ful . I ' thy Sleep ? Of what was her Discourse ?
O' the Republick , Madam , and the State ,
And how she was in debt , and where she meant
To raise fresh Sums : She 's a great States-woman !
Thou dream 'st all this ?
No, but you know she is , Madam ;
And both a Mistris of the Latin Tongue ,
And of the Greek . Ful . I , but I never dreamt it , Galla ,
As thou hast done ; and therefore you must pardon me .
Indeed you mock me , Madam . Ful . Indeed , no .
Forth with your learned Lady . She has a Wit too ?
A very masculine one . Ful . A She-Critick , Galla ?
And can compose in Verse , and make quick Jests ,
Modest , or otherwise ?
Yes , Madam . Ful . She can sing too ?
And play on Instruments ? Gal . Of all kinds , they say .
And doth dance rarely ? Gal . Excellent ! So well ,
As a bald Senator made a Jest , and said ,
' Twas better than an honest Woman need .
Tut , she may bear that . Few wise womens honesties
Will do their courtship hurt . Gal . She 's liberal too , Madam .
What ! of her Money , or her Honour , pr'y thee ?
Of both ; you know not which she doth spare least .
A comely Commendation . Gal . Troth , 'tis pity
She is in years . Ful . Why , Galla ? Gal . For it is .
O , is that all ? I thought th ' hadst had a Reason .
Why , so I have . She has been a fine Lady ,
And yet she dresses her self ( except you , Madam )
One o ' the best in Rome ; and paints , and hides
Her Decays very well . Ful . They say , it is
Rather a Visor , than a Face , she wears .
They wrong her verily , Madam ; she does sleek
With Crums of Bread and Milk , and lies a-nights
In as neat Gloves ? But she is fain of late
To seek , more than she 's sought to , ( the fame is )
And so spends that way . Ful . Thou know 'st all ! But Galla ,
There is the Gallant ! Gal . She does well . She has
Very good Sutes , and very rich ; but then
She cannot put 'em on ; she knows not how
To wear a Garment . You shall have her all
Jewels and Gold sometimes , so that her self
Appears the least part of her self . No in troth ,
As I live , Madam , you put 'em all down
With your meer strength of Judgment , and do draw too
The World of Rome to follow ! You attire
Your self so diversly , and with that spirit !
Still to the noblest Humours ! They could make
Love to your Dress , altho ' your Face were away , they say .
And Body too , and ha' the better Match on't .
Say they not so too , Galla ? Now ! What News
Travels your Count 'nance with ? Ser . If't please you , Madam ,
The Lady Sempronia is lighted at the Gate .
Castor , my Dream , my Dream .
And comes to see you .
For Venus sake , good Madam , see her . Ful . Peace ,
The Fool is wild , I think . Gal . And hear her talk ,
Sweet Madam , of State-matters , and the Senate .
FUlvia , good Wench , how dost thou ?
Well , Sempronia .
Whither are you thus early addrest ? Sem . To see
Aurelia Orestilla . She sent for me .
I came to call thee with me ; wilt thou go ?
I cannot now , in troth ; I have some Letters
To write , and send away . Sem . Alas , I pity thee .
I ha' been writing all this night ( and am
So very weary ) unto all the Tribes ,
In his Election . We shall make him Consul ,
I hope , amongst us . Crassus , I , and C?sar
Will carry it for him . Ful . Does he stand for't ?
He 's the chief Candidate . Ful . Who stands beside ?
( Give me some Wine , and Powder for my Teeth .
Here 's a good Pearl , in troth . Ful . A pretty one .
A very Orient one ! ) There are Competitors ,
Caius Antonius , Publius Galba , Lucius
Cassius Longinus , Quintus Cornificius ,
Caius Licinius , and that Talker Cicero .
For four o ' the other , Licinius , Longinus ,
Galba , and Cornificius , will give way :
And Cicero they will not chuse . Ful . No ? why ?
It will be cross 'd by the Nobility .
( How she does understand the Common Business ! )
Nor were it fit . He is but a new Fellow ,
And the Patricians should do very ill
To let the Consulship be so defil 'd
As't would be , if he obtain 'd it ! A meer Upstart ,
That has no Pedigree , no House , no Coat ,
No Ensigns of a Family ! Ful . He has Vertue .
Hang Vertue , where there is no Blood ; 'tis Vice ,
And in him Sawciness , Why should he presume
To be more Learned , or more Eloquent ,
Than the Nobility ? or boast any Quality
Worthy a Nobleman , himself not Noble ?
' Twas Vertue only , at first , made all Men Noble .
I yield you , it might at first , in Rome 's poor age ,
When both her Kings and Consuls held the Plow ,
Or Garden 'd well : But now we ha' no need
To dig , or lose our Sweat for't . We have Wealth ,
Fortune , and Ease ; and then their Stock to spend on ,
Of Name , for Vertue ; which will bear us out
' Gainst all new Comers , and can never fail us ,
While the Succession stays . And we must glorifie
A Mushrom ? one of yesterday ? a fine Speaker ?
' Cause he has suckt at Athens ? and advance him ,
To our own loss . No, Fulvia ; there are they
Can speak Greek too , if need were . C?sar and I
Have sate upon him ; so hath Crassus too ,
And others . We have all decreed his Rest ,
For rising farther . Gal . Excellent rare Lady !
Sempronia , you are beholden to my Woman here ;
She does admire you . Sem . O good Galla , how dost thou ?
The better for your learned Ladiship .
Is this gray Powder a good Dentifrice ?
You see I use it . Sem . I have one is whiter .
I may be so .
Yet this smells well . Gal . And cleanses
Very well , Madam , and resists the Crudities .
Fulvia , I pray thee , who comes to thee now ?
Which of our great Patricians ? Ful . Faith , I keep
No Catalogue of 'em . Sometimes I have one ,
Sometimes another , as the Toy takes their Bloods .
Thou hast them all . Faith , when was Quintus Curius ,
Thy special Servant , here ? Ful . My special Servant ?
Yes , thy Idolater , I call him . Ful . He may be yours ,
If you do like him . Sem . How ! Ful . He comes not here ;
I have forbid him hence . Sem . Venus forbid !
Why ? Sem . Your so constant Lover .
So much the rather .
I would have Change . So would you too , I am sure .
And now you may have him . Sem . He 's fresh yet , Fulvia .
Beware how you do tempt me . Ful . Faith , for me
He 's somewhat too fresh indeed ; the Salt is gone ,
That gave him season . His good Gifts are done .
He does not yield the Crop that he was wont .
With Backs worth ten of him , and shall please me
( Now that the Land is fled ) a Myriad better .
And those one may command .
' Tis true : these Lordlings ,
Your Noble Faunes , they are so imperious , saucie ,
Rude , and as boisterous as Centaurs , leaping
A Lady at first sight . Sem . And must be born
Both with , and out , they think . Ful . Tut , I 'll observe
None of 'em all , nor humour 'em a jot
Longer than they come laden in the Hand ,
And say , Here 's t 'one for th'other .
Does C?sar give well ?
They shall all give , and pay well , that come here ,
If they will have it ; and that Jewels , Pearl ,
Plate , or round Sums , to buy these . I 'm not taken
Whith a Cob-Swan , or a high-mounting Bull ,
As foolish Leda and Europa were ;
But the bright Gold , with Danae . For such Price
I would endure a rough , harsh Jupiter ,
Or ten such thundring Gamesters , and refrain
To laugh at 'em , till they are gone , with my much suffering .
Th' art a most happy Wench , that thus canst make
Use of thy Youth and Freshness , in the Season ;
And hast it to make use of . Ful . ( Which is the happiness . )
I am now fain to give to them , and keep
Musick , and a continual Table , to invite 'em .
( Yes , and they study your Kitchen , more than you . )
Eat my self out with Usury , and my Lord too ,
And all my Officers , and Friends beside ,
To procure Moneys for the needful Charge
I must be at , to have 'em ; and yet scarce
Can I atchieve 'em so . Ful . Why , that 's because
You affect young Faces only , and smooth Chins ,
If you 'ld love Beards and Bristles ,
( One with another , as others do ) or Wrinkles ? ?
Who 's that ? Look , Galla . Gal . ' Tis the Party , Madam .
What Party ? Has he no name ?
' Tis Quintus Curius .
Did
Did I not bid 'em say I kept my Chamber ?
Why , so they do . Sem . I 'll leave you , Fulvia .
Nay , good Sempronia , stay .
In faith , I will not .
By Juno I would not see him .
I 'll not hinder you .
You know , he will not be kept out , Madam .
No,
Nor shall not , careful Galla , by my means .
As I do live , Sempronia ?
What needs this ?
Go , say I am a-sleep , and ill at ease .
By Castor , no , I 'll tell him , you are awake ;
And very well . Stay Galla ; farewell Fulvia :
I know my manners . Why do you labour thus ,
With action , against purpose ? Quintus Curius ,
She is , i'faith , here , and in disposition .
Spight with your courtesie ! How shall I be tor-
tur 'd !
WHere are you , fair one , that conceal your self ,
And keep your Beauty within Locks and Bars here ,
Like a Fools Treasure ?
True , she was a Fool ,
When first she shew 'd it to a Thief .
How , pretty sullenness !
So harsh and short ? Ful . The Fools Artillery , Sir .
Then take my Gown off , for th ' encounter .
Stay Sir .
I am not in the mood . Cur . I 'll put you into't .
Best put your self i' your case again , and keep
Your furious Appetite warm , against you have place for't .
What ! do you coy it ?
No Sir . I'am not proud .
I would you were . You think this state becomes
you ?
By Hercules , it do 's not . Look i' your Glass now ,
And see how scurvily that countenance shews ;
You would be loth to own it . Ful . I shall not change it .
Faith but you must , and slack this bended Brow ;
And shoot less scorn : there is a Fortune coming
Towards you , Dainty , that will take thee thus ,
And set thee aloft , to tread upon the Head
Of her own Statue here in Rome . Ful . I wonder ,
Who let this promiser in ! Did you , good Diligence ?
Give him his Bribe again . Or if you had none ,
Pray you demand him , why he is so venturous ,
To press thus to my Chamber , being forbidden ,
Both by my self and Servants ?
How ! This 's handsome !
And somewhat a new strain !
' Tis not strain 'd , Sir .
' Tis very natural . Cur . I have known it otherwise ,
Between the Parties , though .
For your fore-knowledge ,
Thank that which made it . It will not be so
Hereafter , I assure you . Cur . No, my Mistris ?
No, though you bring the same materials .
Hear me ,
You over-act when you should under-do .
A little call your self again , and think .
If you do this to practise on me ' or find
At what forc 'd distance you can hold your Servant ;
That ' it be an artificial trick to enflame ,
And fire me more , fearing my Love may need it ,
As heretofore you ha' done : why , proceed .
As I ha' done heretofore ?
Yes , when you 'ld fain
Your Husbands jealousie , your Servants watches ,
Speak softly , and run often to the Door ,
Or to the Window , form strange fears that were not ;
As if the pleasure were less acceptable ,
That were secure . Ful . You are an impudent Fellow .
And when you might better have done it at the
Gate ,
To take me in at the Casement . Ful . I take you in ?
Yes , you my Lady . And then , being a bed
with you ,
To have your well-taughr Waiter here , come running ,
And cry , her Lord , and hide me without cause ,
Crush 'd in a Chest , or thrust up in a Chimney .
When he , tame Crow , was winking at his Farm ;
Or , had he been here , and present , would have kept
Both Eyes , and Beak seal 'd up , for six Sesterces .
You have a slanderous , beastly , unwash 'd Tongue ,
I ' your rude Mouth , and favouring your self ,
Un-manner 'd Lord . Cur . How now !
It is your Title , Sir .
Who ( since you ha' lost your own good Name , and
know not
What to lose more ) care not whose Honour you wound ,
Or Fame you poyson with it . You should go
And vent your self i' the Region where you live ,
Among the Suburb-brothels , Bawds , and Brokers ,
Whither your broken Fortunes have design 'd you .
Nay , then I must stop your fury , I see ; and
pluck
The Tragick Visor off . Come , Lady Cypris ,
Know your own Vertues , quickly . I 'll not be
Put to the wooing of you thus , a-fresh ,
At every turn , for all the Venus in you .
Yield , and be pliant , or by Pollux ? ? How now ?
Will Lais turn a Lucrece ? Ful . No, but by Castor ,
Hold off your Ravishers Hands , I pierce your Heart else .
I 'll not be put to kill my self , as she did ,
For you , sweet Tarquin . What ? do you fall off ?
Nay , it becomes you graciously ! Put not up .
You 'll sooner draw your Weapon on me , I think it ,
Than on the Senate , who have cast you forth
Disgracefully , to be the common Tale
Of the whole City ; base , infamous Man !
For , were you other , you would there imploy
Your desperate Dagger . Cur . Fulvia , you do know
The strengths you have upon me ; do not use
Your power too like a Tyrant : I can bear
Almost until you break me . Ful . I do know , Sir ,
So do 's the Senate too , know you can bear .
By all the Gods , the Senate will smart deep
For your upbraidings . I should be right sorry
To have the means so to be veng 'd on you ,
( At least , the will ) as I shall shortly on them .
But , go you on still ; fare you well , dear Lady :
You could not still be fair , unless you were proud .
You will repent these moods , and ere 't be long too .
I shall ha' you come about again .
Do you think so ?
Yes , and I know so . Ful . By what Augury ?
By the fair Entrails of the Matrons Chests ,
Will then ( but late ) say that she might have shar 'd :
And grieving miss .
Tut , all your promis 'd Mountains ,
And Seas , I am so stalely acquainted with ? ?
But , when you see the universal Flood
Run by your Coffers ; that my Lords , the Senators ,
Are sold for Slaves , their Wives for Bond-women ,
Their Houses and fine Gardens given away ,
And all their Goods , under the Spear at out-cry ,
And you have none of this ; but are still Fulvia ,
Or perhaps less , while you are thinking of it :
You will advise then , Coiness , with your Cushion ,
And look o ' your Fingers ; say , how you were wish 'd ;
And so he left you . Ful . Call him again , Galla :
This is not usual ! something hangs on this
That I must win out of him . Cur . How now , melt you ?
Come ,
Come , you will laugh now , at my easiness !
But 'tis no miracle : Doves , they say , will bill ,
After their pecking and their murmuring . Cur . Yes ,
And then 'tis kindly . I would have my Love
Angry sometimes , to sweeten off the rest
Of her behaviour . Ful . You do see , I study
How I may please you then . But you think , Curius ,
' Tis covetise hath wrought me : if you love me ,
Change that unkind conceit . Cur . By my lov 'd Soul ,
I love thee , like to it ; and 'tis my study ,
More than mine own revenge , to make thee happy .
And 'tis that just revenge doth make me happy
To hear you prosecute : and which , indeed ,
Hath won me to you , more than all the hope
Of what can else be promis 'd . I love Valour
Better than any Lady loves her Face ,
Or dressing , than my self do 's , Let me grow
Still , where I do embrace . But what good means
Ha' you t ' effect it ? Shall I know your Project ?
Thou shalt , if thou'lt be gracious .
As I can be .
And wilt thou kiss me then ? Ful . As close as Shells
Of Cockles meet . Cur . And print 'em deep ?
Quite through
Our subtle Lips . Cur . And often ? Ful . I will sow 'em
Faster than you can reap . What is your Plot ?
Why , now my Fulvia looks like her bright name !
And is her self ! Ful . Nay , answer me , your Plot ;
I pr'y thee tell me , Quintus . Cur . I , these Sounds
Become a Mistris . Here is Harmony !
When you are harsh , I see the way to bend you
Is not with violence , but service . Cruel ,
A Lady is a fire : gentle , a light .
Will you not tell me , what I ask you ? Cur . All
That I can think , sweet Love , or my Breast holds ,
I 'll pour into thee . Ful . What is your design then ?
But you will hear more shortly .
Nay , dear love ? ?
I 'll speak it in thine Arms , let us go in .
Rome will be sack 'd , her Wealth will be our prize ;
By publick ruine , private Spirits must rise .
GReat Father Mars , and greater Jove ,
By whose high auspice , Rome hath stood
So long ; and first was built in Blood
Of your great Nephew , that then strove
Not with his Brother , but your rites :
Be present to her now , as then ,
And let not proud and factious Men
Against your wills oppose their mights .
Our Consuls , now are to be made ;
O , put it in the publick voice
To make a free and worthy choice :
Excluding such as would invade
The Commonwealth . Let whom we name ,
Have wisdom , fore-sight , fortitude ,
Be more with Faith than Face endu 'd ,
And study Conscience , above Fame .
Such , as not seek to get the start
In State , by Power , Parts , or Bribes ,
Ambitions Bawds : but move the Tribes
By Vertue , Modesty , Desert .
Such , as to Justice will adhere ,
What ever great one it offend :
And from the embraced truth not bend
For envy , hatred , gifts , or fear .
That by their deeds will make it known ,
Whose Dignity they do sustain ;
And Life , State , Glory , all they gain ,
Count the Republicks , not their own .
Such the old Bruti , Decii were ,
The Cipi , Curtii , who did give
Themselves for Rome : and would not live
As Men , good only for a year .
Such were the great Camilli , too ;
The Fabii , Scipio 's ; that still thought
No work at price enough was bought ,
That for their Country they could do .
And to her honour , so did knit ;
As all their acts were understood
The Sinews of the publick good :
And they themselves , one Soul , with it .
These Men were truly Magistrates ;
These neither practis 'd force , nor forms ;
Nor did they leave the Helm in storms !
And such they are make happy States .

GReat Honours are great burdens : but , on whom
They 'are cast with envy , he doth bear two loads .
His cares must still be double to his joys ,
In any Dignity ; where , if he err ,
He finds no pardon : and for doing well
A most small praise , and that wrung out by force .
I speak this , Romans , knowing what the weight
Of the high charge , you ' have trusted to me , is .
Not that thereby I would with art decline
The good , or greatness of your benefit ;
For , I ascribe it to your singular grace ,
And vow to owe it to no title else ,
Except the Gods , that Cicero is your Consul .
I have no Urns ; no dusty Monuments ;
No broken Images of Ancestors ,
Wanting an Ear , or Nose ; no forged Tables
Of long descents , to boast false honours from :
Or be my undertakers to your trust .
But a new Man ( as I am stil 'd in Rome )
Whom you have dignified ; and more , in whom
Yo ' have cut a way , and left it ope for vertue
Hereafter , to that place : which our great Men
Held shut up , with all ramparts , for themselves .
Nor have but few of them , in time been made
Your Consuls , so ; new Men , before me , none :
At my first suit ; in my just year ; prefer 'd
To all competitors ; and some the noblest ?
Now the vein swels . C?s . Up glory .
And to have
Your loud consents , from your own utter 'd Voices ;
Not silent Books : nor from the meaner Tribes ,
But first and last , the universal concourse !
This is my joy , my gladness . But my care ,
My industry and vigilance now must work ,
That still your Counsels of me be approv 'd ,
Both by your selves , and those to whom you have
With grudge prefer 'd me : two things I must labour ,
That neither they upbraid , nor you repent you .
For every lapse of mine will now be call 'd
Your error , if I make such . But , my hope is ,
So to bear through , and out , the Consulship ,
As spight shall ne 'er wound you , though it may me .
And for my self , I have prepar 'd this strength ,
To do so well ; as , if there happen ill
Unto me , it shall make the Gods to blush :
And be their crime , not mine , that I am envi 'd .
O confidence ! more new than is the Man !
I know well , in what terms I do receive
The Commonwealth , how vexed , how preplex 'd :
In which there 's not that mischief , or ill fate ,
That
That good Men fear not , wicked Men expect not .
I know , beside some turbulent practises
Already on foot , and rumors of more dangers ?
Or you will make them , if there be none .
Last ,
I know , 'twas this , which made the envy and pride
Of the great Roman Blood bate , and give way
To my Election . Cat . Marcus Tullius , true ;
Our need made thee our Consul , and thy vertue .
Cato , you will undo him with your praise ?
C?sar will hurt himself with his own envy .
The Voice of Cato is the Voice of Rome .
The Voice of Rome is the Consent of Heaven !
And that hath plac 'd thee , Cicero , at the Helm ,
Where thou must render now thy self a Man ,
And Master of thy Art . Each petty hand
Can steer a Ship becalm 'd ; but he that will
Govern , and carry her to her ends , must know
His Tides , his Currents ; how to shift his Sails ;
What she will bear in foul , what in fair Weathers ;
Where her Springs are , her Leaks ; and how to stop 'em ;
What Stands , what Shelves , what Rocks do threaten her ;
The forces , and the natures of all Winds ,
And Deck knocks Heaven : then to manage her ,
Becomes the name and office of a Pilot .
Which I 'll perform , with all the diligence
And fortitude I have ; not for my year ,
But for my life ; except my life be less ,
And that my year conclude it : if it must ,
Your Will , lov 'd Gods . This Heart shall yet employ
A day , an hour is left me , so for Rome ,
As it shall spring a life out of my death ,
To shine for ever glorious in my facts .
The vicious count their years , vertuous their acts .
Most noble Consul ! Let us wait him home .
Most popular Consul he is grown , methinks !
How the rout cling to him !
And Cato leads 'em !
You , his collegue Antonius , are not lookt on .
Not I , nor do I care . C?s . He enjoys rest ,
And ease the while . Let th ' others Spirit toil ,
And wake it out , that was inspir 'd for turmoil .
If all reports be true , yet Caius C?sar ,
The time hath need of such a Watch and Spirit .
Reports ? Do you believe 'em Catulus ?
Why he does make , and breed 'em for the People ;
T' endear his service to 'em . Do you not taste
An Art that is so common ? Popular Men ,
They must create strange monsters , and then quell 'em ,
To make their Arts seem something . Would you have
Such an Herculean actor in the Scene ,
And not his Hydra ? They must sweat no less
To fit their properties , than t 'express their parts .
Treasons , and guilty Men are made in States
Too oft , to dignifie the Magistrates .
Those States be wretched that are forc 'd to buy
Their Rulers fame with their own infamy .
We therefore should provide that ours do not .
That will Antonius make his care .
I shall .
And watch the watcher .
How does he brook his late repulse ?
I know not ,
But hardly sure . Cat . Longinus too did stand ?
At first : but he gave way unto his Friend .
Who 's that come ? Lentulus ?
Yes ; he is again
Taken into the Senate . Ant . And made Pr?tor .
I know't . He had my suffrage , next the Consuls .
True , you were there , Prince of the Senate , then .

HAil noblest Romans . The most worthy Consul ,
I gratulate your Honour . Ant . I could wish
It had been happier , by your fellowship ,
Most noble Sergius , had it pleas 'd the People .
It did not please the Gods , who instruct the
People :
And their unquestion 'd pleasures must be serv 'd .
They know what 's fitter for us than our selves ;
And 'twere Impiety to think against them .
You bear it rightly , Lucius ; and it glads me ,
To find your thoughts so even . Cati . I shall still
Study to make them such to Rome , and Heaven .
( I would withdraw with you a little , Julius .
I 'll come home to you : Crassus would not ha' you
To speak to him , 'fore Quintus Catullus .
I apprehend you . ) No, when they shall judge
Honours convenient for me , I shall have 'em ,
With a full hand : I know it . In mean time ,
They are no less part of the Commonwealth ,
That do obey , than those that do command .
O let me kiss your Fore-head , Lucius .
How are you wrong 'd ! Cati . By whom ?
Publick report .
That gives you out , to stomach your repulse ;
And brook it deadly . Cati . Sir , she brooks not me .
Believe me rather , and your self , now of me :
It is a kind of slander to trust rumour .
I know it . And I could be angry with it .
So may not I. Where it concerns himself ,
Who 's angry at a slander , makes it true .
Most noble Sergius ! This your temper melts me .
Will you do office to the Consul , Quintus ?
Which Cato , and the rout have done the other ?
I wait , when he will go . Be still your self .
He wants no state , or honours , that hath vertue .
Did I appear so tame , as this Man thinks me ?
Look 'd I so poor ? so dead ? so like that nothing ,
Which he calls vertuous ? O my Breast , break quickly ;
And shew my Friends my in-parts , lest they think
I have betraid 'em . ( Lon . Where 's Gabinius ?
Gone .
And Vargunteius ?
Slipt away ; all shrunk :
Now that he mist the Consulship . ) Cati . I am
The scorn of Bond-men , who are next to Beasts .
What can I worse pronounce my self , that 's fitter ?
The Owle of Rome , whom Boys and Girls will hout !
That were I set up , for that woodden God ,
That keeps our Gardens , could not fright the Crows ,
Or the least Bird from muting on my Head .
' Tis strange how he should miss it .
Is't not stranger ,
The up-start Cicero should carry it so ,
By all consents , from Men so much his Masters ?
' Tis true . )
To what a shadow am I melted !
Antonius wan it but by some few Voices . )
Struck through , like Air , and feel it not . My
wounds
Close faster , than they 'r made . ( Len . The whole design ,
And enterprise is lost by 't . All Hands quit it ,
Upon his fail . ) Cati . I grow mad at my patience .
It is a Visor that hath poison 'd me .
Would it had burnt me up , and I died inward :
My heart first turn 'd to ashes . ( Lon . Here 's Cethegus yet . )
REpulse upon repulse ? An in-mate Consul ?
That I could reach the Axel , where the Pins are ,
Which bolt this Frame ; that I might pull 'em out ,
And pluck all into Chaos , with my self .
What , are we wishing now ?
Yes , my Cethegus .
Who would not fall with all the World about him ?
Not I , that would stand on it , when it falls ;
And force new nature out to make another .
These wishings taste of Woman , not of Roman .
Let us seek other Arms . Cati . What should we do ?
Do , and not wish ; something that wishes take not :
So sudden , as the Gods should not prevent ,
Nor scarce have time to fear . Cati . O noble Caius !
It likes me better , that you are not Consul .
I would not go through open Doors , but break 'em ;
Swim to my ends through Blood ; or build a Bridge
Of Carcasses ; make on , upon the heads
Of Men , struck down like Piles ; to reach the lives
Of those remain and stand : Then is't a prey ,
When danger stops , and ruine makes the way .
How thou dost utter me , brave Soul , that may not
At all times shew such as I am , but bend
Upon occasion ? Lentulus , this Man ,
If all our fire were out , would fetch down new ,
Out of the hand of Jove ; and rivet him
To Caucasus , should he but frown : and let
His own gaunt Eagle fly at him , to tire .
Peace , here comes Cato .
Let him come , and hear .
I will no more dissemble . Quit us all ;
I , and my lov 'd Cethegus here , alone
Will undertake this Giants War , and carry it .
What needs this , Lucius ?
Sergius , be more wary .
Now , Marcus Cato , our new Consuls Spie ,
What is your sowre austerity sent t ' explore ?
Halters and Racks cannot express from thee
More than thy deeds . ' Tis only judgment waits thee .
Whose ? Cato 's ? shall he judge me ?
No, the Gods ;
Who ever follow those , they go not with :
And Senate , who with fire , must purge sick Rome
Of noisome Citizens , whereof thou 'art one .
Be gone , or else let me . ' Tis bane to draw
The same Air with thee . Cet . Strike him .
Hold , good Caius .
Fear 'st thou not , Cato ? Cato . Rash Cethegus , no .
Do threat , if Cato fear 'd . Cati . The fire you speak of ,
If any flames of it approach my Fortunes ,
I 'll quench it not with water , but with ruine .
You hear this , Romans .
Bear it to the Consul .
I would have sent away his Soul before him .
You are too heavy , Lentulus , and remiss ;
It is for you we labour , and the Kingdom
Promis 'd you by the Sybil 's .
Which his Pr?tor-ship ,
And some small flattery of the Senate more ,
Will make him to forget .
You wrong me , Lucius .
He will not need these Spurs .
The action needs 'em .
These things , when they proceed not , they go backward .
Let us consult then . Cet . Let us first take Arms .
They that deny us just things now , will give
All that we ask , if once they see our Swords .
Our objects must be sought with wounds , not

Cicero , Fulvia .
IS there a Heaven ? and Gods ? and can it be
They should so slowly hear , so slowly see !
Hath Jove no Thunder ? or is Jove become
Stupid as thou art ? O neer-wretched Rome ,
When both thy Senate , and thy Gods do sleep ,
And neither thine , nor their own States do keep !
What will awake thee , Heaven ? what can excite
Thine anger , if this practice be too light ?
His former drifts partake of former times ,
O , that it were his last . But he , before
Hath safely done so much , he 'll still dare more .
Ambition , like a torrent , ne 'er looks back ;
And is a swelling , and the last affection
A high mind can put off : being both a rebel
Unto the Soul , and Reason , and enforceth
All Laws , all Conscience , treads upon Religion ,
And offereth violence to Natures self .
But here is that transcends it ! A black purpose
To confound Nature : and to ruine that ,
Which never Age nor Mankind can repair !
Sit down , good Lady ; Cicero is lost
In this your Fable : for , to think it true
Tempteth my Reason . It so far exceeds
All insolent Fictions of the Tragick Scene !
The Commonwealth yet panting underneath
The stripes and wounds of a late civil War ,
Gasping for life , and scarce restor 'd to hope ;
To seek t 'oppress her with new cruelty ,
And utterly extinguish her long name ,
With so prodigious and unheard-of fierceness !
What sink of monsters , wretches of lost minds ,
Mad after change , and despeaate in their states ,
Wearied , and gall 'd with their necessities ,
( For all this I allow them ) durst have thought it ?
Would not the barbarous deeds have been believ 'd ,
Of Marius , and Sylla , by our Children ,
Without this fact had rise forth greater for them ?
All that they did , was Piety , to this !
They yet but murdred Kinsfolk , Brothers , Parents ,
Ravish 'd the Virgins , and perhaps , some Matrons ;
They left the City standing , and the Temples :
The Gods and Majesty of Rome were safe yet !
These purpose to fire it , to despoil them ,
( Beyond the other evils ) and lay waste
The far-triumphed World : for , unto whom
Rome is too little , what can be enough ?
' Tis true , my Lord , I had the same discourse .
And then , to take a horrid Sacrament
In human Blood , for execution
Of this their dire design ; which might be call 'd
The heighth of wickedness : but that , that was higher ,
For which they did it ! Ful . I assure your Lordship ,
The extreme horrour of it almost turn 'd me
To Air , when first I heard it ; I was all
A Vapour when 'twas told me : and I long 'd
To vent it any where . ' Twas such a secret ,
I thought it would have burnt me up .
Good Fulvia ,
Fear not your act ; and less repent you of it .
I do not , my good Lord . I know to whom
I have utter 'd it . Cic . You have discharg 'd it , safely .
Should Rome , for whom you have done the happy service ,
Turn most ingrate ; yet were your vertue paid
In conscience of the fact : so much good deeds
Reward themselves . Ful . My Lord , I did it not
To any other aim , but for it self .
To no ambition . Cic . You have learn 'd the difference
Of doing office to the publique Weal ,
And private friendship : and have shewn it , Lady .
Be still your self . I have sent for Quintus Curius ,
And
And ( for your vertuous sake ) if I can win him
Yet to the Common-wealth , he shall be safe too .
I 'll undertake , my Lord , he shall be won .
Pray you join with me then , and help to work him .
HOw now ? Is he come ?
He ' is here , my Lord . Cic . Go presently ,
Pray my Colleague Antonius I may speak with him ,
About some present Business of the State ;
And ( as you go ) call on my Brother Quintus ,
And pray him , with the Tribunes , to come to me .
Bid Curius enter . Fulvia , you will aid me ?
It is my Duty . Cic . O , my noble Lord !
I have to chide you , i' faith . Give me your Hand .
Nay , be not troubled ; 't shall be gently , Curius .
You look upon this Lady ? What ! do you guess
My Business yet ? Come , if you frown , I thunder :
Therefore put on your better Looks and Thoughts .
There 's nought but fair and good intended to you ;
And I would make those your Complexion .
Would you , of whom the Senate had that hope ,
As , on my knowledge , it was in their purpose
Next Sitting to restore you , as they done
The stupid and ungratful Lentulus ,
( Excuse me , that I name you thus together ,
For yet you are not such . ) Would you , I say ,
A Person both of Blood and Honour , stockt
In a long Race of vertuous Ancestors ,
With Parricides and Traitors , Men turn 'd Furies ,
Out of the Waste and Ruine of their Fortunes !
( For 'tis Despair that is the Mother of Madness . )
Such as want ( that which all Conspirators
But they have first ) meer Colour for their Mischief ?
O , I must blush with you . Come , you shall not labour
T' extenuate your Guilt , but quit it clean :
Bad Men excuse their Faults , good Men will leave 'em .
He acts the third Crime , that defends the first .
Here is a Lady that hath got the start
In Piety of us all , and for whose Vertue
I could almost turn Lover again , but that
Terentia would be jealous . What an Honour
Hath she atchieved to her self ! What Voices ,
Titles , and loud Applauses will pursue her
Through every Street ! What Windows will be fill 'd ,
To shoot Eyes at her ! What Envy and Grief in Matrons ,
Worthier a Chariot , than if Pompey came
With Asia chain 'd ! All this is , while she lives ;
But dead , her very Name will be a Statue !
Not wrought for Time , but rooted in the Minds
Of all Posterity ; when Brass and Marble ,
I , and the Capitol it self is Dust !
Your Honour thinks too highly of me . Cic . No ;
I cannot think enough ; and I would have
Him emulate you . ' Tis no shame to follow
The better Precedent . She shews you , Curius ,
What Claim your Country lays to you , and what Duty
You owe to it : Be not afraid to break
With Murderers , and Traitors , for the saving
A Life so near and necessary to you ,
As is your Countries . Think but on her Right .
No Child can be too natural to his Parent .
She is our Common Mother , and doth challenge
The prime part of us ; do not stop , but give it .
He that is void of Fear , may soon be just :
And no Religion binds Men to be Traitors .
My Lord , he understands it , and will follow
Your saving Counsel ; but his Shame yet stays him .
I know that he is coming . Cur . Do you know it ?
Yes , let me speak with you .
O , you are ? Ful . What am I ?
Speak not so loud .
I am what you should be .
Come , do you think I'ld walk in any Plot
Where Madam Sempronia should take place of me ,
And Fulvia come i' the Rere , or o ' the by ?
That I would be her Second , in a Business ,
Though it might vantage me all the Sun sees ?
It was a silly phant 'sie of yours . Apply
Your self to me , and the Consul , and be wise ;
Follow the Fortune I ha' put you into :
You may be something this way , and with safety .
Nay , I must tolerate no Whisperings , Lady .
Sir , you may hear . I tell him , in the way
Wherein he was , how hazardous his Course was .
How hazardous ? How certain to all ruin .
Did he , or do yet any of them imagine
The Gods would sleep , to such a Stygian Practice ,
Against that Commonwealth which they have founded
With so much Labour , and like Care have kept ,
Now neer seven hundred Years ? It is a Madness ,
Wherewith Heaven blinds 'em , when it would confound 'em ,
That they should think it . Come , my Curius ,
I see your Nature 's right ; you shall no more
Be mention 'd with them : I will call you mine ,
And trouble this good Shame no farther . Stand
Firm for your Country , and become a Man
Honour 'd and lov 'd . It were a noble Life ,
To be found dead , embracing her . Know you
What Thanks , what Titles , what Rewards the Senate
Will heap upon you , certain , for your Service ?
Than Safety should ; and wicked Friendship force ,
What Honesty and Vertue cannot work .
He tells you right , sweet Friend ; 'tis saving Counsel .
Most noble Consul , I am yours , and hers ;
I mean , my Countries : you have form 'd me new ,
Inspiring me with what I should be truly .
And I entreat , my Faith may not seem cheaper
For springing out of Penitence . Cic . Good Curius ,
It shall be dearer rather ; and because
I'ld make it such , hear how I trust you more .
Keep still you former Face , and mix again
With these lost Spirits ; run all their Mazes with 'em ;
For such are Treasons : Find their Windings out ,
And subtle Turnings , watch their Snakie Ways ,
Through Brakes and Hedges , into Woods of Darkness ,
Where they are fain to creep upon their Breasts
In Paths ne 'er trod by Men , but Wolves and Panthers .
Whose Names I have ; what new ones they draw in ;
Who else are likely ; what those Great ones are
They do not name ; what ways they mean to take ;
And whither their Hopes point , to War , or Ruine
By some Surprise . Explore all their Intents ;
And what you find my profit the Republick ,
Acquaint me with it , either by your self ,
Or this your vertuous Friend , on whom I lay
The Care of urging you . I 'll see that Rome
Shall prove a thankful and a bounteous Mother .
Be secret as the Night . Cur . And constant , Sir .
I do not doubt it ; though the time cut off
All Vows . The Dignity of Truth is lost
With much protesting . Who is there ! This way ,
Lest you be seen and met . And when you come ,
Be this your Token to this Fellow . Light 'em .
O Rome , in what a Sickness art thou fall 'n !
How dangerous and deadly ! when thy Head
Is drown 'd in Sleep , and all thy Body Fev'ry !
No Noise , no Pulling , no Vexation wakes thee ,
Thy Lethargy is such : or if , by chance ,
Thou heav 'st thy Eye lids up , thou dost forget
Sooner than thou wert told , thy proper Danger .
I did unreverently , to blame the Gods ,
Who wake for thee , though thou snore for thy self .
Is it not strange , thou should 'st be so diseas 'd ,
And so secure ? But more , that the first Symptoms
Of such a Malady should not rise out
From any worthy Member , but a base
And common Strumpet , worthless to be nam 'd
A Hair , or part of thee ? Think , think , hereafter ,
What thy needs were , when thou must use such Means :
And lay it to thy Breast , how much the Gods
Upbraid thy foul neglect of them , by making
So vile a thing the Author of thy Safety .
They could have wrought by nobler ways , have struck
Thy Foes with forked Lightning , or ramm 'd Thunder ;
Death , like a Damp , to all their Families ;
Or caus 'd their Consciences to burst 'em . But
When they will shew thee what thou art , and make
A scornful difference 'twixt their Power and thee ,
They help thee by such Aids as Geese and Harlots .
How now ? What answer ? Is he come ? Lic . Your Brother
Will streight be here ; and your Colleague Antonius
Troubles me somewhat , and is worth my fear .
He is a Man 'gainst whom I must provide ,
That ( as he 'll do no good ) he do no harm .
He , though he be not of the Plot , will like it ,
And wish it should proceed : for , unto Men
Prest with their Wants , all Change is ever welcom .
I must with Offices and Patience win him ,
Make him by Art , that which he is not born ,
A Friend unto the Publick , and bestow
The Province on him , which is by the Senate
Decreed to me ; that Benefit will bind him .
' Tis well , if some Men will do well for Price :
So few are vertuous when the Reward 's away .
Nor must I be unmindful of my Private ,
For which I have call 'd my Brother , and the Tribunes ,
My Kinsfolk , and my Clients , to be near me .
He that stands up 'gainst Traitors , and their Ends ,
Shall need a double Guard , of Law , and Friends :
Especially in such an envious State ,
That sooner will accuse the Magistrate ,
Than the Delinquent ; and will rather grieve
The Treason is not acted , than believe .
THe Night grows on , and you are for your Meeting :
I 'll therefore end in few . Be resolute ,
And put your Enterprise in act . The more
The less assuredly they are perform 'd .
And thence it hapneth , that the bravest Plots
( Not executed streight ) have been discover 'd .
Say , you are constant , or another , a third ,
Or more ; there may be yet one wretched Spirit ,
With whom the fear of Punishment shall work
' Bove all the thoughts of Honour and Revenge .
You are not now to think what 's best to do ,
As in Beginnings ; but what must be done ,
Being thus entred ; and slip no advantage
That may secure you . Let 'em call it Mischief :
When it is past , and prosper 'd , 'twill be Vertue .
Th'are petty Crimes are punish 'd , great rewarded .
Nor must you think of Peril , since Attempts
Begun with Danger , still do end with Glory ;
And , when Need spurs , Despair will be call 'd Wisdom .
Less ought the care of Men or Fame to fright you ;
For they that win , do seldom receive shame
Of Victory , how e 'er it be atehiev 'd ;
And Vengeance , least . For who , besieg 'd with Wants ,
Would stop at Death , or any thing beyond it ?
Come , there was never any great thing yet
Aspired , but by Violence or Fraud :
And he that sticks ( for folly of a Conscience )
To reach it ? Cat . Is a good Religious Fool .
A superstitious Slave , and will die Beast .
Good night . You know what Crassus thinks , and I ,
By this . Prepare you Wings as large as Sails ,
To cut through Air , and leave no Print behind you .
A Serpent , e 'er he comes to be a Dragon ,
Does eat a Bat ; and so must you a Consul ,
That watches . What you do , do quickly , Sergius .
You shall not stir for me . Cat . Excuse me . Lights there .
By no means .
Stay then . All good thoughts to C?sar .
And like to Crassus .
Mind but your Friends Counsels .
O Are your Confederates come ? the Ladies ? Aur . Yes .
And is Sempronia there ?
She is . Cat . That 's well .
She has a sulphrous Spirit , and will take
Light at a Spark . Break with them , gentle Love ,
About the drawing as many of their Husbands
Into the Plot , as can ; if not , to rid 'em .
That 'll be the easier practice unto some ,
Who have been tir 'd with 'em long . Sollicit
Their Aids for Money , and their Servants help ,
In firing of the City at the time
Shall be design 'd . Promise 'em States , and Empires ,
And Men , for Lovers , made of better Clay
Than ever the old Porter Titan knew .
Who 's that ? O , Porcius Lecca ! are they met ?
They are all here .
Love , you have your Instructions :
I 'll trust you with the Stuff you have to work on .
You 'll form it ? Porcius , fetch the Silver Eagle
I ga' you in charge ; and pray 'em they will enter .
O Friends , your Faces glad me . This will be
Our last , I hope , of Consultation .
So it had need . Cur . We lose Occasion daily .
I , and our Means ; whereof one wounds me most
That was the fairest : Piso is dead in Spain .
As we are here . Lon . And , as 'tis thought , by env
Of Pompey 's Followers . Len . He too 's coming back
Now out of Asia . Cat . Therefore , what we intend ,
We must be swift in . Take your Seats , and hear .
I have already sent Septimius
Into the Picene Territory , and Julius ,
To raise Force for us in Apulia ;
Manlius at Fesul? is ( by this time ) up ,
With the old needy Troops that follow 'd Sylla :
And all do but expect when we we will give
The Blow at home . Behold this Silver Eagle ,
' Twas Marius Standard in the Cimbrian War ,
Fatal to Rome ; and , as our Augures tell me ,
Shall still be so : for which one ominous Cause ,
I have kept it safe , and done it sacred Rites ,
As to a Godhead , in a Chappel built
Of purpose to it . Pledge then all your Hands ,
To follow it , with Vows of Death and Ruine ,
Struck silently , and home . So Waters speak
When they run deepest . Now 's the time , this year ,
The twentieth from the firing of the Capitol ,
As fatal too to Rome , by all Predictions ;
And in which honour 'd Lentulus must rise
A King , if he pursue it . Cur . If he do not ,
He is not worthy the great Destiny .
It is too great for me ; but what the Gods
And their great Loves decree me , I must not
Seem
Seem careless of . Cat . No, nor we envious .
We have enough beside ; all Gallia , Belgia ,
Now Pompey is returning . Cat . Noblest Romans ,
Me thinks our Looks are not so quick and high
As they were wont .
No ? whose is not ? Cat . We have
No Anger in our Eyes , no Storm , no Lightning :
Our Hate is spent , and fum 'd away in Vapour ,
Before our Hands be at work . I can accuse
Not any one , but all , of slackness . Cet . Yes ,
And be your self such , while you do it . Cat . Ha ?
' Tis sharply answer 'd , Caius . Cet . Truly , truly .
Come , let us each one know his part to do ,
And then be accus 'd . Leave these untimely Quarrels .
I would there were more Romes than one to ruin .
More Romes ? More Worlds .
Nay then , more Gods , and Natures ,
If they took part . Len . When shall the time be , first ?
I think , the Saturnals . Cet . ' Twill be too long .
They are not now far off , 'tis not a Month .
A Week , a Day , an Hour is too far off :
Now were the fittest time . Cat . We ha' not laid
All things so safe and ready . Cet . While we are laying ,
We shall all lie , and grow to Earth . Would I
Were nothing in it , if not now . These things
They should be done , e 'er thought .
Nay , now your Reason
Forsakes you , Caius . Think but what commodity
That time will minister ; the Cities Custom
Of being then in Mirth and Feast ? Len . Loos 'd whole
In Pleasure and Security ? Aut . Each House
Resolv 'd in Freedom ? Cur . Every Slave a Master ?
And they too no mean Aids ?
Made from their hope
Of Liberty ? Len . Or hate unto their Lords .
' Tis sure , there cannot be a time found out
More apt and natural . Len . Nay , good Cethegus ,
VVhy do your Passions now disturb our Hopes ?
VVhy do your Hopes delude our Certainties ?
You must lend him his way . Think , for the Order ,
And Process of it . Lon . Yes . Len . I like not Fire ;
' Twill too much waste my City . Cat . VVere it Embers ,
There will be VVealth enough , rak't out of them ,
To spring anew . It must be Fire , or nothing .
VVhat else should fright or terrifie 'em ? Var . True .
In that Confusion , must be the chief Slaughter .
Then we shall kill 'em bravest . Cep. And in heaps .
Strew Sacrifices . Cur . Make the Earth an Altar .
And Rome the Fire . Lec. ' Twill be a noble Night .
And worth all Sylla 's Days .
VVhen Husbands , VVives ,
Grandsires , and Nephews , Servants , and their Lords ,
Virgins , and Priests , the Infant , and the Nurse ,
Go all to Hell together in a Fleet .
I would have you , Longinus , and Statilius ,
To take the Charge o ' the Firing , which must be
At a Sign given with a Trumpet , done
In twelve chief Places of the City at once .
The Flax and Sulphur are already laid
In at Cethegus House ; so are the VVeapons .
The Pipes and Conduits , and kill those that come
For VVater . Cur . VVhat shall I do ? Cat . All will have
Employment , fear not : Ply the Execution .
For that , trust me , and Cethegus . Cat . I will be
At hand , with the Army , to meet those that scape :
And Lentulus , begirt you Pompey 's House ,
To seise his sons alive ; for they are they
Must make our peace with him . All else cut off ,
As Tarquin did the Poppy-heads , or Mowers
A Field of Thistles , or else , up , as Plows
Do barren Lands , and strike together Flints
And Clods , th ' ungrateful Senate and the People ;
Till no Rage gone before , or coming after ,
May weigh with yours , though Horrour leapt her self
The fall of Torrents , and the noise of Tempests ,
The boyling of Carybdis , the Seas wildness ,
The eating force of Flames , and wings of VVinds ,
Be all out-wrought by your transcendent Furies .
It had been done e 'er this , had I been Consul ;
We had had no stop , no let . Len . How find you Antonius ?
Th' other has won him , lost : that Cicero
VVas born to be my opposition ,
And stands in all our ways . Cur . Remove him first .
May that yet be done sooner ?
VVould it were done .
Var . I 'll do 't .
It is my Province ; none usurp it .
What are your Means ?
Enquire not . He shall die .
Shall , was too slowly said . He 's dying . That
Is yet too slow . He 's dead . Cat . Brave , only Roman ,
Whose Soul might be the Worlds Soul , were that dying ;
Refuse not yet the Aids of these your Friends .
Here 's Vargunteius holds good quarter with him .
And under the pretext of Clientele ,
And Visitation , with the morning Hail ,
Will be admitted . Cet . What is that to me ?
Yes , we may kill him in his Bed , and safely .
Safe is your way then , take it . Mine 's mine own .
Follow him , Vargunteius , and persuade ,
The Morning is the fittest time . Lon . The Night
Will turn all into Tumult . Len . And perhaps
Miss of him too . Cat . Entreat and conjure him
In all our Names ? Len . By all our Vows and Friendships .
WHat ! is our Council broke up first ? Aur . You say ,
Women are greatest Talkers . Sem . We ha' done ,
And are now fit for action . Lon . VVhich is Passion .
There 's your best activity , Lady . Sem . How
Knows your wise Fatness that ?
Your Mothers Daughter
Did teach me , Madam . Cet . Come Sempronia , leave him ;
He is a Giber ; and our present Business
Is of more serious consequence . Aurelia
Tells me , you ' have done most masculinely within ,
And play the Orator . Sem . But we must hasten
To our Design as well , and execute ;
Not hang still in the Fever of an Accident .
You say well , Lady . Sem . I do like our Plot
Exceeding well ; 'tis sure , and we shall leave
Little to Fortune in it . Cat . Your Banquet stays .
Aurelia , take her in . VVhere 's Fulvia ?
O , the two Lovers are coupling . Cur . In good faith ,
She 's very ill with sitting up . Sem . You 'ld have her
Laugh , and lie down ? Ful . No, faith , Sempronia ,
I am not well : I 'll take my leave , it draws
Toward the Morning . Curius shall stay with you .
Madam , I pray you pardon me : my Health
I must respect . Aur . Farewel , good Fulvia .
Make haste , and bid him get his Guards about him .
For Vargunteius and Cornelius
Have undertane it , should Cethegus miss :
Their Reason , that they think his open Rashness
VVill suffer easier discovery
Than their Attempt , so vailed under Friendship .
I 'll bring you to your Coach . Tell him , beside ,
Of C?sar 's coming forth here . Cat . My sweet Madam ,
VVill you be gone ? Ful . I am , my Lord , in truth ,
In some Indisposition . Cat . I do wish
You had all your Health , sweet Lady . Lentulus ,
You 'll do her Service . Len . To her Coach , and Duty .
WHat Ministers Men must for practice use !
The rash , th ' ambitious , needy , desperate ,
Foolish , and wretched , ev'n the Dregs of Mankind ,
To Whores , and Women ! Still it must be so .
Each have their proper place , and in their Rooms
They are the best . Grooms fittest kindle Fires ,
Slaves carry Burdens , Butchers are for Slaughters ,
As these for me : Dull stupid Lentulus ,
My Stale , with whom I stalk ; the rash Cethegus
My Executioner ; and fat Longinus ,
My Labourers , Pioneers , and Incendiaries :
With these Domestick Traitors , Bosom-thieves ,
Whom Custom hath call 'd Wives ; the readiest Helps
To betray heady Husbands , rob the easie ,
And lend the Moneys on Returns of Lust .
So sought , so sorted , something shall be call 'd
Their Labour , but his Profit ? and make C?sar
Repent his vent 'ring Counsels to a Spirit
So much his Lord in Mischief ? when all these
Shall , like the Brethren sprung of Dragons Teeth ,
Ruin each other , and he fall amongst 'em ,
With Crassus , Pompey , or who else appears
But like , or near a Great one . May my Brain
Resolve to Water , and my Blood turn Phlegm ,
My Hands drop off , unworthy of my Sword ,
And that b' inspired of it self to rip
My Breast for my lost Entrails , when I leave
A Soul that will not serve ; and who will , are
The same with Slaves , such Clay I dare not fear .
The Cruelty I mean to act , I wish
Should be call 'd mine , and tarry in my Name ;
Whilst After-ages do toil out themselves
In thinking for the like , but do it less :
And were the Power of all the Fiends let loose ,
With Fate to boot , it should be still Example ,
When , what the Gaul or Moor could not effect ,
Nor emulous Carthage , with their length of spite ,
Shall be the Work of one , and that my Night .
I Thank your Vigllance . Where 's my Brother , Quintus ?
Call all my Servants up . Tell noble Curius ,
And say it to your self , you are my Savers :
But that 's too little for you ; you are Romes .
What could I then hope less ? O Brother ! now
The Engines I told you of are working ,
The Machin 'gins to move . Where are your Weapons ?
Arm all my Houshold presently , and charge
The Porter , he let no Man in till day .
Not Clients , and your Friends ?
They wear those Names ,
That come to murder me . Yet send for Cato ,
And Quintus Catulus ; those I dare trust :
And Flaccus , and Pomptinius , the Pr?tors ,
By the back way . Qui . Take care , good Brother Marcus ,
Your Fears be not form 'd greater than they should ;
And make your Friends grieve , while your Enemies laugh .
' Tis Brothers Counsel , and worth thanks . But do
As I entreat you . I provide , not fear .
Was C?sar rhere , say you ? Ful . Curius says , he met him
Coming from thence . Cic . O , so . And had you a Council
Of Ladies too ? Who was your Speaker , Madam ?
She that would be , had there been forty more ;
Sempronia , who had both her Greek and Figures ,
And ever and anon would ask us if
The witty Consul could have mended that ,
Or Orator Cicero could have said it better ?
She 's my gentle Enemy . Would Cethegus
Had no more danger in him . But my Guards
Are you , great Powers , and th ' unbated Strengths
Of a firm Conscience , which shall arm each Step
Tane for the State ; and teach me slack no Pace
For fear of malice . How now , Brother ? Qui . Cato ,
And Quintus Catulus were coming to you ,
And Crassus with 'em . I have let 'em in
By th ' Garden . Cic . What would Crassus have ? Qui . I hear
Some whispering 'bout the Gate , and making doubt
Whether it be not yet too early , or no ?
But I do think , they are your Friends and Clients ,
Are fearful to disturb you . Cic . You will change
T' another thought anon . Ha' you giv'n the Porter
The Charge I will 'd you ?
Yes . Withdraw , and hearken .
Catulus , Crassus .
THe Door 's not open yet .
You were best to knock .
Let them stand close then ; and , when we are in ,
Rush after us . Cor . But where 's Cethegus ? Var . He
Has left it , since he might not do 't his way .
Who 's there ? Var . A Friend , or more .
I may not let
Any man in , till day . Var . No ? why ? Cor . Thy Reason ?
I am commanded so . Var . By whom ? Cor . I hope
We are not discover 'd . Var . Yes , by Revelation .
Pr'y thee , good Slave , who has commanded thee ?
He that may best , the Consul .
We are his Friends .
All 's one . Cor . Best give your Name .
Dost thou hear , Fellow ?
I have some instant Business with the Consul .
My Name is Vargunteius .
True , he knows it ,
from above .
And for what friendly Office you are sent .
Cornelius too is there ? Var . We are betray 'd .
And desperate Cethegus , is he not ?
Speak you , he knows my Voice .
What say you to't ?
You are deceiv 'd , Sir . Cic . No, 'tis you are so ;
Poor mis-led men . Your States are yet worth Pity ,
If you would hear , and change your savage minds .
Leave to be mad ; forsake your Purposes
Of Treason , Rapine , Murder , Fire , and Horror ;
The Commonwealth hath Eyes , that wake as sharply
Over her Life , as yours do for her Ruin .
Be not deceiv 'd , to think her Lenity
Will be perpetual ; or , if Men be wanting ,
The Gods will be , to such a calling Cause .
Consider your Attempts , and while there 's time ,
Repent you of 'em . It doth make me tremble ,
There should those Spirits yet breath , that when they cannot
Live honestly , would rather perish basely .
You talk too much to 'em , Marcus , they are lost .
Go forth , and apprehend 'em . Catu . If you prove
This Practice , what should let the Commonwealth
To take due Vengeance ? Var . Let us shift away .
The Darkness hath conceal 'd us yet . We 'll say ,
Some have abus 'd our Names . Cor . Deny it all .
Quintus , what Guards ha' you ? Call the Tribunes Aid ,
And raise the City . Consul , you are too mild .
The foulness of some Facts takes thence all Mercy .
Report it to the Senate . Hear ! The Gods
Grow angry with your Patience . ' Tis their Care ,
And must be yours , that guilty Men escape not .
As Crimes do grow , Justice should rowse it self .
WHat is this , Heavens , you prepare
With so much swiftness , and so sudden rising ?
There are no Sons of Earth that dare ,
Again , Rebellion ? or the Gods surprising ?
The World doth shake , and Nature fears ;
Yet is the Tumult , and the Horror greater
Within our Minds , than in our Ears :
So much Rome 's Faults ( now grown her Fate ) do threat her .
The Priest and People run about ,
Each Order , Age , and Sex amaz 'd at other ;
And at the Ports all thronging out ,
As if their Safety were to quit their Mother :
Yet find they the same Dangers there ,
From which they make such haste to be preserved :
For guilty States do ever bear
The Plagues about them which they have deserved .
And till those Plagues do get above
The Mountains of our Faults , and there do sit ;
We see 'em not . Thus still we love
The Evil we do , until we suffer it .
But most , Ambition , that near Vice
To Vertue , hath the Fate of Rome provoked ;
And made that now Rome 's self no price
To free her from the Death wherewith she 's yoked .
That restless Ill that still doth build
Upon success ; and ends not in aspiring :
But there begins ; and ne 're is fill 'd
While ought remains that seems but worth desiring .
Wherein the Thought , unlike the Eye ,
To which things far seem smaller than they are ,
Deems all Contentment plac 'd on high :
And thinks there 's nothing great but what is far .
O , that in time Rome did not cast
Her Errors up , this Fortune to prevent ;
T' have seen her Crimes e 're they were past ,
And felt her Faults before her Punishment .
Divers Senators pass by , quaking and trembling .
CAN these Men fear , who are not only ours ,
But the World 's Masters ? Then I see the Gods
Upbraid our Suff'rings , or would humble them ,
By sending these affrights while we are here :
That we might laugh at their ridiculous Fear ,
Whose Names we trembled at beyond the Alpes .
Of all that pass , I do not see a Face
Worthy a Man ; that dares look up , and stand
One Thunder out : but downward all , like Beasts ,
Running away from every flash is made .
The falling world could not deserve such baseness .
Are we imploy 'd here by our Miseries ,
Like superstitious Fools ( or rather Slaves )
To plain our Griefs , Wrongs and Oppressions ,
To a meer clothed Senate , whom our Folly
Hath made , and still intends to keep our Tyrants ?
It is our base petitionary breath
That blows 'em to this Greatness ; which this prick
Would soon let out , if we were bold and wretched .
When they have taken all we have , our Goods ,
Crop , Lands and Houses , they will leave us this :
A Weapon and an Arm will still be found ,
Tho naked left , and lower than the ground .
DO ; urge thine Anger still : good Heaven and just .
Tell guilty men what Powers are above them .
In such a confidence of wickedness
' Twas time they should know something fit to fear .
I never saw a Morn more full of Horror .
Tho Heaven should speak with all his wrath at once ,
That with his breath the Hinges of the World
Did crack , we should stand upright , and unfear 'd .
Why , so we do , good Cato . Who be these ?
Ambassadors from the Allobroges ,
I take 'em , by their habits .
I , these Men
Seem of another Race ; let 's sue to these ,
There 's hope of Justice with their Fortitude .
Friends of the Senate , and of Rome , to day
We pray you to forbear us : On the morrow ,
What Suit you have , let us , by Fabius Sanga ,
( Whose Patronage your State doth use ) but know it ,
And on the Consuls Word , you shall receive
Dispatch , or else an Answer worth your Patience .
We could not hope for more , most worthy
This Magistrate hath struck an awe into me ,
And by his Sweetness won a more regard
Unto his Place , than all the boistrous Moods
That ignorant Greatness practiseth , to fill
The large unfit Authority it wears .
How easie is a Noble Spirit discer n 'd
From harsh and sulphurous matter , that flies out
In Contumelies , makes a noise , and stinks !
May we find good and great Men ; that know how
To stoop to Wants , and meet Necessities ,
And will not turn from any equal Suits .
Such Men , they do not succour more the Cause
They undertake with favour and success ,
Than by it their own Judgments they do raise ,
In turning just Mens Needs into their Praise .
The Senate .
P Room for the Consuls . Fathers , take your places .
Here in the House of Jupiter the Stayer ,
By Edict from the Consul , Marcus Tullius ,
You 'are met , a frequent Senate . Hear him speak .
What may be happy and auspicious , still
To Rome and hers . Honour 'd and Conscript Fathers ,
If I were silent , and that all the Dangers
Threatning the State any you , were yet so hid
In Night , or Darkness thicker in their Breasts ,
That are the black Contrivers ; so that no
Beam of the Light could pierce 'em ; yet the Voice
Of Heav'n , this Morning , hath spoke loud enough
T' instruct you with a feeling of the Horror ,
And wake you from a Sleep as stark as Death .
I have of late spoke often in this Senate
Touching this Argument , but still have wanted
Either your Ears or Faith ; So incredible
Their Plots have seem 'd , or I so vain , to make
These things for mine own Glory and false Greatness ,
As hath been given out . But be it so .
When they break forth , and shall declare themselves
By their too foul Effects , then , then the Envy
Of my just Cares will find another Name .
For me , I am but one , and this poor Life
So lately aim 'd at , not an Hour yet since ,
They cannot with more eagerness pursue ,
Than I with gladness would lay down , and lose ,
To buy Romes Peace , if that would purchase it .
But when I see they 'ld make it but the step
To more and greater ; unto yours , Romes , all ;
I would
I would with those preserve it , or then fall .
I , I , let you alone , cunning Artificer !
See how his Gorget peers above his Gown ;
To tell the people in what danger he was .
It was absurdly done of Vargunteius ,
To name himself before he was got in .
It matters not , so they deny it all :
And can but carry the lye constantly .
I have sent for him .
And ha' you bid him to be confident ?
To that his own necessity will prompt him .
Seem to believe nothing at all that Cicero
Relates us . C?s . It will mad him .
O , and help
The other Party . Who is that ? his Brother ?
What new Intelligence has he brought him now ?
Some Cautions from his Wife , how to behave him .
Place some of them without , and some bring in .
Thank their kind Loves . It is a comfort yet ,
That all depart not from their Countries Cause .
How now , what means this Muster , Consul
Antonius ?
I do not know , ask my Colleague , he 'll tell you .
There is some Reason in State that I must yield to ;
And I have promis 'd him : Indeed he has bought it ,
With giving me the Province .
I profess ,
It grieves me , Fathers , that I am compell 'd
To draw these Arms , and aids for your defence ;
And more , against a Citizen of Rome ,
Born here amongst you , a Patrician ,
A man , I must confess , of no mean House ,
Nor no small Vertue , if he had employ 'd
Those Excellent Gifts of Fortune , and of Nature ,
Unto the good , not ruine of the State .
But being bred in 's Father 's needy Fortunes ,
Brought up in 's Sisters Prostitution ,
Confirm 'd in civil Slaughter , entring first
The Commonwealth , with Murder of the Gentry ;
Since both by Study and Custom conversant
With all Licentiousness . what could be hop 'd
In such a Field of Riot , but a course
Extream pernicious ? Tho I must protest ,
I found his Mischiefs sooner with mine Eyes
Than with my Thought ; and with these Hands of mine ,
Before they touch 'd at my suspicion .
What are his Mischiefs , Consul ? you declame
Against his Manners , and corrupt your own :
No wise man should , for hate of guilty men ,
Lose his own Innocence .
The Noble C?sar
Speaks God-like truth . But when he hears I can
Convince him , by his Manners , of his Mischiefs ,
He might be silent ; and not cast away
His Sentences in vain , where they scarce look
Toward his Subject .
Here he comes himself .
If he be worthy any good man 's voice ,
That good man sit down by him : Cato will not .
If Cato leave him , I'le not keep aside .
What Face is this the Senate here puts on
Against me , Fathers ! Give my Modesty
Leave to demand the cause of so much strangeness .
It is reported here , you are the Head
To a strange Faction , Lucius .
I , and will
Be prov 'd against him .
Let it be . Why , Consul ,
If in the Commonwealth there be two Bodies ,
One lean , weak , rotten , and that hath a Head ;
The other strong and healthful , but hath none :
If I do give it one , do I offend ?
Restore your selves unto your temper , Fathers ;
And , without perturbation , hear me speak .
Remember who I am , and of what place ,
What petty fellow this is that opposes ;
One that hath exercis 'd his Eloquence
Still to the bane of the Nobility :
A boasting insolent tongue-man .
Peace , lewd Traytor ,
Or wash thy Mouth . He is an honest man ,
And loves his Counttey ; would thou didst so too .
Cato , you are too zealous for him .
No ;
Thou art too impudent .
Nay then , I easily fear , my just defence
Will come too late to so much prejudice !
Will he sit down ? )
Yet let the world forsake me ,
My Innocence must not .
Thou innocent ?
So are the Furies . Cic . Yes , and Ate too .
Or hath the paleness of thy Guilt drunk up
Thy Blood , and drawn thy Veins as dry of that
As is thy Heart of Truth , thy Breast of Vertue ?
Whither at length wilt thou abuse our patience ?
Still shall thy Fury mock us ? To what licence
Dares thy unbridled boldness run it self ?
Do all the nightly Guards , kept on the Palace ,
The Cities Watches , with the Peoples Fears ,
The Concourse of all good men , this so strong
And fortified Seat here of the Senate ,
The present looks upon thee , strike thee nothing ?
Dost thou not feel thy Counsels all laid open ?
And see thy wild Conspiracy bound in
With each man 's knowledge ? which of all this Order
Canst thou think ignorant ( if they 'll but utter
Their Conscience to the right ) of what thou didst
Last Night , what on the former , where thou wert ,
Whom thou didst call together , what your Plots were ?
O Age and Manners ! This the Consul sees ,
The Senate understands , yet this man lives !
Lives ? I , and comes here into Counsel with us ;
Partakes the Publick Cares : and with his Eye
Marks and points out each Man of us to slaughter .
And we , good Men , do satisfie the State ,
If we can shun but this Man 's Sword and Madness .
There was that Vertue once in Rome , when good men ,
Would , with more sharp Coercion , have restrain 'd
A wicked Citizen , than the deadliest Foe .
Nor the Authority of this Senate ; we ,
We that are Consuls , only fail our selves .
This twenty days the Edg of that Decree
We have let dull and rust ; kept it shut up ,
As in a Sheath , which drawn , should take thy Head .
Yet still thou liv'st : and liv'st not to lay by
Thy wicked Confidence , but to confirm it .
I could desire , grave Fathers , to be found
Still merciful , to seem , in these main perils
Grasping the State , a Man remiss and slack ;
But then I should condemn my self of Sloth
And Treachery . Their Camp 's in Italy ,
Pitch 'd in the Jaws here of Hetruria ;
Their Numbers daily increasing , and their General
Within our Walls : nay , in our Counsel ! plotting
Hourly some fatal mischief to the Publick .
Here to be taken , kill 'd ; I make just doubt ,
Whether all good men would not think it done
Rather too late , than any man too cruel .

Except he were of the same Meal and Batch .
But that which ought to have been done long
since ,
I will , and ( for good Reason ) yet forbear .
Then will I take thee , when no Man is found
So lost , so wicked , nay , so like thy self ,
But shall profess , 'tis done of need and right .
While there is one that dares defend thee , live ;
Thou shalt have leave , but so as now thou liv'st ;
Watch 'd at a hand , besieged , and opprest
From working least Commotion to the State .
I have those Eyes and Ears shall still keep guard ,
And spial on thee , as they have ever done ,
And thou not feel it . What then canst thou hope ?
If neither Night can with her Darkness hide
Thy wicked Meetings , nor a Private House
Can in her Walls contain the guilty whispers
Of thy Conspiracy : If all break out ,
All be discover 'd , change thy mind at last ,
And lose thy thoughts of Ruine , Flame and Slaughter .
Remember how I told , here to the Senate ,
That such a day thy Lictor , Caius Manlius ,
Or in the Fact , or in the Time ? the Hour ?
I told too in this Senate , that thy purpose
Was on the Fifth ( the Kalends of November )
T' have slaughter 'd this whole Order : which my caution
Made many leave the City . Canst thou here
Deny , but this thy black Design was hindred
That very day by me ? Thy self clos 'd in
Within my strengths , so that thou could 'st not move
Against a publick Reed ? When thou wert heard
To say upon the parting of the rest ,
Thou would 'st content thee with the Murder of us
That did remain . Hadst thou no hope beside ,
By a surprize by Night , to take Pr?nest? ?
Where when thou cam 'st , didst thou not find the place
Made good against thee with my Aids , my Watches ?
My Garrisons fortified it . Thou dost nothing , Sergius ;
Thou canst endeavour nothing , nay , not think ,
But I both see and hear it ; and am with thee ,
By and before , about and in thee too .
Call but to mind thy last Nights business . Come ,
I'le use no Circumstance : at Lecca 's House ,
The Shop , and Mint of your Conspiracy ,
Among your Sword-men , where so many Associates
Both of thy Mischief and thy Madness met .
Dar 'st thou deny this ? Wherefore art thou silent ?
Speak , and this shall convince thee : Here they are ,
I see 'em in this Senate , that were with thee .
O , you Immortal Gods ! in what Clime are we ?
What Region do we live in ? in what Air ?
What Commonwealth or State is this we have ?
In this most holy Council of the world
They are that seek the Spoil of me , of you ,
Of ours , of all ; what I can name 's too narrow :
Follow the Sun , and find not their Ambition .
These I behold , being Consul ; nay , I ask
Their Counsels of the State , as from good Patriots :
Whom it were fit the Axe should hew in pieces ,
I not so much as wound yet with my Voice .
Your Shares of Italy you there divided ;
Appointed who , and whither each should go ;
What Men should stay behind in Rome , were chosen ;
Your Offices set down ; the parts mark 'd out ,
And places of the City , for the fire ;
Thy self ( thou affirm 'dst ) wast ready to depart ,
Only a little let there was that stay 'd thee ,
That I yet liv 'd . Upon the word , stept forth
Three of thy Crew , to rid thee of that Care ;
Two undertook this Morning , before Day ,
To kill me in my Bed . All this I knew ,
Your Convent scarce dismiss 'd , arm 'd all my Servants ,
Call 'd both my Brother and Friends , shut out your
Clients
You sent to visit me ; whose Names I told
To some there , of good place , before they came .
Yes , I , and Quintus Catulus can affirm it .
He 's lost and gone . His Spirits have forsook him .
Go where thou mean 'st . The Ports are open ; forth .
The Camp abroad wants thee , their Chief , too long .
Lead with thee all thy Troops out . Purge the City .
Draw dry that noisom , and pernicious Sink ,
Which left behind thee , would infect the World .
Thou wilt free me of all my Fears at once ,
To see a Wall between us . Dost thou stop
To do that now commanded ; which before ,
Of thine own choice , thou'art prone to ? Go . The Consul
Bids thee , an Enemy , to depart the City .
Whither , thou'lt ask ? to Exile ? I not bid
Thee that . But ask my Counsel , I perswade it .
What is there , here , in Rome , that can delight thee ?
Where not a Soul , without thine own foul knot ,
But fears and hates thee . What Domestick Note
Of private filthiness , but is burnt in
Into thy Life ? What close and secret shame
But is grown one with thine own Infamy ?
What Lust was ever absent from thine Eyes ?
What lewd Fact from thy Hands ? what wickedness
From thy whole Body ? where 's that Youth drawn in
Within thy Nets , or catch 'd up with thy baits ,
Before whose Rage thou hast not borne a Sword ,
And to whose Lusts thou hast not held a Torch ?
Thy latter Nuptials I let pass in silence ;
Where sins incredible on sins were heapt :
Which I not name , lest in a Civil State
So monstrous Facts should either appear to be ,
Or not to be reveng 'd . Thy Fortunes too
I glance not at , which hang but still next Ides .
I come to that which is more known , more publick ;
The Life and Safety of us all by thee
Threatned and sought . Stood 'st thou not in the Field
When Lepidus and Tullus were our Consuls ,
Upon the day of Choice , arm 'd , and with Forces ,
To take their Lives , and our chief Citizens ?
When not thy Fear , nor Conscience chang 'd thy Mind ,
But the meer Fortune of the Commonwealth
Withstood thy active malice ? Speak but right .
How often hast thou made attempt on me ?
How many of thy Assaults have I declin 'd
With shifting but my Body ( as we 'ld say ) ,
Wrested thy Dagger from thy Hand , how oft ?
How often hath it faln , or slipt by chance ?
Yet can thy side not want it : which how vow 'd ,
Or with what Rites , 'tis sacred of thee , I know not ,
That still thou mak 'st it a Necessity ,
To fix it in the Body of a Consul .
But let me lose this way , and speak to thee ,
Not as one mov 'd with hatred , which I ought ,
But pity , of which none is owing thee .
No more than unto Tantalus or Tityus .
Thou cam 'st e 're while into this Senate . Who
Of such a frequency , so many Friends
And Kindred thou hast here saluted thee ?
Were not the Seats made bare upon thy entrance ?
Riss ' not the Consular Men , and left their places
So soon as thou sat 'st down ? and fled thy side ,
Like to a Plague or Ruine ? Knowing how oft
They had been by thee mark 'd out for the Shambles ?
How dost thou hear this ? Surely , if my Slaves
At home fear 'd me with half th ' affright and horror ,
That here thy Fellow-Citizens do thee ,
I should soon quit my House , and think it need too .
Yet thou dar 'st tarry here ? Go forth at last ,
Con-
Condemn thy self to flight and solitude .
Discharge the Commonwealth of her deep Fear .
Go ; into banishment , if thou wait 'st the word .
Why dost thou look ? They all consent unto it .
Dost thou expect th ' Authority of their Voices ,
Whose silent wills condemn thee ? While they sit ,
They approve it ; while they suffer it , they decree it ;
And while they are silent to it , they proclaim it .
Prove thou there honest , I'le endure the Envy .
But there 's no thought thou shouldst be ever he ,
Whom either shame should call from filthiness ,
Terror from danger , or discourse from Fury .
Go ; I intreat thee : yet why do I so ?
When I already know they 're sent afore ,
That tarry for thee 'in Arms , and do expect thee
On th ' Aurelian way . I know the day
Set down 'twixt thee and Manlius ; unto whom
The Silver Eagle too is sent before :
Which I do hope shall prove to thee as baneful
As thou conceiv'st it to the Commonwealth .
But may this wise and sacred Senate say ,
What mean 'st thou Marcus Tullius ? If thou know 'st
Of an intestine War ; that he 'is the Author
Of such a wickedness ; the caller out
Of men of mark in mischief , to an action
Of so much Horror ; Prince of such a Treason ;
Why dost thou send him forth ? why let him scape ?
This is to give him Liberty and Power :
Rather thou should 'st lay hold upon him , send him
To deserv 'd death , and a just punishment .
To these so holy Voices thus I answer .
If I did think it timely , Conscript Fathers ,
To punish him with death , I would not give
The Fencer use of one short Hour to breathe ;
But when there are in this grave Order some ,
Who with soft Censures still do nurse his Hopes ;
Some that with not believing have confirm 'd
His Designs more , and whose Authority
The weaker , as the worst Men too have follow 'd :
I would now send him where they all should see
Clear as the Light , his Heart shine ; where no man
Could be so wickedly , or fondly stupid ,
But should cry out , he saw , touch 'd , felt and graspt it .
Then , when he hath run out himself ; led forth
His desp'rate party with him ; blown together
Aids of all kinds , both shipwrack 'd Minds and Fortunes :
Not only the grown Evil that now is sprung
And sprouted forth , would be pluck 'd up and weeded ;
But the Stock , Root , and Seed of all the Mischiefs ,
Choaking the Commonwealth . Where should we take
Of such a swarm of Traitors only him ,
Our Cares and Fears might seem a while reliev 'd ,
But the main peril would bide still inclos 'd
Deep in the Veins and Bowels of the State .
As Humane Bodies labouring with Fevers ,
VVhile they are tost with heat , if they do take
Cold water , seem for that short space much eas 'd ,
But afterward are ten times more afflicted .
VVherefore , I say , let all this wicked Crew
Depart , divide themselves from good Men , gather
Their Forces to one Head ; as I said oft ,
Let 'em be sever 'd from us with a wall ;
Let 'em leave off attempts upon the Consul
In his own House ; to circle in the Pr?tor ;
To girt the Court with weapons ; to prepare
Fire and Balls , Swords , Torches , Sulphur , Brands :
In short , let it be writ in each Man 's Forehead
VVhat thoughts he bears the Publick . I here promise ,
Fathers Conscript , to you , and to my self ,
That Diligence in us Consuls , for my Honour 'd
Colleague abroad , and for my self at home ;
So great Authority in you ; so much
Vertue in these the Gentlemen of Rome ;
VVhom I could scarce restrain to day , in Zeal ,
From seeking out the Parricide to slaughter ;
So much consent in all good Men and Minds ,
All shall be clear , made plain , oppress 'd , reveng 'd .
And with this Omen go , pernicious Plague ,
Out of the City , to the wish 'd Destruction
Of thee and those that , to the Ruine of her ,
Have tane that bloody and black Sacrament .
Thou Jupiter , whom we do call the Stayer
Both of this City and this Empire , wilt
( VVith the same Auspice thou didst raise it first )
Drive from thy Altars , and all other Temples ,
And Buildings of this City ; from our VValls ,
Lives , States and Fortunes of our Citizens ,
This Fiend , this Fury , with his Complices .
And all th ' offence of good Men ( these known Traytors
Unto their Countrey , Thieves of Italy ,
Joyn 'd in so damn 'd a League of Mischief ) thou
VVilt with perpetual Plagues , alive and dead ,
Punish for Rome , and save her innocent Head .
If an Oration , or high Language , Fathers ,
Could make me guilty , here is one hath done it :
H' has strove to emulate this Mornings Thunder ,
VVith his prodigious Rhetorick . But I hope
This Senate is more grave than to give credit
Rashly to all the Vomits , 'gainst a Man
Of your own Order ; a Patrician ;
And one whose Ancestors have more deserv 'd
Of Rome than this Man 's Eloquence could utter ,
Turn 'd the best way : as still it is the worst .
His Eloquence hath more deserv 'd to day ,
Speaking thy Ill , than all thy Ancestors
Did in their good : and that the State will find ,
Which he hath sav 'd .
How , he ? were I that Enemy
That he would make me : I'ld not wish the State
More wretched than to need his preservation .
What do you make him , Cato , such a Hercules ?
An Atlas ? a poor petty Inmate !
Traytor .
He save the State ? A Burgess Son of Arpinum .
The Gods would rather twenty Romes should perish ,
Than have that Contumely stuck upon 'em ,
That he should share with them in the preserving
A Shed or Sign-post . Cato . Peace , thou Prodigy .
They would be forc 'd themselves again , and lost
In the first rude and indigested heap ;
E're such a wretthed Name as Cicero
Should sound with theirs .
Away , thou impudent Head .
Do you all back him ? are you silent too ?
Well , I will leave you , Fathers , I will go .
denly on Cicero .
But ? my fine dainty Speaker ? ?
What now , Fury ?
Wilt thou assault me here ?
Help , aid the Consul . )
See , Fathers , laugh you not ? who threatned him ?
In vain thou dost conceive , ambitious Orator ,
Hope of so brave a Death as by this Hand .
Out of the Court with the pernicious traytor . )
There is no Title that this flattering Senate ,
Nor Honour the base Multitude can give thee ,
Stop ,
Stop that portentous Mouth . )
Or when it shall
I 'll look thee dead .
Will none restrain the Monster ?
Parricide .
Butcher , Traytor , leave the Senate .
I ' am gone , to banishment , to please you , Fathers .
Thrust head-long forth ?
Still dost thou murmur , Monster ?

Since I am thus put out , and made a ?
VVhat ?
Not guiltier than thou art .
I will not burn
VVithout my Funeral Pile . Cato . VVhat says the Fiend ?
I will have matter , Timber .
Sing out , Scriech-owl .
It shall be in ? ?
Speak thy imperfect Thoughts .
The common Fire , rather than mine own .
For fall I will with all , e 're fall alone .
He 's lost , there is no hope of him . C?s . Unless
He presently take Arms ; and give a blow ,
Before the Consuls forces can be levi 'd .
VVhat is your pleasure , Fathers , shall be done ?
See , that the Commonwealth receive no loss .
Commit the care thereof unto the Consuls .
' Tis time . C?s . And need .
Thanks to this frequent Senate .
But what decree they unto Curius ,
And Fulvia ? Catu . VVhat the Consul shall think meet .
They must receive reward , though't be not known ;
Lest when a State needs Ministers , they ha' none .
Yet Marcus Tullius do not I believe ,
But Crassus and this C?sar here ring hollow .
And would appear so , if that we durst prove 'em .
VVhy dare we not ? VVhat honest act is that ,
The Roman Senate should not dare and do ?
To stir too many Serpents up at once .
C?sar and Crassus , if they be ill Men ,
Are mighty ones ; and we must so provide ,
That while we take one Head from this foul Hydra ,
There spring not twenty more . Cato . I'prove your Counsel .
They shall be watch 'd and look 'd too . Till they do
Declare themselves , I will not put 'em out
By any question . There they stand . I 'll make
My self no Enemies , nor the State no Traytors .

FAlse to our selves ? All our design 's discover 'd
To this State-cat ? Cet . I , had I had my way ,
He had mew 'd in Flames at home , not i' the Senate :
I had sing 'd his Furs by this time . Cat . Well there 's now
No time of calling back , or standing still .
Friends be you selves ; keep the same Roman Hearts
And ready Minds you had yester-night . Prepare
To execute what we resolv 'd . And let not
Labour , or danger , or discovery fright you .
I 'll to the Army : you ( the while ) mature
Things here at home . Draw to you any Aids
That you think fit , of Men of all Conditions ,
Of any Fortunes that may help a War .
I 'll bleed a Life , or win an Empire for you .
Within these few days look to see my Ensigns
Here at the VValls : Be you but firm within .
Mean time , to draw an envy on the Consul ,
And give a less suspicion of our Course ,
Let it be given out here in the City ,
That I am gone an innocent Man to exile
Into Massilia , willing to give way
To Fortune and the Times ; being unable
To stand so great Faction , without troubling
The Commonwealth : whose peace I rather seek ,
Than all the glory of Contention ,
Or the support of mine own Innocence .
Farewel the noble Lentulus , Longinus ,
Curius , the rest ; and thou my better Genius ,
The brave Cethegus : when we meet again ,
VVe 'll sacrifice to Liberty . Cet . And Revenge .
That we may praise our hands once . Len . O you Fates ,
Give Fortune now her Eyes , to see with whom
She goes along , that she may ne 're forsake him .
He needs not her nor them . Go but on , Sergius .
A valiant Man is his own Fate and Fortune .
The Fate and Fortune of us all go with him .
Sta . And ever guard him .
I am all your Creature .
Now Friends 'tis left with us . I have already
Dealt by Umbrenus wlth the Allobroges ,
Here resiant in Rome ; whose State I hear ,
Is discontent with the great Usuries
They are oppres 'd with : and have made Complaints
Divers unto the Senate , but all vain .
These Men I have thought ( both for their own Oppressions ,
As also that by Nature , they are a People
Warlike and fierce , still watching after change ,
And now in present hatred with our State )
The fittest , and the easiest to be drawn
To our Society , and to aid the War .
The rather for their Seat ; being next Bord 'rers
On Italy ; and that they abound with Horse :
Of which one want our Camp doth only labour .
And I have found 'em coming . They will meet
Soon at Sempronia 's House , where I would pray you
All to be present , to confirm 'em more .
The sight of such Spirits hurt not , nor the Store .
I will not fail . Sta . Nor I.
Nor I. Cet . Would I
Had somewhat by my self apart to do .
I ha' no Genius to these many Counsels .
Let me kill all the Senate for my share ,
I 'll do it at next sitting . Len . Worthy Caius ,
Your presence will add much . Cet . I shall mar more .
THe State 's beholden unto you , Fabius Sanga ,
For this great care . And those Allobroges
Are more than wretched , if they lend a listning
To such perswasion . San . They , most worthy Consul ,
As Men employ 'd here , from a grieved State ,
Groaning beneath a multitude of Wrongs ,
And being told , there was small hope of ease
To be expected to their Evils from hence ,
Were willing at the first to give an ear
To any thing that sounded Liberty :
But since , on better Thoughts , and my urg 'd Reasons ,
They are come about , and won to the true side .
The Fortune of the Common-wealth hath conquer 'd .
What is that same Umbrenus was the Agent ?
One that hath had negotiation
In Gallia oft , and known unto their State .
Are th ' Ambassadors come with you ? San . Yes .
Well , bring 'em in , if they be firm and honest ,
Never had Men the means so to deserve
Of Rome as they . A happy wish 'd occasion ,
And thrust into my hands for the discovery ,
And manifest Conviction of these Traytors .
Be thank 'd , O Jupiter . My worthy Lords ,
Confederates of the Senate , you are welcom .
I understand by Quintius Fabius Sanga ,
Your careful Patron here , you have been lately
Sollicited against the Common-wealth
By one Umbrenus ( take a seat I pray you )
From Publius Lentulus , to be Associates
In their intended War . I could advise ,
That Men whose Fortunes are yet flourishing ,
And are Romes Friends , would not without a Cause
Become her Enemies ; and mix themselves
Or Lentulus , whose meer despair doth arm 'em :
That were to hazard Certainties for Air ,
And undergo all danger for a Voice .
Believe me Friends , loud Tumults are not laid
With half the easiness , that they are rais 'd .
All may begin a War , but few can end it .
The Senate have decreed , that my Colleague
And have declar 'd both him and Manlius Traytors .
Metellus Celer hath already given
Part of their Troops defeat . Honours are promis 'd
To all will quit 'em ; and Rewards propos 'd
Even to Slaves that can detect their Courses .
Here in the City , I have by the Pr?tors
And Tribunes , plac 'd my Guards and Watches so ,
That not a Foot can tread , a Breath can whisper ,
But I have knowledge . And be sure , the Senate
And People of Rome , of their accustom 'd Greatness ,
Will sharply and severely vindicate ,
Not only any Fact , but any Practice
Or Purpose 'gainst the State . Therefore my Lords ,
Consult of your own ways , and think which hand
Is best to take . You now are present Suitors
For some redress of wrongs ; I 'll undertake
Not only that shall be assur 'd you : but
What Grace , or Priviledge else , Senate or People ,
Can cast upou you worthy such a Service ,
As you have now the way and means to do 'em ,
If but your Wills consent with my Designs .
We covet nothing more , most worthy Consul .
And how so e 're we have been tempted lately
To a defection , that not makes us guilty :
We are not yet so wretched in our Fortunes ,
Nor in our Wills so lost , as to abandon
A friendship prodigally of that price ,
As is the Senate , and the People of Romes ,
For hopes that do precipitate themselves .
You then are wise and honest . Do but this then :
( When shall you speak with Lentulus and the rest ?
We are to meet anon at Brutus House .
Who ? Decius Brutus ? He is not in Rome .
O , but his Wife Sempronia . Cic . You instruct me ,
She is a chief . ) Well , fail not you to meet 'em ,
And to express the best Affection
You can put on , to all that they intend .
Like it , applaud it , give the Commonwealth
And Senate lost to 'em . Promise any Aids
By Arms or Counsel . What they can desire
I would have you prevent . Only say this ,
You have had dispatch in private by the Consul ,
Of your Affairs , and for the many fears
The State 's now in , you are will 'd by him this Evening ,
To depart Rome : which you by all sought means
Will do , of reason to decline suspicion .
Now for the more Authority of the business
They 'have trusted to you , and to give it Credit
With your own State at home , you would desire
Their Letters to your Senate and your People ,
Which shewn , you durst engage both Life and Honour ,
The rest should every way answer their hopes .
Those had , pretend sudden departure , you ,
And as you give me notice at what Port
You will go out , I 'll ha' you intercepted ,
And all the Letters taken with you : So
As you shall be Redeem 'd in all Opinions ,
And they convicted of their manifest Treason .
Ill Deeds are well turn 'd back upon their Authors :
And 'gainst an Injurer , the Revenge is just .
This must be done now . All . chearfully and firmly .
We 'are they would rather haste to undertake it ,
Than stay to say so . Cic . With that confidence , go :
Make your selves happy , while you make Rome so .
By Sanga , let me have notice from you . All . Yes .
WHen come these Creatures , the Ambassadors ?
I would fain see 'me . Are they any Scholars ?
I think not , Madam .
Ha' they no Greek ? Len . No surely .
Fie , what do I here ? waiting on 'em then ,
If they be nothing but meer States-men ? Len . Yes ,
Your Ladiship shall observe their Gravity ,
And their Reservedness , their many Cautions ,
Fitting their Persons . Sem . I do wonder much ,
That States and Common-wealths employ not Women
To be Ambassadors , sometimes ! we should
Do as good publick Service , and could make
As honourable Spies ( for so Thucidides
Calls all Ambassadors . ) Are they come , Cethegus ?
Do you ask me ? Am I your Scout or Bawd ?
O , Caius , it is no such business . Cet . No ?
What does a Woman at it then ? Sem . Good Sir ,
There are of us can be as exquisite Traytors ,
As e 're a Male-conspirator of you all .
I , at Smock-treason , Matron , I believe you ;
And if I were your Husband ; but when I
Trust to your Cob-web-bosoms any other ,
Let me there dye a Fly , and feast you , Spider .
You are too sowre , and harsh , Cethegus . Cet . You
Are kind and courtly . I'ld be torn in peices ,
With wild Hippolytus , nay prove the death
Every Limb over , e 're I'ld trust a Woman
With wind , could I retain it .
Sir , they 'll be trusted
With as good Secrets yet as you have any :
And carry 'em too as close and as conceal 'd ,
As you shall for your Heart .
I 'll not contend with you
Either in Tongue , or Carriage , good Calipso :
Th' Ambassadors are come .
Thanks to thee Mercury ,
That so hast rescu 'd me . Len . How now , Volturtius ?
They do desire some speech with you in private .
O ! 'tis about the Prophesie belike ,
And promise of the Sibylls . Gab . It may be .
Shun they to treat with me too ?
No good Lady ,
You may partake : I have told 'em who you are .
I should be loth to be left out , and here too .
Can these or such be any aids to us ?
Look they , as they were built to shake the World ,
Or be a moment to our Enterprise ?
A thousand such as they are could uot make
One Attom of our Souls . They should be Men
Worth Heavens fear , that looking up but thus
Would make Jove stand upon his Guard , and draw
Himself within his Thunder ; which amaz 'd ,
He should discharge in vain , and they unhurt .
Or if they were like Capaneus at Thebes ,
They should hang dead upon the highest Spires ,
And ask the second Bolt to be thrown down .
VVhy Lentulus talk you so long ? This time
Had been enough , t ' have scatter 'd all the Stars ,
T' have quench 'd the Sun and Moon , and made the World
Despair of day , or any light but ours .
How do you like this Spirit ? In such Men
Mankind doth live . They are such Souls as these
That move the VVorld . Sem . I , though he bear me hard ,
I yet must do him right . He is a Spirit
Of the right Martian breed . All . He is a Mars !
VVould we had time to live here and admire him .
VVell , I do see you would prevent the Consul .
And I commend your care : It was but reason ,
To ask our Letters , and we had prepar 'd them .
Go
Go in , and we will take an Oath , and seal 'em .
To visit him i' the way , and to confirm
The Association . This our Friend , Volturtius ,
Shall go along with you . Tell our great General
That we are ready here ; that Lucius Bestia
The Tribune is provideded of a Speech ,
To lay the envy of the War upon Cicero ;
That all but long for his approach and Person ;
And then you are made Free-men as our selves .
I Cannot fear the War but to succeed well ,
Both for the honour of the Cause , and worth
Of him that doth Command . For my Colleague ,
Being so ill affected with the Gout ,
Will not be able to be there in Person ;
And then Petreius , his Lieutenant , must
Of need take charge o ' the Army ; who is much
The better Soldier , having been a Tribune ,
These Thirty years , so conversant i' the Army ,
As he knows all the Soldiers by their Names .
They 'll fight then bravely with him .
I , and he
Will lead 'em on as bravely . Cic . They ' have a Foe
Will ask their Braveries , whose necessities
Will arm him like a Fury . But however
I 'll trust it to the Manage and the Fortune
Of good Petreius , who 's a worthy Patriot :
Metellus Celer , with three Legions too ,
Will stop their course for Gallia . How now Fabius ?
The Train hath taken . You must instantly
Dispose your Guards upon the Milvian Bridge :
For by that way they mean to come . Cic . Then thither
Pomtinius and Flaccus , I must pray you
To lead that force you have ; and seize them all :
Let not a Person scape . Th' Ambassadors
Will yield themselves . If there be any tumult ,
I 'll send you aid . I , in mean time , will call
Lentulus to me , Gabinius and Cethegus ,
By several Messengers : who no doubt will come
Without sense or suspicion . Prodigal Men
Feel not their own stock wasting . When I have 'em ,
I 'll place those Guards upon 'em , that they start not .
But what 'll you do with Sempronia ?
A States anger
Should not take knowledge either of Fools or Women .
I do not know whether my joy or care
Ought to be greater , that I have discover 'd
So foul a Treason , or must undergo
The envy of so many great Mens fate .
But happen what there can , I will be just ,
My Fortune may forsake me , not my Vertue :
That shall go with me , and before me still ,
And glad me doing well , though I hear ill .
F Stand , who goes there ?
We are th ' Allobroges ,
And Friends of Rome . Pom . If you be so , then yield
Your selves unto the Pr?tors , who in name
Of the whole Senate and the People of Rome ,
Yet , till you clear your selves , charge you of Practise
Against the State . Vol . Dye Friends , and be not taken .
What Voice is that ? Down with 'em all .
We yield .
What 's he stands out ? Kill him there .
Hold , hold , hold .
I yield upon Conditions . Fla . We give none
To Traitors , strike him down . Vol . My name 's Volturtius ,
I know Pomtinius . Pom . But he knows not you ,
While you stand out upon these trayterous Terms .
I 'll yield upon the safety of my Life .
If it be forfeited , we cannot save it .
Promise to do your best . I am not so guilty
As many others I can name ; and will ,
If you will grant me favour . Pom . All we can
Is to deliver you to the Consul . Take him ,
And thank the Gods that thus have saved Rome .
NOw do our Ears before our Eyes ,
Like men in Mists ,
Discover who 'ld the State surprise ,
And who resists ?
And as these Clouds do yield to light ,
Now do we see
Our Thoughts of things , how they did fight ,
Which seem 'd t 'agree ?
Of what strange Pieces are we made ,
Who nothing know ;
But as new Airs our Ears invade ,
Still censure so ?
That now do hope , and now do fear ,
And now envy ;
And then do hate , and then love dear ,
But know not why :
Or if we do , it is so late ,
As our best mood ,
Though true , is then thought out of date ,
And empty of good .
How have we chang 'd and come about
In every doome ,
And quitted Rome ?
One while we thought him innocent ;
And then w ' accus 'd
The Consul , for his malice spent ,
And power abus 'd .
Since that , we hear he is in Arms ,
We think not so :
Yet charge the Consul with our harms ,
That let him go .
So in our censure of the State ,
We still do wander ;
And make the careful Magistrate
The mark of slander .
What Age is this , where honest Men ,
Plac 'd at the Helm ,
A Sea of some foul Mouth or Pen ,
Shall over-whelm ?
And call their diligence deceit ;
Their vertue vice ;
Their watchfulness but lying in wait ;
And Blood the price .
O , let us pluck this evil Seed
Out of our Spirits ;
And give to every noble Deed
The name it merits .
Lest we seem faln ( if this endures )
Into those times ,
To love Disease ; and brook the Cures
Worse than the Crimes .

IT is my Fortune and my Glory , Soldiers ,
This day , to lead you on ; the worthy Consul
Kept from the honour of it by Disease :
And I am proud to have so brave a Cause
To exercise your Arms in . We not now
Fight for how long , how broad , how great , and large
Th' extent , and bounds o ' th ' People of Rome shall be ;
But to retain what our great Ancestors ,
For us , were purchasing so many years .
The quarrel is not now of Fame or Tribute ,
Or of wrongs done unto Confederates ,
For which the Army of the People of Rome
Was wont to move : but for your own Republick ,
For the rais 'd Temples of th ' immortal Gods ,
For all your Fortunes , Altars , and your Fires ,
For the dear Souls of your lov 'd Wives and Children ,
Your Parents Tombs , your Rites , Laws , Liberty ,
And briefly , for the safety of the World :
Against such Men , as only by their Crimes
Are known ; thrust out by Riot , Want , or Rashness .
One sort , Sylla 's old Troops , left here in Fesul? ,
Who suddenly made rich in those dire Times ,
Are since , by their unbounded vast expence ,
Grown needy and poor ; and have but left t ' expect
These Men ( they say ) are Valiant ; yet , I think 'em
Not worth your pause : For either their old Vertue
Is in their Sloth and Pleasures lost ; or , if
It tarry with 'em , so ill match for yours ,
As they are short in Number or in Cause .
The second sort are of those ( City-beasts ,
Rather than Citizens ) who whilst they reach
After our Fortunes , have let fly their own ;
These whelm 'd in Wine , swell 'd up with Meats , and weakned
With hourly whoredoms , never left the side
From his Embraces : such as ( trust me ) never
In riding or in using well their Arms ,
VVatching , or other Military Labour ,
Did exercise their Youth ; but learn 'd to Love ,
And these will wish more hurt to you than they bring you .
The rest are a mixt kind , all sorts of Furies ,
The Murderers of their Parents , all the Sink
And Plague of Italy met in one Torrent ,
To take , to day , from us the Punishment ,
Due to their mischiefs , for so many years .
And who in such a Cause , 'gainst such Fiends ,
VVould not now wish himself all Arm and VVeapon ?
To cut such Poysons from the Earth , and let
Their Blood out to be drawn away in Clouds ,
And pour 'd on some inhabitable Place ,
Where the hot Sun and Slime breeds nought but Monsters ?
Chiefly when this sure joy shall crown our side ,
That the least Man that falls upon our Party
This day ( as some must give their happy Names
To Fate , and that eternal Memory
Of the best Death , writ with it , for their Countrey )
Shall walk at pleasure in the Tents of rest ;
And see far off , beneath him , all their Host
Walking a wretched and less Ghost than he .
I 'll urge no more : Move forward with your Eagles ,
And trust the Senates and Romes Cause to Heaven .
To thee , great Father Mars , and greater Jove .
C?sar , Crassus .
I Ever look 'd for this of Lentulus ,
Many days since . C?s . But , wherefore did you bear
Their Letter to the Consul , that they sent you
To warn you from the City ? Cra . Did I know
Whether he made it ? It might come from him ,
For ought I could assure me : if they meant
I should be safe among so many , they might
Have come as well as writ . C?s . There is no loss
In being secure . I have of late too ply 'd him
Thick with Intelligences , but they have been
Of things he knew before . Cra . A little serves
To keep a Man upright on these State-bridges ,
Although the Passage were more dangerous .
Let us now take the standing part . C?s . We must ,
And be as zealous for't , as Cato . Yet ,
I would fain help these wretched Men . Cra . You cannot .
Who would save them , that have betrayd themselves ?
I Will not be wrought to it , Brother Quintus .
There 's no Mans private enmity shall make
Me violate the Dignity of another .
If there were Proof 'gainst C?sar , or who ever ,
To speak him guilty , I would so declare him .
But Quintus Catulus , and Piso both
Shall know , the Consul will not , for their grudge ,
Have any Man accus 'd or named falsly .
Not falsly : but if any Circumstance ,
By the Allobroges , or from Volturtius ,
Would carry it . Cic . That shall not be sought by me .
If it reveal it self , I would not spare
Good Marcus Tullius ( which is more than great )
Thou hadst thy Education with the Gods .
Send Lentulus forth , and bring away the rest .
This Office I am sorry , Sir , to do you .
The Senate .
WHat may be happy still and fortunate ,
To Rome , and to this Senate : Please you , Fathers ,
To break these Letters , and to view them round .
If that be not found in them , which I fear ,
I yet intreat at such a time as this ,
My diligence be not contemn 'd . Ha' you brought
The Weapons hither from Cethegus House ?
They are without . Cic . Be ready with Volturtius ,
To bring him when the Senate calls ; and see
None of the rest confer together . Fathers ,
What do you read ? Is it yet worth your care ,
If not your fear , what you find practis 'd there ?
It hath a Face of horror ! Cra . I am amaz 'd !
Loook there .
Gods ! Can such Men draw common Air ?
Although the greatness of the mischief , Fathers ,
Hath often made my Faith small in this Senate ,
I do not fear the envy of the Word ,
Unless the Deed be rather to be fear 'd ,
That he went hence alive ; when those I meant
Should follow him , did not ) I have spent both days
And nights in watching what their fury and rage
Was bent on , that so staid against my thought :
And that I might but take 'em in that light ,
Where when you met their Treason with your Eyes ,
Your minds at length would think for your own safety .
And now 'tis done . There are their Hands and Seals .
Their Persons too are safe , thanks to the Gods .
Bring in Volturtius and the Allobroges .
These be the Men were trusted with their Letters .
Fathers , believe me , I knew nothing : I
Was travelling for Gallia , and am sorry ? ?
Quake not Volturtius , speak the truth , and hope
Well of this Senate , on the Consuls word .
Then I knew all . But truly I was drawn in
But t 'other day . C?s . Say what thou know 'st , and fear not .
Thou hast the Senates , Faith and Consuls word
To fortifie thee . Vol . I was sent with Letters ?
And had a Message too ? from Lentulus ?
To
Servants , or others ? and come with his Army ,
As soon unto the City as he could ?
For they were ready , and but staid for him ?
To intercept those that should flee the Fire ?
These Men ( the Allobroges ) did hear it too .
Yes , Fathers , and they took an Oath to us ,
Besides their Letters , that we should be free ;
And urg 'd us for some present aid of Horse .
Nay , here be other Testimonies , Fathers ,
Cethegus Armoury . Cra . What , not all these ?
Here 's not the hundred Part . Call in the Fencer ,
That we may know the Arms to all these Weapons .
Come my brave Sword-player , to what active use
Was all this Steel provided ? Cet . Had you ask 'd
In Sylla 's days , it had been to cut Throats ;
But now it was to look on only : I lov 'd
To see good Blades , and feel their Edge , and Points ,
To put a Helm upon a Block , and cleave it ,
And now and then to stab an Armour through .
Know you that Paper ? That will stab you through .
Is it your hand ? Hold , save the pieces . Traytor ,
Hath thy guilt wak 'd thy Fury ? Cet . I did write
I know not what ; nor care not : That Fool Lentulus
Did dictate , and I t 'other Fool did sign it .
Bring in Statilius : Does he know his hand too ?
And Lentulus . Reach him that Letter . Sta . I
Confess it all . Cic . Know you that seal yet , Publius ?
Yes , it is mine . Cic . Whose Image is that on it ?
My Grand-fathers .
What , that renown 'd good Man ,
That did so only embrace his Countrey , and lov 'd
His fellow Citizens ! Was not his Picture ,
Though mute , of Power to call thee from a Fact
So foul ? Len . As what , impetuous Cicero ?
As thou art , for I do not know what 's fouler .
Look upon these . Do not these Faces argue
Thy guilt and impudence ? Len . What are these to me ?
I know 'em not . All . No, Publius ? we were with you
At Brutus House . Vol . Last night .
What did you there ?
Who sent for you ? All . Your self did . We had Letters
From you , Cethegus , this Statilius here ,
Gabinius Cimber , all but from Longinus ,
Who would not write , because he was to come
Shortly in Person after us ( he said )
To take the charge o ' the Horse , which we should levy .
Spies ? Spies ? All . You told us too o ' the Sybils Books ,
And how you were to be a King this year ,
The Twentieth from the burning of the Capitol ,
That three Cornellii were to Raign in Rome ,
Of which you were the last : and prais 'd Cethegus ,
These are your honourable Ambassadors ,
My Soveraign Lord . Cat . Peace , that too bold Cethegus .
Besides Gabinius , your Agent nam 'd
Autronius , Servius Sylla , Vargunteius ,
And divers others . Vol . I had Letters from you
Unto the Senate truly word for word :
For which I hope they will be gracious to me .
I was drawn in by that same wicked Cimber ,
And thought no hurt at all . Cic . Volturtius , peace .
Where is thy Visor or thy Voice now Lentulus ?
Art thou confounded ? Wherefore speak 'st thou not ?
Is all so clear , so plain , so manifest ,
That both thy Eloquence and Impudence ,
And thy ill Nature too , have left thee at once ?
Take him aside . There 's yet one more , Gabinius ,
The Engineer of all . Shew him that Paper ,
If he do know it ? Gab . I know nothing . Cic . No ?
No. Neither will I know . Cat . Impudent Head !
Stick it into his Throat ; were I the Consul ,
Il 'd make thee eat the mischief thou hast vented .
Is there a Law for't , Cato ? Cat . Dost thou ask
After a Law , that would 'st have broke all Laws
Of Nature , Manhood , Conscience , and Religion ?
Yes I may ask for't . Cat . No, pernicions Cimber .
Th' inquiring after good does not belong
Unto a wicked Person . Gab . I , but Cato
Does nothing but by Law . Cra . Take him aside .
There 's Proof enough though he confess not . Gab . Stay ,
I will confess . All 's true your Spies have told you ,
Make much of 'em . Cet . Yes , and reward 'em well ,
For fear you get no more such . See they do not
Dye in a Ditch , and stink now you ha' done with 'em ;
Or beg o ' the Bridges here in Rome , whose Arches
Their active industry hath sav 'd . Cic . See Fathers
What Minds and Spirits these are , that being convicted
Of such a Treason , and by such a Cloud
Of Witnesses , dare yet retain their boldness ?
What would their Rage have done , if they had conquer 'd ?
Neither the State nor I should need t ' have fear 'd
Lentulus sleep here , or Longinus fat ,
Or this Cethegus rashness ; it was he
I only watch 'd , while he was in our Walls ,
As one that had the Brain , the Hand , the Heart .
But now we find the contrary ! Where was there
A People griev 'd , or a State discontent ,
Able to make or help a War 'gainst Rome ,
But these , th ' Allobroges , and those they found ?
Whom had not the just Gods been pleas 'd to make
More Friends unto our safety than their own ,
As it then seem 'd , neglecting these Mens offers ,
Where had we been ? or where the Commonwealth ?
When their great Chief had been call 'd home ; this Man ,
Their absolute King ( whose noble Grand-father ,
Arm 'd in pursuit of the seditious Gracchus ,
Took a brave wound for dear defence of that
Which he would spoil ) had gather 'd all his Aids
Of Ruffians , Slaves , and other Slaughter-men ?
Given us up for murder to Cethegus ?
The other rank of Citizens to Gabinius ?
The City to be fir 'd by Cassius ?
And Italy , nay the World , to be laid wast
Lay but the thought of it before you Fathers ,
Think but with me you saw his glorious City ,
The Light of all the Earth , Tower of all Nations ,
Suddenly falling in one Flame . Imagine
You view 'd your Countrey buried with the heaps
Of slaughter 'd Citizens that had no Grave ;
This Lentulus here , raigning , ( as he dreamt )
With his fierce Army ; and the cries of Matrons ,
The flight of Children , and the rape of Virgins ,
Shriekes of the living , with the dying Groans
On every side t ' invade your Sense ; until
The Blood of Rome were mixed with her Ashes !
This was the Spectacle these Fiends intended
To please their Malice . Cet . I , and it would
Have been a brave one , Consul . But your Part
Had not then been so long as now it is :
I should have quite defeated your Oration ,
And slit that fine rhetorical Pipe of yours
I ' the first Scene . Cat . Insolent Monster ! Cic . Fathers ,
Is it your Pleasures they shall be committed
Unto some safe , but a free Custody ,
Until the Senate can determine farther ?
It pleaseth well . Cic . Then Marcus Crassus ,
Take you charge of Gabinius : send him home
Unto your House . You C?sar , of Statilius .
Cethegus shall be sent to Cornificius :
And Lentulus to Publius Lentulus Spinther ,
Who now is ?dile . Cat . It were best , the Pr?tors
Carried
Carried 'em to their Houses , and deliver 'd 'em .
Let it be so . Take 'em from hence . C?s . But first
Let Lentulus put off his Pr?torship .
I do resign it here unto the Senate .
So , now there 's no Offence done to Religion .
C?sar , 'twas piously and timely urg 'd .
What do you decree to th ' Allobroges ,
That were the Lights to this Discovery ?
A free Grant from the State , of all their Suits .
And a Reward out of the Publick Treasure .
I , and the Title of Honest Men , to crown 'em .
What to Volturtius ? C?s . Life , and Favour 's well .
I ask no more . Cat . Yes , yes , some Mony , thou needst it :
' Twill keep thee honest ; want made thee a Knave .
Let Flaccus , and Pomtinius , the Pr?tors ,
Have publick Thanks , and Quintus Fabius Sanga ,
For their good Service . Cra . They deserve it all .
But what do we decree unto the Consul ,
Whose Vertue , Counsel , Watchfulness , and Wisdom
Hath freed the Commonwealth , and without Tumult ,
Slaughter , or Blood , or scarce raising a Force ,
Rescu 'd us all out of the Jaws of Fate ?
VVe owe our Lives unto him , and our Fortunes .
Our VVives , our Children , Parents , and our Gods .
VVe all are saved by his Fortitude .
The Commonwealth owes him a Civick Garland .
He is the only Father of his Country .
Let there be Publick Prayer , to all the Gods ,
Made in that Name , for him . Cra . And in these words :
For that he hath , by his Vigilance , preserv 'd
Rome from the Flame , the Senate from the Sword ,
And all her Citizens from Massacre .
How are my Labours more than paid , grave Fathers ,
In these great Titles , and decreed Honours !
Such as to me , first of the Civil Robe ,
Of any Man since Rome was Rome , have hapned ;
And from this frequent Senate ; which more glads me ,
That I now see yo ' have sense of your own safety .
If those good days come no less grateful to us ,
Wherein we are preserv 'd from some great Danger ,
Than those wherein w ' are born , and brought to light ,
Because the gladness of our Safety is certain ,
But the condition of our Birth not so ;
And that w ' are sav 'd with pleasure , but are born
Without the sense of Joy : Why should not then
This Day , to us , and all Posterity
Of ours , be had in equal Fame and Honour ,
With that when Romulus first rear 'd these Walls ,
When so much more is saved , than he built ?
It ought . Cra . Let it be added to our Fasti .
What Tumult 's that ?
Here 's one Tarquinius taken ,
By Marcus Crassus , whom he names to be
Guilty of the Conspiracy . Cic . Some lying Varlet .
Take him away to Prison . Cra . Bring him in ,
And let me see him . Cic . He is not worth it , Crassus .
Keep him up close , and hungry , till he tell
By whose pernicious Counsel he durst slander
So great and good a Citizen . ( Cra . By yours ,
I fear , 'twill prove . ) Syl . Some o ' the Traitors , sure ,
Name you , or any Man . Cic . I know my self ,
By all the Tracts and Courses of this Business ,
Crassus is noble , just , and loves his Country .
Here is a Libel too , accusing C?sar ,
From Lucius Vectius , and confirm 'd by Curius .
Away with all , throw it out o ' the Court .
A Trick on me too ? Cic . It is some mens malice .
I said to Curius , I did not believe him .
Was not that Curius your Spy , that had
Reward decreed unto him the last Senate ,
With Fulvia , upon your private Motion ?
Yes .
But he has not that Reward yet ? Cic . No.
Let not this trouble you , C?sar ; none believes it .
It shall not , if that he have no Reward .
But if he have , sure I shall think my self
Very untimely and unsafely honest ,
Where such as he is may have Pay t ' accuse me .
You shall have no wrong done you , noble C?sar ,
But all Contentment . C?s . Consul , I am silent .
I Never yet knew , Soldiers , that in Fight
Words added Vertue unto valiant Men ;
Or , that a General 's Oration made
An Army fall or stand : But how much Prowess ,
Habitual or natural , each Mans Breast
Was Owner of , so much in act it shew 'd .
Whom neither Glory ' or Danger can excite ,
' Tis vain t ' attempt with Speech ; for the Minds fear
Keeps all brave Sounds from entring at that Ear .
I yet would warn you some few things , my Friends ,
And give you Reason of my present Counsels .
You know , no less than I , what State , what Point
Our Affairs stand in ; and you all have heard
What a calamitous Misery the Sloth
And Sleepiness of Lentulus hath pluck 'd
Both on himself , and us ; how , whilst our Aids
There , in the City look 'd for , are defeated ;
Our entrance into Gallia too is stopt :
Two Armies wait us ; one from Rome , the other
From the Gaul-Provinces : And where we are ,
( Although I most desire it ) the great want
Of Corn and Victuals forbids longer stay .
So that of need we must remove ; but whither ,
The Sword must both direct , and cut the Passage .
I only therefore wish you , when you strike ,
To have your Valours and your Souls about you ,
And think you carry in your labouring Hands
The things you seek , Glory , and Liberty ,
Your Country , which you want now , with the Fates ,
That are to be instructed by our Swords .
If we can give the Blow , all will be safe to us .
We shall not want Provision , nor Supplies .
The Colonies and Free Towns will lie open ;
Where , if we yield to fear , expect no Place ,
Nor Friend , to shelter those whom their own Fortune ,
And ill-us 'd Arms have left without Protection .
You might have liv 'd in Servitude , or Exile ,
Or safe at Rome , depending on the Great ones ;
But that you thought those things unfit for Men :
And , in that thought , you then were valiant .
For no Man ever yet chang 'd Peace for War ,
But he that meant to conquer . Hold that purpose .
There 's more necessity you should be such ,
In fighting for your selves , than they for others .
He 's base that trusts his Feet , whose Hands are arm 'd .
Me thinks I see Death and the Furies waiting
What we will do , and all the Heav'n at leisure
For the great Spectacle . Draw then your Swords ;
And if our Destiny envy our Vertue
The Honour of the Day , yet let us care
To sell our selves at such a Price as may
Undo the World to buy us , and make Fate ,
While she tempts ours , fear her own Estate .
The Senate .
S What means this hasty calling of the Senate ?
We shall know streight . Wait till the Consul speaks .
Fathers Conscript , bethink you of your Safeties ,
And what to do with these Conspirators :
Some of their Clients , their Freed-men , and Slaves ,
' Gin to make Head : There is one of Lentulus Bawds
Runs up and down the Shops , through every Street ,
With
With Money , to corrupt the poor Artificers ,
And needy Tradesmen , to their aid . Cethegus
Hath sent too to his Servants , who are many ,
Chosen , and exercis 'd in bold Attemptings ,
That forthwith they should arm themselves , and prove
His Rescue : All will be in instant Uproar ,
If you prevent it not with present Counsels .
We have done what we can to meet the Fury ,
And will do more . Be you good to your selves .
What is your pleasure , Fathers , shall be done ?
Syllanus , you are Consul next design 'd ;
Your Sentence of these Men . Syl . ' Tis short , and this .
Since they have sought to blot the name of Rome
Out of the World , and raze this glorious Empire
With her own Hands , and Arms turn 'd on her self ,
I think it fit they die : And could my Breath
Now execute 'em , they should not enjoy
An Article of Time , or Eye of Light ,
Longer , to poyson this our Common air .
I think so too .
And I. And I. And I.
Your Sentence , Caius C?sar .
Conscript Fathers ,
In great Affairs , and doubtful , it behoves
Men that are ask 'd their Sentence , to be free
From either Hate or Love , Anger or Pity :
For where the least of these do hinder , there
The Mind not easily discerns the Truth .
I speak this to you in the Name of Rome ,
For whom you stand ; and to the present Cause :
That this foul Fact of Lentulus , and the rest ,
Weigh not more with you than your Dignity ;
And you be more indulgent to your Passion ,
Than to your Honour . If there could be found
A Pain or Punishment equal to their Crimes ,
I would devise , and help : But if the greatness
Of what they ha' done , exceed all Mans Invention ,
I think it fit to stay where our Laws do .
Poor petty States may alter , upon humour ,
Where , if th ' offend with anger , few do know it ,
Because they are obscure ; their Fame and Fortune
Is equal , and the same . But they that are
Head of the World , and live in that seen height ,
The greater Fortune hath the lesser Licence .
They must not favour , hate , and least be angry :
For what with others is call 'd Anger , there
Is Cruelty and Pride . I know Syllanus ,
Who spoke before me , a just , valiant Man ,
A Lover of the State , and one that would not ,
In such a Business , use or Grace or Hatred ;
I know too , well , his Manners and Modesty :
Nor do I think his Sentence cruel , ( for
' Gainst such Delinquents what can be too bloody ? )
But that it is abhorring from our State :
Since to a Citizen of Rome , offending ,
Our Laws give Exile , and not Death . Why then
Decrees he that ? ' Twere vain to think , for fear ;
When , by the diligence of so worthy a Consul ,
All is made safe and certain . Is't for Punishment ?
Why , Death 's the end of Evils , and a Rest ,
Rather than Torment : It dissolves all Griefs ;
And beyond that , is neither Care nor Joy .
You hear , my Sentence would not have 'em die .
So will they , being but banish 'd . No, Grave Fathers ,
I judge 'em , first , to have their States confiscate ;
Then , that their Persons remain Prisoners
I ' the Free Towns , far off from Rome , and sever 'd ;
Where they might neither have Relation ,
Hereafter , to the Senate , or the People .
Or , if they had , those Towns then to be mulcted ,
As Enemies to the State , that had their Guard .
' Tis good and honourable , C?sar hath utter 'd .
Fathers , I see your Faces and your Eyes
All bent on me , to note , of these two Censures ,
Which I incline to . Either of them are grave ,
And answering the Dignity of the Speakers ,
The greatness of th ' Affair , and both severe .
One urgeth Death ; and he may well remember
This State hath punish 'd wicked Citizens so .
The other Bonds , and those perpetual , which
He thinks found out for the more singular Plague .
Decree which you shall please : You have a Consul ,
Not readier to obey , than to defend
Whatever you shall act , for the Republick ;
And meet with willing Shoulders any Burden ,
Or any Fortune , with an even Face ,
Though it were Death ; which to a valiant Man
Can never happen foul , nor to a Consul
Be immature , or to a wise man wretched .
Fathers , I spake but as I thought the Needs
O' th ' Commonwealth requir 'd . Cat . Excuse it not .
Cato , speak your Sentence . Cat . This it is .
You here dispute on kinds of Punishment ,
And stand consulting what you should decree
' Gainst those of whom you rather should beware :
This Mischief is not like those common Facts ,
Which , when they are done , the Laws may prosecute .
But this , if you provide not ere it happen ,
When it is hap'ned , will not wait your Judgment .
Good Caius C?sar here hath very well ,
And subtilly discours 'd of Life and Death ,
As if he thought those things a pretty Fable ,
That are deliver 'd us of Hell and Furies ,
Or of the divers way that ill Men go
From good , to filthy , dark , and ugly Places .
And therefore he would have these live , and long too ;
But far from Rome , and in the small Free Towns ,
Lest here they might have Rescue : As if Men
And not throughout all Italy ; or , that Boldness
Could not do more , where it found least resistance ?
' Tis a vain Counsel , if he think them dangerous :
Which if he do not , but that he alone ,
In so great fear of all Men , stand unfrighted ,
He gives me cause , and you , more to fear him .
I am plain , Fathers . Here you look about
One at another , doubting what to do ;
With Faces , as you trusted to the Gods ,
That still have sav 'd you ; and they can do 't : But
They are not Wishings , or base womanish Prayers ,
Which they will be ashamed to forsake .
' Tis Sloth they hate , and Cowardise . Here you have
The Traitors in your Houses ; yet you stand ,
Fearing what to do with 'em : Let 'em loose ,
And send 'em hence with Arms too , that your Mercy
May turn your Misery , as soon as't can .
O , but they are Great Men , and have offended
But through Ambition : We would spare their Honour .
I , if themselves had spar 'd it , or their Fame ,
Or Modesty , or either God , or Man :
Then I would spare 'em . But as things now stand ,
Fathers , to spare these Men , were to commit
A greater Wickedness than you would revenge .
If there had been but time and Place for you
To have repair 'd this Fault , you should have made it ;
It should have been your Punishment , to have felt
Your tardy Error : but Necessity
Now bids me say , Let 'em not live an Hour ,
If you mean Rome should live a Day . I have done .
Cato hath spoken like an Oracle .
Let it be so decreed . Sen. We are all fearful .
And had been base , had not his Vertue rais 'd us .
Go forth , most worthy Consul . we 'll assist you .
I am not yet chang 'd in my Sentence , Fathers .
No matter . What be those ? Sen. Letters for C?sar .
From
From whom ? Let 'em be read in open Senate .
Fathers , they come from the Conspirators ;
I crave to have 'em read , for the Republick .
Cato , read you it . ' Tis a Love-letter ,
From your dear Sister , to me : though you hate me ,
Do not discover it . Cat . Hold thee , Drunkard . Consul ,
Go forth , and confidently . C?s . You 'll repent
This rashness , Cicero . Pr? . C?sar shall repent it .
Hold , Friends .
He 's scarce a Friend unto the Publick .
No violence . C?sar , be safe . Lead on .
Where are the Publick Executioners ?
Bid 'em wait on us . On to Spinther 's House .
Bring Lentulus forth . Here , you , the sad Revengers
Of Capital Crimes against the Publick , take
This Man unto your Justice ; strangle him .
Thou dost well , Consul . ' Twas a Cast at Dice ,
In Fortune 's Hand , not long since , that thy self
Should 'st have heard these , or other words as fatal .
Lead on to Quintus Cornificius House .
Bring forth Cethegus . Take him to the due
Death that he hath deserv 'd , and let it be
Said , he was once . Cet . A Beast , or , what is worse ,
A Slave , Cethegus . Let that be the Name
For all that 's base , hereafter ; that would let
This Worm pronounce on him , and not have trampled
His Body into ? Ha ! art thou not mov 'd ?
Justice is never angty . Take him hence .
O , the Whore Fortune , and her Bawds the Fates !
That put these Tricks on Men , whick knew the way
To Death by ' a Sword . Strangle me , I may sleep;
I shall grow angry with the Gods else . Cic . Lead
To Caius C?sar , for Statilius .
Bring him , and rude Gabinius out . Here , take 'em
To your cold Hands , and let 'em feel Death from you .
I thank you , you do me a pleasure .
And me too .
So , Marcus Tullius , thou maist now stand up ,
And call it happy Rome , thou being Consul .
Great Parent of thy Country , go , and let
The old Men of the City , ere they die ,
Kiss thee ; the Matrons dwell about thy Neck ;
The Youths and Maids lay up , 'gainst they are old ,
What kind of Man thou wert , to tell their Nephews ,
When , such a Year , they read , within our Fasti ,
Thy Consulship . Who 's this ? Petreius ? Cic . Welcome ,
Welcome , renowned Soldier . VVhat 's the News ?
This Face can bring no ill with't unto Rome .
How does the worthy Consul , my Colleague ?
As well as Victory can make him , Sir .
He greets the Fathers , and to me hath trusted
The sad Relation of the Civil Strife ;
For , in such VVar , the Conquest still is black .
Shall we withdraw into the House of Concord ?
No, happy Consul : Here let all Ears take
The Benefit of this Tale . If he had Voice
To spread unto the Poles , and strike it through
The Center , to th ' Antipodes , it would ask it .
As he must fight with one of the two Armies ,
That then had neer enclos 'd him ; it pleas 'd Fate
To make us th ' Object of his desperate Choice ,
VVherein the Danger almost poiz 'd the Honour :
And as he riss' , the Day grew black with him ,
And Fate descended nearer to the Earth ,
As if she meant to hide the name of things
Under her VVings , and make the VVorld her Quarry .
