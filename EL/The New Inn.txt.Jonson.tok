The SCENE
B A R N E T.
The P E R S O N S of the PLAY .
He pretends to be a
Gentleman and a Scholar , neglected by
the Times , turns Host , and keeps an Inn ,
the Sign of the Light Heart in Barnet : is supposed
to have one only Son , but is found to have none , but
two Daughters , Frances and L?titia , who was lost
young , &c .
A compleat Gentleman , a Soldier and a
Scholar , is a melancholy Guest in the Inn : first quar-
rell 'd , after much honour 'd and belov 'd by the Host .
He is known to have been Page to the old Lord Beau -
fort , follow 'd him in the French Wars , after a Com -
panion of his Studies , and left Guardian to his Son .
He is assisted in his Love to the Lady Frampul , by the
Host , and the Chambermaid Prudence .
He was one
that acted well too .
Who is also called Stote and Vermin , is
Lovel 's Servant , a Fellow of a quick nimble Wit ,
knows the Manners and Affections of People , and can
make profitable and timely discoveries of them .
Suppos 'd a Boy , and the Hosts Son , bor-
rowed to be drest for a Lady , and set up as a stale by
Prudence , to catch Beaufort or Latimer , proves to
be L?tita , Sister to Frances , and Lord Frampul 's
younger Daughter , stoln by a Beggar-woman , shorn ,
put into Boys Apparel , sold to the Host , and brought up
by him as his Son .
A poor Chair-woman in the Inn , with one
Eye , that tends the Boy , is thought the Irish Beggar
that sold him , but is truly the Lady Frampul , who left
her home melancholick , and jealous that her Lord lov 'd
her not , because she brought him none but Daughters ,
and lives unknown to her Husband , as he to her .
Supposed the Lady Frampul , being repu-
ted his sole Daughter and Heir , the Barony descend -
ing upon her , is a Lady of great Fortunes , and Beau -
ty , but phantastical : thinks nothing a felicity , but to
have a multitude of Servants , and be call 'd Mistress
by them , comes to the Inn to be merry , with a Chamber-
maid only , and her Servants her Guests , &c .
The Chamber-maid is elected Sove-
reign of the Sports in the Inn , Governs all , Commands ,
and so orders , as the Lord Latimer is exceedingly ta -
ken with her , and takes her to his Wife , in conclusion .
Lord Latimer and Lord Beaufort , are a pair of
young Lords , Servants and Guests to the Lady Fram -
pul , but as Latimer falls enamour 'd of Prudence , so
doth Beaufort on the Boy , the Hosts Son , set up for L? -
titia , the younger Sister , which she proves to be indeed .
Sir Glorious Tipto .
A Knight , and Colonel , hath
the luck to think well of himself , without a Rival ,
talks gloriously of any thing , but very seldom is in the
He is the Ladies Guest , and her Servant too ;
but this day utterly neglects his Service , or that him .
For he is so enamour 'd on the Fly of the Inn , and the
Militia below Stairs , with Hodge Huffle , and Bat
Burst , Guests that come in , and Trundle , Barnabe ,
as no other Society relisheth with him .
Is the Parasite of the Inn , Visiter general of
the House , one that had been a strolling Gipsee , but
now is reclam 'd , to be Inflamer of the Reckonings .
The Drawer , Knighted by the Colonel ,
stil 'd Sir Pierce , and young Anone , one of the
chief of the Infantry .
The Chamberlain , another of the Militia ,
and an Officer , Commands the Tertia of the Beds .
The Tapster , a Through-fare of News .
The Hostler .
Bat Burst .
A broken Citizen , an in and in Man .
Hodge Huffle .
A Cheater , his Champion .
Nick Stuff .
The Ladies Taylor .
Pinnacia Stuff .
His Wife .
A Coachman .
A hir 'd Coachman .
The Smith .
The Sadler .
} Only talk 'd on .
The P R O L O G U E.
YOu are welcome , welcome all to the New Inn ;
Though the old House , we hope our Chear will win
Your Acceptaion : we ha' the same Cook
Still , and the fat , who says , you sha' not look
Long for your Bill of Fare , but every Dish
Be serv 'd in i' the time , and to your wish :
If any thing be set to a wrong taste ,
' Tis not the Meat , there , but the Mouth 's displac 'd ,
Remove but that sick Palate , all is well .
For this , the secure Dresser bad me tell ,
Nothing more hurts just Meetings , than a Croud ;
Or , when the Expectation 's grown too loud :
That the nice Stomach would ha' this or that ,
And being ask 'd , or urg 'd , it knows not what :
When sharp or sweet , have been too much a Feast ,
And both out liv 'd the Palate of the Guest .
Beware to bring such Appetites to the Stage ,
They do confess a weak , sick , queasie Age ;
And a shrew 'd grudging too of Ignorance ,
When Clothes and Faces 'bove the Men advance :
Hear for your Health , then , But at any hand ,
Before you judge , vouchsafe to understand ,
Concoct , digest : if then , it do not hit ,
Some are in a Consumption of Wit ,
Deep , he dares say , he will not think , that all --
For Hecticks are not Epidemical .

Nor is my House pleas 'd , if my Sign could speak ,
The Sign o ' the Light-Heart .
There you may
read it ;
So may your Master too , if he look on't .
A Heart weigh 'd with a Feather , and out weigh 'd too :
A Brain-child o ' my own ! and I am proud on't !
And if his Worship think , here , to be melancholy ,
In spight of me or my Wit , he is deceiv 'd ;
I will maintain the Rebus 'gainst all Humours ,
And all Complexions i' the Body of Man ,
That 's my word , or i' the Isle of Britain !
You have Reason good mine Host .
Sir I have Rhime too .
Whether it be by chance or Art ,
A heavy Purse makes a light Heart .
There 'tis exprest ! first , by a Purse of Gold ,
A heavy Purse , and then two Turtles , makes ,
A Heart with a Light stuck in't , a Light-heart !
Old Abbot Islip could not invent better ,
Or Prior Bolton with his Bolt and Ton .
I am an Inn-keeper , and know my Grounds ,
And study 'em ; Brain o ' Man , I study 'em :
I must ha' jovial Guests to drive my Ploughs ,
And whistling Boys to bring my Harvest home ,
Or I shall hear no Flails thwack .
Here , your Master
And you ha' been this Fortnight , drawing Fleas
Out of my Mats , and pounding 'em in Cages
Cut out of Cards , and those rop 'd round with Pack-thred ,
Drawn thorow Birdlime ! a fine subtilty !
Or poring through a Multiplying-glass ,
Upon a captiv 'd Crab-louse , or a Cheese-mite
To be dissected , as the Sports of Nature ,
With a neat Spanish Needle ! Speculations
That do become the Age , I do confess !
As measuring an Ants Eggs , with the Silk-worms ,
By a Phantastick Instrument of Thred ,
Shall give you their just difference to a Hair !
Or else recovering o ' dead Flies with Crums !
( Another quaint conclusion i' the Physicks )
Which I ha' seen you busie at , through the Key-hole ?
But never had the Fate to see a Fly ? ? ?
Alive i' your Cups , or once heard , drink mine Host ,
Or such a chearful chirping Charm come from you .
what 's that ?
A buzzing of mine Host
About a Fly ! a murmur that he has .
Sir I am telling your Stote here , Monsieur Ferret ,
( For that I hear 's his Name ) and dare tell you , Sir ,
If you have a mind to be melancholy , and musty ,
There 's Footmans Inn , at the Towns end , the Stocks ,
Or Carriers Place , at Sign o ' the broken Wain ,
Mansions of State ! Take up your Harbour there ,
There are both Flies and Fleas , and all variety
Of Vermin , for inspection or dissection .
We ha' set our rest up here , Sir , i' your Heart .
Sir set your Heart at rest , you shall not do it :
Unless you can be jovial .
Brain o ' Man ,
Be jovial first , and drink , and dance , and drink .
Your lodging here , and wi' your daily dumps ,
Is a meer Libel 'gain my House and me ;
And , then , your scandalous Commons .
How , mine Host ?
Sir , they do scandal me , upo ' the Road , here .
A poor quotidian Rack o ' Mutton , roasted
Dry to be grated ! and that driven down
With Bear and Butter-Milk , mingled together ,
Or clarified Whey instead of Claret !
It is against my Free-hold , my Inheritance ,
My Magna Charta , Cor l?tificat ,
To drink such Balder-dash , or Bonny-clabbee !
Gi' me good Wine , or Catholick , or Christian ,
Wine is the Word that glads the Heart of Man :
And mine 's the House of Wine , Sack , says my Bush ,
Be merry , and drink Sherry ; that 's my Poesie !
For I shall never joy i' my Light-heart ,
So long as I conceive a sullen Guest ,
Or any thing that 's earthy ! Lov.
Humorous Host .
I care not if I be .
But airy also ,
Not to defraud you of your Rights , or trench
Upo ' your Privileges , or great Charter ,
( For those are every Hostlers Language now )
Say , you were born beneath those smiling Stars ,
Have made you Lord , and owner of the Heart ,
Of the Light-heart in Barnet ; suffer us
Who are more Saturnine , t ' enjoy the Shade
Of your round Roof yet .
Sir I keep no Shades
Nor Shelters , I : for either Owls or Rere-mice .
Bless you Child ,
You 'll make your selves such .
That your Son , mine Host ? { En .
( the Host speaks
to his Child o ' the by .
He 's all the Sons I have , Sir . Lov.
Pretty Boy !
Goes he to School ?
O Lord , Sir , he prates Latin
And 'twere a Parrot , or a Play-boy .
Thou ? ?
Commend 'st him fitly .
To the pitch , he flies , Sir ,
He 'll tell you what is Latin for a Looking-glass ,
A Beard-brush , Rubber , or Quick-warming Pan .
What 's that ?
a Wench , i' the Inn-phrase , is all these ;
{ A Looking-Glass in her Eye ,
A Beard-brush with her Lips ,
A Rubber with her Hand ,
And a Warming-pan with her Hips .
This , in your scurril Dialect .
But my Inn
Knows no such Language .
That 's because , mine Host ,
You do profess the teaching him your self .
Sir ,
Sir , I do teach him somewhat .
By degrees ,
And with a Funnel , I make shift to fill
The narrow Vessel , he is but yet a Bottle .
O let him lose no time though .
Sir , he do 's not .
And less his manners .
I provide for those , too .
Come hither Frank , speak to the Gentleman
In Latin : He is melancholy ; say ,
I long to see him merry , and so would treat him .
Subtristis visu' es esse aliquantul?m patri ,
Qui te laut ? excipere , etiam ac tractare gestit .
Tell him , I fear it bodes us some ill luck ,
His too reservedness .
Veretur pater ,
Ne quid nobis mali ominis apportet iste
Nimis pr?clusus vultus .
A fine Child !
You wo ' not part with him , mine Host ?
Who told you
I would not ?
I but ask you .
And I answer ,
To whom ?
for what ?
To me , to be my Page .
I know no mischief yet the Child hath done ,
To deserve such a destiny .
Why ?
Go down Boy ,
And get your Breakfast .
Trust me , I had rather
Take a fair Halter , wash my Hands , and hang him
My self , make a clean riddance of him , than ?
What ?
Than damn him to that desperate course of Life .
Call you that desperate , which by a Line
Of Institution , from our Ancestors ,
Hath been deriv 'd down to us , and receiv 'd
In a Succession , for the Noblest way
Of breeding up our Youth , in Letters , Arms ,
Fair Mein , Discourses , civil Exercise ,
And all the Blazon of a Gentleman ?
Where can he learn to vault , to ride , to fence ,
To move his Body gracefuller ?
to speak
His Language purer ?
or to tune his Mind ,
Or Manners , more to the harmony of Nature ,
Than in these Nurseries of Nobility ?
?
I that was , when the Nurseries self was Noble ,
And only Vertue made it , not the Market ,
That Titles were not vented at the Drum ,
Or common out-cry ; Goodness gave the Greatness ,
And Greatness Worship : Every House became
An Academy of Honour , and those Parts ?
We see departed , in the Practice , now ,
Quite from the Institution .
Why do you say so ?
Or think so enviously ?
do they not still
Learn there the Centaures Skill , the Art of Thrace ,
To ride ?
or Pollux Mystery , to Fence ?
The Pyrrhick Gestures , both to Dance and Spring
In Armour , to be active for the Wars ?
To study Figures , Numbers , and Proportions ,
May yield 'em great in Counsels , and the Arts
Grave Nestor , and the wise Ulysses practis 'd ?
To make their English sweet upon their Tongue !
As Rev'rend Chaucer says ?
Sir you mistake ,
To play Sir Pandarus my Copy hath it ,
And carry Messages to Madam Cresside .
Instead of backing the brave Steed , o ' Mornings ,
To mount the Chambermaid ; and for a leap
O' the vaulting Horse , to ply the vaulting House :
For exercise of Arms , a Bale of Dice ,
Or two or three Packs of Cards to shew the Cheat ,
And nimbleness of Hand : mistake a Cloak
From my Lords back , and pawn it .
Ease his Pockets
Of a superfluous Watch .
Or geld a Jewel
Of an odd Stone or so .
Twinge three or four Buttons
From off my Ladies Gown .
These are the Arts ,
Or Seven liberal deadly Sciences
Of Pagery , or rather Paganism ,
As the Tides run .
To which , if he apply him ,
He may , perhaps , take a degree at Tyburn ,
A year the earlier : come to read a Lecture
Upon Aquinas at S.
Thomas a Waterings ,
And so go forth a Laureat in Hemp circle !
You 're tart , mine Host , and talk above your seasoning ,
O're what you seem : it should not come , methinks ,
Under your Cap , this Vein of salt and sharpness !
These strikings upon Learning , now and then ?
How long have you , ( if your dull Guest may ask it , )
Drove this quick Trade , of keeping the Light-heart ,
Your Mansion , Palace here , or Hostelry ?
Troth , I was born to somewhat , Sir , above it .
I easily suspect that : Mine Host , your Name .
They call me Good-stock .
Sir , and you confess it ,
Both i' your Language , Treaty , and your Bearing .
Yet all , Sir , are not Sons o ' the white Hen ;
Nor can we , as the Songster says , come all
To be wrapt soft and warm in Fortunes Smock :
When she is pleas 'd to trick or tromp Mankind ,
Some may be Coats , as in the Cards ; but , then
Some must be Knaves , some Varlets , Bauds , and Ostlers ,
As Aces , Duizes , Cards o'ten , to face it
Out i' the Game , which all the World is .
But ,
It being i' your free will ( as 'twas ) to choose
What Parts you would sustain , methinks , a Man
Of your sagacity , and clear Nostril , should
Have made , another choise , than of a Place
So sordid , as the keeping of an Inn :
Where every jovial Tinker , for his Chink ,
May cry , mine Host , to Crambe , give us Drink ;
And do not slink , but skink , or else you stink
Rogue , Baud , and Cheater , call you by the Surnames ,
And known Synonyma of your Profession .
But if I be no such ; who then 's the Rogue ,
In understanding , Sir , I mean ?
who errs ?
Who tinkleth then ?
or Personates Thom Tinker ?
Your Weazil here may tell you I talk baudy ,
And teach my Boy it ; and you may believe him :
But Sir , at your own Peril , if I do not :
And at his too , if he do lye , and affirm it .
No Slander strikes , less hurts , the Innocent .
If I be honest , and that all the Cheat
Be of my self , in keeping this Light Heart ,
Where , I imagine all the World 's a Play ;
The State , and Mens Affairs , all Passages
To see the Comedy ; and laugh , and chuck
At the variety and throng of Humors
And Dispositions , that come justling in ,
And out still , as they one drove hence another :
Why , will you envy me my happiness ?
Because you are sad and lumpish ; carry a Load-stone
I ' your Pocket , to hang Knives on ; or jet Rings ,
T' entice light Straws to leap at 'em ; are not taken
With the alacrities of an Host ! ' Tis more ,
And justlier , Sir , my wonder , why you took
My House up , Fidlers Hall , the Seat of noise ,
And mirth , an Inn here , to be drousie in ,
And lodge your Lethargy in the Light Heart ,
As if some Cloud from Court had been your Harbinger ,
Or Cheap-side Debt-Books , or some Mistress charge ,
Seeing your Love grow corpulent , gi' it a Dyet ,
By absence , some such mouldy Passion !
' Tis guess 'd unhappily .
Mine Host , yo 're call 'd .
I come , Boys .
Ferret , have not you been ploughing
With this mad Ox , mine Host ?
Nor he with you ?
For what Sir ?
Why , to find my Riddle out .
I hope , you do believe , Sir , I can find
Other Discourse to be at , than my Master
With Hosts and Hostlers .
If you can , 'tis well .
Go down , and see , who they are come in , what Guests ;
And bring me word .
So tyrannous ! and treacherous ! first t 'enslave ,
And then betray , all that in truth do serve thee !
That not the wisest , nor the wariest creature ,
Can more dissemble thee , than he can bear
Hot burning Coals , in his bare Palm , or Bosom !
And less , conceal , or hide thee , than a flash
Of enflam 'd Powder , whose whole light doth lay it
Open to all discovery , even of those
Who have but half an eye , and less of nose !
An Host , to find me ! who is , commonly ,
The Log , a little o ' this side the Sign-post !
Or at the best some round grown thing , a Jug ,
Fac 'd with a Beard , that fills out to the Guests ,
And takes in fro ' the fragments o ' their Jests ?
But I may wrong this out of sullenness ,
Or my mistaking Humour ?
Pray thee , Phant 'sie ,
Be lay 'd again .
And gentle Melancholy ,
Do not oppress me , I will be as silent ,
As the tame Lover should be , and as foolish .
I have fresh golden Guests , Guests o ' the Game :
Three Coach full ! Lords ! and Ladies ! new come in .
And I will cry them to thee , and thee to them ,
So can I spring a Smile , but i'this Brow ,
That like the rugged Roman Alderman ? ? ?
Old Master Gross , surnam 'd 'AgelastoV
Was never seen to laugh , but as an Ass .
Sir , here 's the Lady Frampul .
How ! Fer .
And her train ,
Lord Beaufort , and Lord Latimer , the Colonel
Tipto' , with Mrs. Cis , the Chamber-maid :
Trundle , the Coachman ?
Stop , discharge the House :
And get my Horses ready , bid the Groom
Bring them to the back Gate .
What mean you , Sir ?
To take fair leave , mine Host .
I hope , my Guest ,
Though I have talked somewhat above my share ,
At large , and been i'the Altitudes , th'Extravagants ,
Neither my self , nor any of mine have gi'n you
The cause to quit my House thus on the sudden .
No, I affirm it on my Faith .
Excuse me
From such a rudeness ; I was now beginning
To taste and love you : and am heartily sorry ,
Any occasion should be so compelling ,
To urge my abrupt departure thus .
But ? ?
Necessity is a Tyrant , and commands it .
She shall command me first to fire my Bush ;
Then break up House : Or , if that will not serve ,
To break with all the World .
Turn Country Bankrupt ,
I ' mine own Town , upo ' the Market-day ,
And be protested for my Butter and Eggs ,
To the last Bodge of Oats , and Bottle of Hay ;
Ere you shall leave me I will break my Heart :
Coach , and Coach-horses , Lords , and Ladies Pack ?
All my fresh Guests shall stink ! I 'll pull my Sign down ,
Convert mine Inn to an Alms-house ! or a Spittle
For Lazers , or Switch-sellers ! Turn it to
An Academy o ' Rogues ! or g 'it away
For a Free-School to breed up Beggars in ,
And send 'em to the canting Universities
Before you leave me .
Troth , and I confess
I am loth , mine Host , to leave you : your Expressions
Both take and hold me .
But , in case I stay ,
I must enjoin you and your whole Family
To privacy , and to conceal me .
For ,
The Secret is , I would not willingly
See , or be seen , to any of this Ging ,
Especially the Lady .
Brain o ' man ,
What Monster is she ?
or Cocatrice in Velvet ,
That kills thus ?
O good words , mine Host .
She is
A noble Lady ! great in Blood and Fortune !
Fair ! and a Wit ! but of so bent a Phant 'sie ,
As she thinks naught a Happiness , but to have
A multitude of Servants ! and to get them ,
( Though she be very honest ) yet she ventures
Upon these Precipices , that would make her
Not seem so , to some prying , narrow natures .
We call her , Sir , the Lady Frances Frampul ,
Daughter and Heir to the Lord Frampul .
Who ?
He that did love in Oxford , first a Student ,
And after , married with the Daughter of-- Lov.
Right , of whom the Tale went , to turn Puppet-master .
And travel with young Goose , the Motion-man .
And lie , and live with the Gipsies half a year
Together , from his Wife .
The very same :
The mad Lord Frampul ! And this same is his Daughter !
But as Cock-brain 'd as ere the Father was !
There were Two of 'em , Frances and L?titia ;
But L?tice was lost young ; and , as the Rumour
Flew then , the Mother upon it lost her self .
A fond weak Woman , went away in a Melancholy ,
Because she brought him none but Girls , she thought
Her Husband lov 'd her not .
And he , as foolish ,
Too late resenting the cause giv'n , went after ,
In quest of her , and was not heard of since .
A strange division of a Family !
And scattered as i' the great confusion !
But yet the Lady , th ' Heir , enjoys the Land .
And takes all lordly ways how to consume it
As nobly as she can ; if Clothes , and Feasting ,
And the authoriz 'd means of Riot will do it .
She shews her Extract , and I honour her for it .
Dis ?
Pleas 'd thou think 'st ?
I cannot tell , discharg 'd
I 'm sure it is .
Charge it again good Ferret .
And make unready the Horses : Thou knowest how .
Chalk , and renew the Rondels , I am now
Resolv 'd to stay .
I easily thought so ,
When you should hear what 's purpos 'd .
What ?
To throw
The House out o'the Windo ' ?
Brain o ' man ,
I shall ha' the worst o ' that ! will they not throw
My Houshold-stuff out first , Cushions , and Carpets ,
Chairs , Stools , and Bedding ?
is not their sport my ruin ?
Fear not , mine Host , I am not o ' the Fellowship .
I cannot see , Sir , how you will avoid it ;
They know already , all , you are i'the House .
Who know ?
The Lords : they have seen me , and enquir 'd it .
Why where you seen ?
Because indeed I had
No Med'cine , Sir , to go invisible :
No Fern-seed in my Pocket ; nor an Opal
Wrapt in a Bay-leaf i 'my left Fist ,
To charm their Eyes with .
He does give you reasons
As round as Giges Ring : Which , say the Ancients ,
Was a hoop Ring ; and that is , round as a Hoop .
You will ha' your Rebus still , mine Host .
I must .
My Lady too , look't out o'the windo' , and call 'd me .
And see where Secretary Pru .
comes from her .
Employ 'd upon some Embassy unto you ? ?
I 'll meet her if she come upon Employment ;
Fair Lady , welcome , as your Host can make you .
Forbear , Sir , I am first to have mine Audience ,
Before
Before the Complement .
This Gentleman
Is my Address to .
And it is in state .
My Lady , Sir , as glad o ' the encounter
To find a Servant here , and such a Servant ,
Whom she so values ; with her best respects ,
Desires to be remembred : and invites
Your Nobleness , to be a part , to day ,
Of the Society , and Mirth intended
By her , and the young Lords , your Fellow-servants .
Who are alike ambitious of enjoying
The fair request ; and to that end have sent
Me , their imperfect Orator , to obtain it :
Which if I may , they have Elected me ,
And Crown 'd me , with the Title of a Soveraign
Of the days Sports devised i' the Inn ,
So you be pleas 'd to add your suffrage to it .
So I be pleas 'd , my gentle Mistress Prudence ;
You cannot think me of that course Condition ,
T' envy you any thing .
That 's nobly said !
And like my Guest ! Lov.
I gratulate your Honour ;
And should , with chear , lay hold on any Handle
That could advance it .
But for me to think ,
I can be any Rag or Particle
O' your Ladies care , more than to fill her List ,
She being the Lady , that professeth still
To love no Soul or Body , but for ends ;
Which are her Sports : And is not nice to speak this ,
But doth proclaim it , in all Companies :
Her Ladiship must pardon my weak Counsels ,
And weaker will , if it decline t ' obey her .
O Master Lovel , you must not give credit
To all that Ladies publickly profess ,
Or talk , o ' th ' Volle , unto their Servanrs .
Their Tongues and Thoughts oft times lye far asunder .
Yet , when the please , they have their Cabinet-counsels ,
And reserv 'd Thoughts , and can retire themselves
As well as others .
I , the subtlest of us !
All that is born within a Ladies Lips ? ?
Is not the Issue of their Hearts , mine Host .
Or kiss , or drink afore me .
Stay , excuse me ;
Mine Errand is not done .
Yet , if her Ladiships
Slighting , or disesteem , Sir , of your Service ,
Hath formerly begot any distaste ,
Which I not know of : here , I vow unto you ,
Upon a Chamber-maids simplicity ,
Reserving , still , the Honour of my Lady ,
I will be bold to hold the Glass up to her ,
To shew her Ladiship where she hath err 'd ,
And how to tender satisfaction :
So you vouchsafe to prove , but the days venture .
What say you Sir ?
where are you ?
are you within ?
Yes , I will wait upon her , and the Company .
It is enough , Queen Prudence ; I will bring him :
And , o ' this kiss .
I long 'd to kiss a Queen !
There is no Life on Earth , but being in Love !
There are no Studies , no Delights , no Business ,
No entercourse , or trade of Sense , or Soul ,
But what is Love ! I was the laziest Creature ,
The most unprofitable sign of nothing ,
The veriest Drone , and slept away my Life
Beyond the Dormouse , till I was in Love !
And , now , I can out wake the Nightingale ,
Out-watch an Usurer , and Out-walk him too ,
Stalk like a Ghost , that haunted 'bout a Treasure ,
And all that phant 'si 'd Treasure , it is Love !
But is your name Love-ill , Sir , or Love-well ?
I would know that .
I do not know't my self ,
Whether it is .
But it is Love hath been
The Hereditary Passion of our House ,
My gentle Host , and , as I guess , my Friend ;
The truth is , I have lov 'd this Lady long ,
And impotently , with desire enough ,
But no success : for I have still forborn
To express it , in my Person , to her .
How then ?
I ha' sent her Toys , Verses , and Anagram 's ,
Trials o ' Wit , mere Trifles she has commended ,
But knew not whence they came , nor could she guess .
This was a pretty ridling way of wooing !
I oft have been , too , in her Company ;
And look 'd upon her , a whole day ; admir 'd her ;
Lov 'd her , and did not tell her so ; lov 'd still ,
Look 'd still , and lov 'd ; and lov 'd , and look 'd , and sigh 'd ;
But , as a Man neglected , I came off ,
And unregarded ?
Could you blame her , Sir ,
When you were silent , and not said a word ?
O but I lov 'd the more ; and she might read it
Best , in my silence , had she been ?
As melancholick
As you are .
'Pray you , why would you stand mute , Sir ?
O thereon hangs a History , mine Host .
Did you ever know , or hear , of the Lord Beaufort ,
Who serv 'd so bravely in France ?
I was his Page ,
And ere he dy 'd , his Friend ! I follow 'd him ,
First , i' the Wars , and i' the times of Peace ,
I waited on his Studies ; which were right .
He had no Arthurs , nor no Rosicleer 's ,
No Knights o ' the Sun , nor Amadis de Gauls ,
Primalions , and Pantagruel 's , publick Nothings ;
Abortives of the Fabulous , dark Cloyster ,
Sent out to poison Courts and infest Manners :
In his immortal Phant 'sie , for Examples
Of the Heroick Vertue .
Or , as Virgil ,
That Master of the Epick Poem , limn 'd
Pious ?neas , his religious Prince ,
Bearing his aged Parent on his Shoulders ,
Rapt from the Flames of Troy , with his young Son .
And these he brought to practise , and to use .
He gave me first my Breeding , I acknowledge ,
Then showr 'd his Bounties on me , like the Howres ,
That open-handed sit upon the Clouds ,
And press the Liberality of Heaven
Down to the Laps of thankful Men ! But then !
The trust committed to me , at his death ,
Was above all ! and left so strong a tye
On all my Powers ! as time shall not dissolve !
Till it dissolve it self , and bury all !
The care of his brave Heir , and only Son !
Who being a Vertuous , sweet , young , hopeful Lord ,
Hath cast his first Affections on this Lady .
And though I know , and may presume her such ,
As , out of Humor , will return no Love ;
And therefore might indifferently be made
The Courting-stock , for all to practise on ,
As she doth practise on all us , to scorn :
Yet , out of a Religion to my Charge ,
And Debt profess 'd , I ha' made a Self-decree ,
Nere to express my Person , though my Passion
Burn me to Cinders .
Then yo 'are not so subtil ,
Or half so read in Love-craft , as I took you .
Come , come , you are no Ph ?nix ,
an' you were ,
I should expect no Miracle from your Ashes .
Take some advice .
Be still that Rag of Love ,
You are .
Burn on till you turn Tinder .
This Chamber-maid may hap to prove the Steel ,
To strike a sparkle out o ' the Flint , your Mistress
May beget Bonfires yet , you do not know ,
What light may be forc 'd out , and from what darkness .
Nay , I am so resolv 'd , as still I 'll love
Tho ' not confess it .
That 's , Sir , as it chances :
We 'll throw the Dice for it : Chear up .
I do .
It was a great deal with the biggest for me ;
Which made me leave it off after once wearing .
How do 's it fit ?
wilt come together ?
Thou must make shift with it .
Pride feels no Pain .
Girt thee hard , Pru .
Pox o ' this errand Taylour ,
He angers me beyond all mark of Patience .
These base Mechanicks never keep their word ,
In any thing they promise .
' Tis their Trade , Madam ,
To swear and break , they all grow rich by breaking ,
More then their Words ; their Honesties , and Credits ,
Are still the first Commodity they put off .
And worst , it seems , which makes 'em do 't so often .
If he had but broke with me , I had not car 'd ,
But , with the Company , the Body Politick ?
Frustrate our whole design , having that time ,
And the Materials in so long before ?
And he to fail in all , and disappoint us ?
The Rogue deserves a torture ?
To be crop 'd
With his own Scizzars .
Let 's devise him one .
And ha' the Stumps sear 'd up with his own searing Candle ?
Close to his Head , to trundle on his Pillow ?
I 'll ha' the Lease of his House cut out into Measures .
And he be strangl 'd with 'em ?
No, no Life
I would ha' toucht , but stretch 'd on his own Yard
He should be a little , ha' the strappado ! Pru .
Or an Ell of Taffata
Drawn thorough his Guts , by way of Glister , & fir 'd
With Aqua vit? ?
Burning i' the Hand
With the pressing Iron cannot save him .
Yes ,
Now I have got this on : I do forgive him ,
What Robes he should ha' brought .
Thou art not cruel ,
Although streight-lac 'd , I see , Pru ! Pru ! This is well .
' Tis rich enough ! But 'tis not what I meant thee !
I would ha' had thee braver then my self ,
And brighter far .
' Twill fit the Players yet ,
When thou hast done with it , and yield thee somewhat .
That were illiberal , Madam , and mere sordid
In me , to let a Suit of yours come there .
Here is a Scarf , to make thee a Knot finer .
You send me a feasting , Madam .
Wear it Wench .
Yes , but , with leave o ' your Ladiship , I would tell you
This can but bear the Face of an odd Journey .
Why Pru ?
A Lady of your Rank and Quality ,
To come to a publick Inn , so many Men ,
Young Lords , and others , i' your Company !
And not a Woman but my self , a Chamber-maid !
Thou doubt 'st to be over-laid Pru ?
Fear it not ,
I 'll bear my Part , and share with thee , i' the Venture .
O but the Censure , Madam , is the main ,
What will they say of you ?
or judge of me ?
To be translated thus , 'bove all the bound
Of fitness , or decorum ?
How , now ! Pru !
Turn 'd Fool upo ' the sudden , and talk idly
I ' thy best Clothes ! shoot Bolts and Sentences
T' affright Babies with ?
as if I liv 'd
To any other Scale than what 's my own ?
Or fought my self , without my self , from home ?
Your Ladiship will pardon me , my fault ,
If I have over shot , I 'll shoot no more .
Yes shoot again , good Pru , I 'll ha thee shoot ,
And aim , and hit : I know 'tis love in thee ,
And so I do interpret it .
Then Madam ,
I'ld crave a farther leave .
Be it to Licence ,
It sha' not want an Ear , Pru , Say , what is it ?
A Toy I have , to raise a little Mirth
To the design in hand .
Out with it Pru .
If it but chime of Mirth .
Mine Host has , Madam ,
A pretty Boy i' the House , a dainty Child ,
His Son , and is of your Ladiships Name too , Frances ,
Whom if you Ladiship would borrow of him ,
And give me leave to dress him , as I would ,
Should make the finest Lady and Kinswoman ,
To keep you Company , and deceive my Lords ,
Upo ' the Matter , with a Fountain o ' sport .
I apprehend thee , and the source of Mirth
That it may breed , but is he bold enough ,
The Child ?
and well assur 'd ?
As I am , Madam ,
Have him in no suspicion , more than me .
Here comes mine Host ; will you but please to ask him ,
Or let me make the Motion ?
Which thou wilt , Pru .
I thank my hearty Host .
So is your Soveraignty ,
Madam , I wish you joy o ' your new Gown .
It should ha' been , my Host , but Stuff ; our Taylor
Has broke with us , you shall be o ' the Counsel .
He will deserve it , Madam , my Lady has heard
You have a pretty Son , mine Host , she 'ld see him .
I very fain , I pr'y thee let me see him , Host .
Your Ladiship shall presently :
Bid Frank come hither , anon , unto my Lady ,
It is a bashful Child , homely brought up ,
In a rude Hostelry .
But the Light Heart
Is his Fathers , and it may be his .
Here he comes .
Frank , salute my Lady .
I do .
What , Madam , I am design 'd to do , by my Birth-right ,
As Heir of the Light Heart , bid you most welcome .
And I believe you most , my pretty Boy ,
Being so emphased by you .
Your Ladiship ,
If you believe it such , are sure to make it .
Prettily answer 'd ! Is your Name Francis ?
Yes , Madam .
I love mine own the better .
If I knew yours ,
I should make haste to do so too , good Madam .
It is the same with yours .
Mine then acknowledgeth
The Lustre it receives , by being nam 'd after .
You will win upon me in Complement .
By silence .
A modest and fair well-spoken Child .
Her Ladiship shall have him , Soveraign Pru ,
Or what I have beside ; divide my Heart
Between you and your Lady .
Make your use of it :
My House is yours , my Son is yours .
Behold ,
I tender him to your Service ; Frank , become
What these brave Ladies would ha' you .
Only this ,
There is a Chair-woman i' the House , his Nurse ,
An Irish Woman , I took in a Beggar ,
That waits upon him ; a poor silly Fool ,
But an impertinent and sedulous one
As ever was ; will vex you on all occasions ,
Never be off , or from you , but in her sleep;
Or drink which makes it ; She doth love him so ,
Or rather doat on him .
Now , for her , a shape ,
As we may dress her ( and I 'll help ) to fit her ,
With a Tuft Taffata-Cloak , an old French Hood ,
And other Pieces , heterogene enough .
We ha' brought a Standard of Apparel down ,
Because this Taylor fail 'd us i' the main .
She shall advance the Game .
About it then .
And send but Trundle hither , the Coachman , to me .
I shall : But Pru , let Lovel ha' fair quarter .
The best .
Our Host ( me thinks ) is very gamesom !
How like you the Boy ?
A Miracle ! Pru .
Good Madam ,
But take him in , and sort a Suit for him ,
I 'll give our Trundle his Instructions ;
And wait upon your Ladiship i' the Instant .
But
But Pru , what shall we call him when we ha' drest him ?
My Lady-No-body , any thing , what you will .
Call him L?titia , by my Sisters name ,
And so 'twill mind our Mirth too we have in hand .
And lead the Horses out but half a Mile ,
Into the Fields , whether you will , and then
Drive in again , with the Coach-leaves put down ,
At the back Gate , and so to the back Stairs ,
As if you brought in some body to my Lady ,
A Kinswoman that she sent for .
Make that answer ,
If you be ask 'd ; and give it out i'the House so .
What Trick is this , good Mistress Secretary ,
You 'ld put upon us ?
Us ?
Do you speak plural ?
Me and my Mares are us .
If you so join 'em .
Elegant Trundle , you may use your Figures :
I can but urge , it is my Ladies Service .
Good Mistress Prudence , you can urge enough .
I know you are Secretary to my Lady ,
And Mistress Steward .
You 'll still be trundling ,
And ha' your Wages stopt , now at the Audite .
Tis true , you 're Gentlewoman o'the Horse too ;
Or what you will beside , Pru .
I do think it :
My best t 'obey you .
And I think so too , Trundle .
If we do make no more discovery .
What ?
Then o'this Parasite ?
O he 's a dainty one .
The Parasite o'the House .
Here comes mine Host .
My Lords you both are welcome to the Heart .
To the light heart we hope .
And merry I swear .
We never yet felt such a fit of Laughter ,
As your glad heart hath offered us sin' we entred .
How came you by this property ?
who! my Fly ?
Your Fly , if you call him so .
Nay , he is that ;
And will be still .
In every Dish and Pot ?
In every Cup and Company , my Lords ,
A Creature of all Liquors , all Complexions ,
Be the Drink what it will he 'll have his sip .
He 's fitted with a Name .
And he joys in't .
I had him when I came to take the Inn here ,
Assign 'd me over in the Inventory ,
As an old Implement , a piece of Houshold-stuff ,
And so he doth remain .
Just such a thing
We thought him .
Is he a Scholar ?
Nothing less .
But colours for it , as you see : wear 's black ,
And speaks a little tainted , fly-blown Latin ,
After the School .
Of Stratford o ' the Bow :
For Lillies Latin is to him unknown .
What calling has he ?
Only to call in still ,
Enflame the reckoning , bold to charge a Bill ,
Bring up the Shot i'the rear , as his own word is .
And do 's it in the discipline of the House ?
As Corporal o ' the Field , Maestro del Campo ,
And Visiter general of all the Room :
He has form 'd a fine Militia for the Inn too .
And means to publish it ?
With all his Titles ;
Some call him Deacon Fly , some Doctor Fly ;
Some Captain , some Lieutenant : But my Folks
Do call him Quarter-master Fly , which he is .
Here 's one already
Hath got his Titles .
Doctor ! Fly .
Noble Colonel !
No Doctor , yet , a poor professor of Ceremony ,
Here i' the Inn , retainer to the Host ,
I discipline the House .
Thou read 'st a Lecture
Unto the Family here : when is the Day ?
This is the day .
I 'll hear thee , and I 'll ha' thee a Doctor ,
Thou shalt be one , thou hast a Doctors look !
A face , disputative of Salamanca .
Who 's this ?
The glorious Colonel Tipto , Host .
One talks upon his Tiptoes , if you 'll hear him .
Thou hast good Learning in thee , macte Fly .
And I say macte to my Colonel .
Well macted of 'em both .
They are match 'd i'faith .
But Fly , why macte ?
Quasi magis aucte ,
My honourable Colonel .
What a Critique ?
There 's another accession , Critique Fly .
I fear a taint here i'the Mathematicks .
They say , Lines parallel do never meet ;
He has met his parallel in Wit and School-craft .
They side , not meet man , mend your Metaphor ,
And save the credit of your Mathematicks .
But Fly , how cam 'st thou to be here , committed
Unto this Inn ?
Upon suspicion o ' drink Sir .
I was taken late one night here with the Tapster ,
And the Under-Officers , and so deposited .
I will redeem thee , Fly , and place thee better ,
With a fair Lady .
A Lady , sweet Sir Glorious !
A Sov'reign Lady .
Thou shalt be the Bird
To Sovereign Pru , Queen of our Sports , her Fly ,
The Fly in houshold and in ordinary ;
Bird of her Ear , and she shall wear thee there !
A Fly of Gold , enamell 'd , and a School-Fly .
The School then , are my Stables , or the Cellar ,
Where he doth study deeply , at his Hours ,
Cases of Cups , I do not know how spic 'd
With Conscience , for the Tapster and the Hostler ; as
Whose Horses may be cousen 'd ?
or what Jugs
Fill 'd up with Froth ?
that is his way of Learning .
What antiquated Feather 's that that talks ?
The worshipful Host , my Patron , Mr. Good-stock ,
A merry Greek , and cants in Latin comly ,
Spins like the Parish Top .
I 'll set him up then .
Art thou the Dominus ?
Fac-totum here , Sir .
Host real o'the House ?
and Cap of Maintenance ?
The Lord o'the light Heart , Sir , Cap a pie ;
Whereof the Feather is the Emblem , Colonel ,
Put up with the Ace of Hearts ! Tip .
But why in Cuerpo ?
I hate to see an Host , and old , in Cuerpo .
Cuerpo ?
what 's that .
Light skipping Hose and Doublet .
The Horse-boys Garb ! poor blank , and half blank
They relish not the gravity of an Host ,
Who should be the King at Arms , and Ceremonies Cuerpo ,
In his own House ! know all , to the Gold weights .
Why that his Fly doth for him here , your Bird .
But I would do it my self were I my Host ,
I would not speak unto a Cook of quality ,
Your Lordships Footman , or my Ladies Trundle ,
In Cuerpo! If a Dog but stay 'd below ,
That were a Dog of Fashion , and well nos 'd ,
And could present himself ; I would put on
The Savoy Chain about my Neck , the Ruff
And Cuffs of Flanders , then the Naples Hat ,
With the Rome Hatband , and the Florentin Agate ,
The Millan Sword , the Cloak of Genoa set
With Brabant Buttons ; all my given Pieces
Except my Gloves , the Natives of Madrid ,
To entertain him in ; and complement
With a tame Coney , as with a Prince that sent it .
A a a a a Host .
The same deeds , though , become not every man ;
That fits a Colonel , will not fit an Host .
Your Spanish Host is never seen in Cuerpo ,
Without his Paramento 's Cloak and Sword .
Sir he has the father
Of Swords , within a long Sword ; Blade cornish stil 'd
Of Sir Rud Hughdebras .
And with a long Sword , bully Bird ?
thy sence ?
To note him a tall Man , and a Master of Fence .
But doth he teach the Spanish way of Don Lewis ?
No, the Greek Master he .
What call you him ?
Fart upon Euclide , he is stale and antick .
Gi 'me the Moderns .
Sir , he minds no Moderns ,
Go by , Hieronimo! Tip .
What was he ?
The Italian ,
That plaid with Abbot Antony i' the Fryars ,
And Blinkin-sops the bold .
I marry , those ,
Had fencing Names , what 's become o ' them ?
They had their times , and we can say , they were .
So had Caranza his : so had Don Lewis .
Don Lewis of Madrid , is the sole Master
Now of the World .
But this o'the other World
Euclide demonstrates ! he ! Hee 's for all !
The only Fencer of Name , now in Elysium .
He do 's it all by Lines and Angles , Colonel ;
By Parallels and Sections , has his Diagrams !
Wilt thou be flying , Fly ?
At all , why not ?
The Air 's as free for a Fly as for an Eagle .
A Buzzard ! he is in his contemplation !
Euclide a Fencer , and in the Elysium !
He play 'd a Prize last week with Archimedes ,
And beat him I assure you .
Do you assure me ?
For what ?
For four i' the hundred .
Gi' me five ,
And I assure you again .
Host , Peremptory ,
You may be tane , but where ?
whence had you this ?
Upo ' the Road , A Post that came from thence ,
Three days ago , here , left it with the Tapster .
Who is indeed a Thorough-fare of news ,
Jack Jug with the broken Belly , a witty fellow !
Your Bird here heard him .
Did you hear him , Bird ?
Speak i' the faith of a Fly .
Yes , and he told us ,
Of one that was the Prince of Oranges Fencer ,
Stevinus ?
Sir , the same had challeng 'd Euclide
At thirty weapons more than Archimedes
E'er saw , and Engines ; most of his own Invention .
This may have credit , and chimes reason , this !
If any man endanger Euclide , Bird ,
Observe , that had the Honour to quit Europe
This forty years , 'tis he .
He put down Scaliger .
And he was a great Master .
Not of Fence , Fly .
Excuse him , Lord , he went o ' the same grounds .
On the same earth I think , with other Mortals ?
I mean , sweet Lord , the Mathematicks .
Basta !
When thou know 'st more , thou wilt take less green honour .
He had his Circles , Semicircles , Quadrants ?
He writ a Book o ' the quadrature o'the Circle ,
Cyclometria , I read ?
The Title only .
And Indice .
If it had one of that qu?re ,
What insolent , half-witted things these are ?
So are all Smatterers , insolent , and impudent .
They lightly go together .
' Tis my wonder
Two Animals should hawk at all discourse thus !
Flie every Subject to the Mark , or retrieve ? ?
And never ha' the luck to be i'the right ?
' Tis some folks fortune ! Bea .
Fortune 's a Bawd ,
And a blind Beggar : 'tis their vanity !
And shews most vilely ! Tip .
I could take the heart now
To write unto Don Lewis into Spain ,
To make a progress to the Elysium Fields
Next Summer ?
And perswade him die for fame ,
Of fencing with a shadow ! Where 's mine Host ?
I would he had heard this Bubble break , i'faith .
MAke place , stand by , for the Queen Regent , Gentlemen .
This is thy Queen that shall be , Bird , our Soveraign .
Translated Prudence ! Pru .
Sweet my Lord , hand off ;
It is not now , as when plain Prudence liv 'd
And reach 'd her Ladiship ?
The Chamber-pot .
The Lookinglass , mine Host , loose your House Metaphor ?
You 've a negligent Memory indeed ;
Speak the Host 's Language .
Here 's a young Lord
Will make 't a precedent else .
Well acted Pru .
First minute of her Reign ! what will she do
Forty year hence ?
God bless her ! Pru .
If you 'll kiss ,
Or complement , my Lord , behold a Lady ,
A stranger , and my Ladies Kinswoman .
I do confess my rudeness , that had need
To have mine Eye directed to this Beauty .
It was so little , as it ask 'd a Perspicill .
Lady , your name ?
My Lord , it is L?titia .
L?titia ! a fair Omen ! and I take it .
Let me have still such Lettice for my Lips :
But that o ' your Family , Lady Fra .
Silly , Sir .
My Ladies Kinswoman ?
I am so honour 'd .
Already , it takes ! Lad .
An excellent fine Boy .
He is descended of a right good Stock , Sir .
What 's this ?
an Antiquary ?
An Antiquity ,
By th 'dress , you 'ld swear ! An old Welsh Heralds widdow :
She 's a wild-Irish born ! Sir , and a Hybride ,
That lives with this young Lady , a mile off here ,
And studies Vincent against York .
She 'll conquer
If she read Vincent .
Let me study her .
She 's perfect in most Pedigrees , most Descents .
A Baud , I hope , and knows to blaze a Coat .
And judgeth all things with a single Eye .
Fly , come you hither ; no discovery
Of what you see , to your Colonel Toe , or Tip here ,
But keep all close , tho ' you stand i' the way o ' preferment ,
Seek it off from the Road ; no Flattery for't :
No Lick-foot , pain of loosing your proboscis :
My Liquorish Fly .
What says old Velvet-head ?
He will present me himself , Sir , if you will not .
Who ?
he present ?
what ?
whom ?
An Host ?
A Groom ?
Divide the thanks with me ?
share in my Glories ?
Lay up .
I say no more .
Then silence Sir ,
And hear the Sov'raign .
Hostlers ?
to usurp
Upon my Sparta or Province , as they say ?
No Broom but mine ?
Still Colonel you mutter !
I dare speak out , as Cuerpo .
Noble Colonel ?
And carry what I ask ?
Ask what you can Sir ,
So't be i'th House .
I ask my Rights and Priviledges ;
And though for form I please to call it a Suit ,
I have not been accustomed to repulse .
No, sweet Sir Glorious , you may still command ?
And go without .
But yet , Sir , being the first ,
And call 'd a Suit , you 'll look it shall be such
As we may grant .
It else denies it self .
You hear the opinion of the Court .
I mind
No Court Opinions .
' Tis my Ladies though .
My Lady is a Spinster at the Law ,
And my Petition is of right .
What is it ?
It is for this poor learned Bird .
The Fly ?
Professor in the Inn , here , of small matters .
How he commends him ! Host .
As to save himself in him .
So do all Politicks in their Commendations .
This is a State-bird , and the verier Fly ;
But
Hear him problematize .
Bless us , what 's that ?
Or syllogize , elenchize .
Sure , petard 's ,
To blow us up .
Some inginous strong words !
He means to erect a Castle i' the Air ,
And make his Fly an Elephant to carry it .
Bird of the Arts he is , and Fly by Name !
Blow him off good Pru , they 'll mar all else .
The Soveraign 's Honour is to cherish Learning .
What in a Fly ?
In any thing industrious .
But Flies are busie ! Lad .
Nothing more troublesom ,
Or importune ! Tip .
There 's nothing more domestick ,
Tame or familiar then your Fly in Cuerpo .
That is when his Wings are cut , he is tame indeed , else
Nothing more impudent and greedy ; licking :
Or sawcy , good Sir Glorious .
Leave your Advocate-ship
Except that we shall call you Orator Fly ,
And send you down to the Dresser and the Dishes .
A good flap , that ! Pru .
Commit you to the Steem !
Or else condemn you to the Bottles .
And Pots .
There is his quarry .
He will chirp far better ,
Your Bird , below .
And make you finer Musick .
His Buz will there become him .
Come away ,
Buz , in their Faces : Give 'em all the Buz ,
Dor in their Ears and Eyes , Hum , Dor , and Buz !
I will statuminate and under-prop thee .
If they scorn us , let us scorn them ?
We 'll find
The Thorough-fare below , and Qu?re him ,
Leave these Relicts , Buz ; they shall see that I ,
Spight of their jears , dare drink , and with a Fly .
A fair remove at once , of two Impertinents !
Excellent Pru ! I love thee for thy Wit ,
No less then State .
One must preserve the other .
Who 's here ?
O Lovel , Madam , your sad Servant .
Sad ?
he is sullen still , and wears a Cloud
About his Brows ; I know not how to approach him .
I will instruct you , Madam , if that be all ,
Go to him and kiss him .
How , Pru ?
Go , and
kiss him ,
I do command it .
Th'art not wild , Wench ! Pru .
No,
Tame , and exceeding tame , but still your Sov'raign .
Hath too much bravery made thee mad ?
Nor proud .
Do what I do enjoyn you .
No disputing
Of my Prerogative , with a front or frown ;
Do not detract ; you know th ' Authority
Is mine , and I will exercise it swiftly ,
If you provoke me .
I have woven a Net
To snare my self in ! Sir , I am enjoyn 'd
To tender you a kiss ; but do not know
Why , or wherefore , only the Pleasure Royal
Will have it so , and urges ?
Do not you
Triumph on my Obedience , seeing it forc 'd thus .
There 'tis .
And welcome .
Was there ever kiss
That relish 'd thus ! or had a Sting like this ,
Of so much Nectar , but , with Aloes mixt .
No murmuring , nor repining , I am fixt .
It had , me thinks , a quintessence of either ,
But that which was the better , drown 'd the bitter .
How soon it pass 'd away ! how unrecovered !
The distillation of another Soul
Was not so sweet ! and till I meet again ,
That kiss , those Lips , like relish , and this taste .
Let me turn all Consumption , and here wast .
The Royal Assent is past , and cannot alter .
You 'll turn a Tyran .
Be not you a Rebel ,
It is a Name is alike odious .
You 'll hear me ?
No, not o ' this Argument .
Would you make Laws , and be the first that break 'em ?
The Example is pernicious in a Subject ,
And of your quality , most .
Excellent Princess !
Just Queen ! Lat .
Brave Sov'raign .
A she Trajan ! this !
What is't ?
Proceed incomparable Pru !
I am glad I am scarce at leisure to applaud thee .
It 's well for you , you have so happy Expressions .
Yes , cry her up ; with Acclamations , do ,
And cry me down , run all with Soveraignty :
Prince , Power will never want her Parasites .
Nor Murmur her Pretences : Master Lovel ,
For so your Libel here , or Bill of Complaint ,
Exhibited , in our High Court of Sov'raignty ,
At this first hour of our Reign , declares
Against this noble Lady , a dis-respect
You have conceiv 'd , if not receiv 'd , from her .
Received , so the Charge lies in our Bill .
We see it , his learned Council , leave your planing .
We that do love our Justice , above all
Our other Attributes ; and have the nearness ,
To know your extraordinary Merit ,
As also to discern this Ladies Goodness ;
And find how loth she 'd be to lose the Honour ,
And Reputation , she hath had , in having
So worthy a Servant , though but for few Minutes .
Do here Enjoyn .
Good ! Pru .
Charge , Will and Command
Her Ladiship , pain of our high Displeasure ,
And committing an extream Contempt ,
Unto the Court , our Crown and Dignity .
Excellent Soveraign ! And egregious Pru !
To entertain you for a pair of Hours ,
( Choose , when you please , this day ) with all respects ,
And valuation of a principal Servant ,
To give you all the Titles , all the Priviledges ,
The Freedoms , Favours , Rights , she can bestow .
Large , ample Words , of a brave Latitude !
Or can be expected , from a Lady of Honour ,
Or Quality , in Discourse , Access , Address .
Not to give Ear , or admit Conference
With any Person but your self .
Nor there ,
Of any other Argument but Love ,
And the Companion of it , gentile Courtship ,
For which your two hours Service , you shall take
Two kisses .
Noble ! Pru .
For each hour a kiss ,
To be tane freely , fully , and legally ,
Before us : in the Court here , and our Presence .
Rare !
But those hours past , and the two kisses paid ,
The binding Caution is , never to hope
Renewing of the Time , or of the Suit ,
On any Circumstance .
A hard Condition !
Had it been easier , I should have suspected
The Sov'raign 's Justice .
O you are Servant ,
My Lord , unto the Lady , and a Rival :
In point of Law , my Lord , you may be challeng 'd .
I am not jealous ! Host .
Of so short a time
Your Lordship needs not , and being done , in foro .
What is the answer ?
He craves respite , Madam ,
To advise with his Learned Council .
Be you he ,
And go together quickly .
You are no Tyran ?
If I be Madam , you were best appeal me !
Beaufort ?
I am busie , pr'ythee let me alone :
I have a Cause in hearing too .
At what Bar ?
Love 's Court o ' Requests ! Lat .
Bring 't into the Soveraignty :
It is the Nobler Court , afore Judge Pru ,
The only Learned Mother of the Law !
And Lady o ' Conscience , too ! Bea .
' Tis well enough
Before this Mistress of Requests , where it is .
Let 'em not scorn you .
Bear up Master Lovel ,
And take your Hours and Kisses , They are a Fortune .
Which I cannot approve , and less make use of .
Still i' this Cloud ! why cannot you make use of ?
Who would be rich to be so soon undone ?
The Beggars best is Wealth , he doth not know :
And , but to shew it him , inflames his want :
Two hours at height ?
That Joy is too too narrow .
Would bound a Love , so infinite as mine :
And being past , leaves an eternal loss .
Who so prodigiously affects a Feast ,
To forfeit Health and Appetite , to see it ?
Or but to taste a Spoon-full , would forgo
A a a a a 2 All
All gust of Delicacy ever after ?
These , yet , are hours of hope .
But all hours following
Years of Despair , ages of Misery !
Nor can so short a happiness , but spring
A World of fear , with thought of loosing it ;
Better be never happy , then to feell
A little of it , and then loose it ever .
I do confess , it is a strict injunction ;
But then the hope is , it may not be kept .
A thousand things may intervene , we see
The Wind shift often , thrice a day sometimes ;
Decrees may alter upon better motion ,
And riper hearing .
The best Bow may start ,
And th ' Hand may vary .
Pru may be a Sage
In Law , and yet not sour , sweet Pru , smooth Pru ,
Soft , debonaire , and amiable Pru ,
May do as well as rough and rigid Pru ;
And yet maintain her , Venerable Pru ,
Majestick Pru , and Serenissimous Pru .
Try but one hour first , and as you like
The loose o ' that , draw home and prove the other .
If one hour could , the other happy make ,
I should attempt it .
Put it on : and do .
Or in the blest Attempt that I might dye !
I marry , there were happiness indeed ;
Transcendent to the Melancholy , meant .
It were a Fate above a Monument ,
And all Inscription , to die so .
A Death
For Emperors to enjoy ! And the Kings
Of the Rich East to pawn their Regions for ;
To sow their Treasure , open all their Mines ,
Spend all their Spices to embalm their Corps ,
And wrap the Inches up in Sheets of Gold ,
That fell by such a Noble destiny !
And for the wrong to your Friend , that fear 's away ,
He rather wrongs himself , following fresh Light ,
New Eyes to swear by .
If Lord Beaufort change ,
It is no Crime in you to remain constant .
And upon these Conditions , at a Game
So urg 'd upon you .
Sir you Resolution ? ?
How is the Lady affected ?
Sov'raigns use not
To ask their Subjects suffrage where 'tis due ;
But where Conditional .
A Royal Sov'raign !
And a rare States-woman .
I admire her bearing
In her new Regiment .
Come choose your hours ,
Better be happy for a part of time ,
Then not the whole : and a short Part , then never .
Shall I appoint 'em , pronounce for you ?
Your pleasure .
Then he designs his first hour after Dinner ;
His second after Supper .
Say ye ?
Content ?
I am content .
What 's that ?
I am content too .
You have reason ,
You had it on the by , and we observ 'd it .
Trot I am not content : in fait ' I am not .
Why art not thou content , Good shelee-nien ?
He tauk so desperate , and so debausht ,
So baudy like a Courtier and a Lord ,
God bless him , one that tak'th Tobacco .
Very well mixt .
What did he say ?
Nay , nothing to the purposh ,
Or very little , nothing at all to purposh .
Let him alone Nurse .
I did tell him of Serly
Was a great Family come out of Ireland ,
Descended of O Neal , Mac Con , Mac Dermot ,
Mac Murrogh , but he mark 'd not .
Nor do I ,
Good Queen of Heralds , ply the Bottle , and sleep.
It is a fine Militia , and well order 'd !
And the Division 's neat ! ' Twill be desir 'd
Only , the Expressions were a little more Spanish :
For there 's the best Militia o ' the World !
To call 'em Tertias .
Tertia of the Kitchin ,
The Tertia of the Cellar , Tertia of the Chamber ,
And Tertia of the Stables .
That I can Sir ,
And find out very able , fit Commanders .
In every Tertia .
Now you are i' the right !
As i' the Tertia o ' the Kitchin , your self
Being a Person , elegant in Sawces ,
There to Command , as prime Maestro del Campo ,
Chief Master of the Palate , for that Tertia ;
Or the Cook under you , 'cause you are the Marshal ;
And the next Officer i' the Field , to the Host .
Then for the Cellar , you have young Anon ,
Is a rare Fellow , what 's his other Name ?
Pierce , Sir Tip .
Sir Pierce , I 'll ha' him a Cavalier .
Sir Pierce Anon , will peirce us a new Hogs-head !
And then your Thorow-fare , Jug here , his Alferez :
An able Officer , gi' me thy Beard , round Jug ,
I take thee by this Handle , and do love
One of thy Inches ! I ' the Chambers , Jordan , here !
He is the Don , del Campo o ' the Beds .
And for the Stables , what 's his Name ?
Old Peck .
Maestro del Campo , Peck ! His name is curt ,
A Monosyllable , but Commands the Horse well .
O , in a Inn , Sir , we have other Horse ,
Let those Troops rest a while .
Wine is the Horse ,
That we must charge with here .
Bring up the Troops ,
Or call sweet Fly , 'tis an exact Militia ,
And thou an exact Professor , Lipsius Fly ,
Thou shalt be call 'd , and Jouse : Jack Ferret , welcome ,
Old Trench-master , and Colonel o ' the Pyoneers ,
What canst thou bolt us now ?
a Coney ?
or two
Out of Tom .
Trundle 's Burrow , here , the Coach ?
This is the Mast of the Carriages !
How is thy driving Tom .
good , as 'twas ?
It serves my Lady , and our Officer Pru .
Twelve Mile an hour ! Tom has the old Trundle still .
I am taken with the Family , here , fine Fellows ?
Viewing the Muster-roll .
They are brave Men !
And of the Fly-blown discipline all , the Quarter-Master !
The Fly 's a rare Bird , in his Profession !
Let 's sip a private Pint with him , I would have him
Quit this Light Sign of the Light Heart , my Bird :
And lighter House .
It is not for his tall
And growing Gravity so Cedar-like ,
To be the second to an Host in Cuerpo ,
That knows no Elegancies , use his own
Dictamen , and his Genius , I would have him
Fly high , and strike at all .
Here 's young Anon , too .
What Wine is't Gentlemen , White or Claret ?
My brisk Anon .
I 'll draw you Juno 's Milk
That died the Lillies , Colonel .
Do so Pierce .
A Plague of all Jades , what a Clap he has gi'n me ?
Why , how now Cousen ?
Who 's that ?
The Hostler .
What ail 'st thou Cousen Peck ?
O me , my hanches !
As sure as you live , Sir , he knew perfectly
I meant to couzen him .
He did leer so on me ,
And then he snear 'd .
As who would say take heed Sirrah ;
And when he saw our Half-peck , which you know
Was but an old Court-dish , Lord how he stampt !
I thought , 't had been for Joy .
When suddenly
He cuts me a back Caper with his Heels ,
And takes me just o ' the Crooper .
Down come I
And
And my whole Ounce of Oats ! Then he neighed out ,
As if he had a Mare by the Tail .
Troth Cousen ,
You are to blame to use the poor dumb Christians
So cruelly , defraud 'em o ' their dimensum .
Yonder 's the Colonels Horse ( there I look 'd in )
Keeping our Ladies Eve ! The Devil a bit
He has got , sin' he came in yet ! There he stands ,
And looks and looks , but 'tis your pleasure , Couss ,
He should look lean enough .
He has Hay before him
Yes , but as gross as Hemp , and as soon will choak him ,
Unless he eat it butter 'd .
H' had four Shooes ,
And good ones , when he came in : It is a wonder ,
With standing still he should cast three .
Troth Quarter-Master ,
This Trade is a kind of Mystery , that corrupts
Our standing Manners quickly : Once a Week ,
I meet with such a Brush to mollifie me .
Sometimes a Brace , to awake my Conscience ,
Yet still , I sleep securely .
Cousin Peck ,
You must use better dealing , faith you must .
Troth to give good Example to my Successors ,
I could be well content to steal but two Girts ,
And now and then a Saddle cloth , change a Bridle ,
For Exercise : and stay there .
If you could
There were some hope , on you , Couss .
But the Fate is
You 're drunk so early , you mistake whole Saddles :
Sometimes a Horse .
I there 's ? ?
The Wine , come Couss , I 'll talk with you anon .
Do , loose no time , good Quarter-Master .
There are the Horse , come , Fly .
Charge , in Boys , in ; Lieutenant o ' the Ordnance ,
Tobacco and Pipes .
Who 's that ?
Old Jordan , good !
A comely Vessel , and a necessary .
New-scour 'd he is : Here 's to thee , Martial Fly .
In Milk , my young Anon says .
Cream o ' the Grape !
That dropt from Juno 's Breasts , and sprung the Lilly !
I can recite your Fables , Fly , Here is , too ,
The Blood of Venus , Mother o ' the Rose !
The Dinner is gone up .
I hear the Whistle .
I , and the Fidlers .
We must all go wait .
Pox o ' this waiting , Quarter-Master , Fly .
When Chambermaids are Soveraigns , wait their Ladies .
Fly scorns to breath .
Or blow upon them , he .
Old Parcel Peck ! Art thou there ?
how now ?
lame ?
Yes faith : it is ill halting afore Criples ,
I ha' got a dash of a Jade , here , will stick by me .
O you have had some Phant 'sie , fellow Peck ,
Some Revelation ?
What ?
To steal the Hay ,
Out o ' the Racks again .
I told him so ,
When the Guests backs were turn 'd .
Or bring his Peck
The bottom upwards , heap 'd with Oats ; and cry ,
Here 's the best Measure upon all the Road ! when
You know the Guest , put in his Hand , to feel ,
And smell to the Oats , that grated all his Fingers
Upo ' the Wood--- Pec.
Mum ! Pei .
And found out your cheat .
I ha' been i' the Cellar , Peirce .
You were then there ,
Upo ' your Knees ; I do remember it :
To ha' the Fact conceal 'd .
I could tell more ,
Soping of Saddles , cutting of Horse Tails ,
And cropping ?
Pranks of Ale , and Hostelry ? ?
Which he cannot forget , he says , young Knight :
No more then you can other Deeds of Darkness ,
Done i' the Cellar .
Well said , bold Professor .
We shall ha' some truth explain 'd .
We are all mortal ,
And have our Visions .
Truly it seems to me
That every Horse has his whole Peck , and tumbles
Up to the Ears in Litter , Fly .
When , indeed
There 's no such Matter ; not a smell of Provender .
Not so much Straw as would tye up a Horse-tail !
Nor any thing i' the Rack , but two old Cob-webs !
And so much rotten Hay as had been a Hens Nest !
And yet he 's ever apt to sweep the Mangers !
But puts in nothing .
These are Fitsa nd Fancies .
Which you must leave , good Peck .
And you must pray
It may be reveal 'd to you at some times ,
Whose Horse you ought to cozen ; with what Conscience ;
The how ; and when , a Parsons Horse may suffer ?
Who 's Master 's double Benefic 'd ; put in that .
A little greasing i' the Teeth ; 'tis wholesom ;
And keeps him in a sober shuffle .
His Saddle too
May want a stirrop .
And , it may be sworn ,
His learning lay o ' one side , and so broke it ,
They have ever Oats i' their Cloak-bags , to affront us ,
Fly , And therefore 'tis an Office meritorious ,
To tithe such soundly .
And a Graziers may .
O they are pinching Puckfists ! Tru .
And suspicious .
Suffer before the Masters Face , sometimes .
He shall think he sees his Horse eat half a Bushel ,
Pei , When the slight is , rubbing his Gums with Salt ,
Till all the Skin come off , he shall but mumble ,
Like an old Woman that were chewing Brawn ,
And drop 'em out again .
Well argued Cavalier .
It may do well : and go for an Example :
But Couss , have care of understanding Horses ,
Horses with angry Heels , Nobility Horses ,
Horses that know the World ; let them have Meat
Till their Teeth ake ; and rubbing till their Ribs
Shine like a Wenches Forehead .
They are Divels else
Will look into your Dealings .
For mine own part ,
The next I cozen o ' the pampred breed ,
I wish he may be found 'red .
Prolate it right .
And of all Four , I wish it ,
I love no Crouper-complements .
Whose Horse was it ?
Why , Mr. Bursts .
Is Bat Burst come ?
An hour he has been here .
What Burst ?
Mas , Bartolmew Burst .
One that hath been a Citizen , since a Courtier ,
And now a Gamester .
Hath had all his Whirls ,
And bouts of Fortune , as a Man would say ,
Once a Bat and ever a Bat ! a Rere-mouse ,
And Bird o ' Twilight , he has broken thrice .
Your better Man , the Geno'way Proverb says ,
Men are not made of Steel .
Nor are they bound
Always to hold .
Thrice Honourable Colonel !
Hinges will crack .
Though they be Spanish Iron .
He is a Merchant still , Adventurer ,
At in and in ; and is our thorough-fares Friend .
Who ?
Jugs ?
The same : and a fine Gentleman
Was with him ! Pec.
Mr. Huffle .
Who ?
Hodge Huffle ?
What 's he ?
A Cheater , and another fine Gentleman ,
A Friend o ' the Chamberlains ! Jordans ! Mr. Huffle .
He is Burst 's Protection .
Fights , and vapours for him .
He will be drunk so civily .
So discreetly ?
And punctually ! just at his Hour .
And then ,
Call for his Jordan , with that hum and state ,
As if he piss 'd the Politicks ! Pei .
And sup
With his Tuft-taffata Night-gear , here , so silently !
Nothing but Musick ! Pei .
A dozen of bawdy Songs ,
And knows the General this ?
O no , Sir Dormit
Dormit Patronus , still , the Master sleeps .
They 'll steal to Bed .
In private Sir , and pay ,
The Fidlers with that modesty , next Morning .
Take a disiune of Muscadel and Eggs !
And pack away i' their trundling Cheats , like Gipsies .
Mysteries , mysteries , Ferret .
I we see , Trundle
What the great Officers in an Inn may do ;
I do not say the Officers of the Crown ,
But the Light-Heart .
I 'll see the Bat and Huffle .
I ha' some Business , Sir , I crave your Pardon ?
What ?
To be sober .
Pox , go get you gone then .
Trundle shall stay .
No I beseech you Colonel ,
You Lordship has a mind to be drunk private ,
With these brave Gallants ; I will step aside
Into
Into the Stables , and salute my Mares .
Yes , do , and sleep with 'em , let him go , base Whip-stock .
He 's as drunk as a Fish now , almost as dead .
Come I will see the flicker Mouse , my Flie .
assist of the Bench : The Lady and Lovel are brought in ,
and sit on the Two sides of the Stage , confronting each the
Ferret , Trundle .
HEre set the hour ; but first produce the parties ;
And clear the Court .
The time is now of price .
Jug , get you down , and Trundle get you up ,
You shall be Crier .
Ferret , here , the Clerk .
Jordan , smell you without , till the Ladies call you ;
Take down the Fiddlers too , silence that noise ,
Deep , i'the Cellar , safe .
Who keeps the Watch ?
Old Sheelinin here , is the Madam Tell-clock .
No fait and trot , sweet Maister , I shall sleep;
I fait I shall .
I prithee do then , Scrich-Owl .
She brings to mind the Fable o'the Dragon ,
That kept the Hesperian Fruit .
Would I could charm her .
Trundle will do it with his Hum .
Come Trundle .
Precede him Ferret , i'the form .
O yes , O yes , O yes ,
Whereas there hath been awarded ,
By the Queen Regent of Love .
In this high Court of Soveraignty ,

Ovid de arte amandi , That you neither have , ne will

pointed , or blunt , within these Lists , other than what

Arms , or Weapons , Stones of Vertue , Herb of Grace ,
Charm , Character , Spell , Philtre , or other Power than
Loves only , and the justness of your Cause .
So help you
Love , his Mother , and the Contents of this Book : Kiss
Return unto your Seats .
Crier bid silence .
O yes , O yes , O yes .
I'the name o'the Soveraign of Love ,
Notice is given by the Court ,
To the Appellant , and Defendant ,
That the first hour of Address proceeds .
And Love save the Soveraign .
I'the &c .
Notice is , &c .
To the Ap .
That the , &c .
And love , &c .
Every man or woman keep silence pain of imprisonment .
Do your endeavours in the name of Love .
To make my first Approaches , then , in Love .
Tell us what Love is , that we may be sure
There is such a thing , and that it is in nature .
Excellent Lady , I did not expect
To meet an Infidel ! much less an Atheist !
Here in Love 's Lists ! of so much unbelief !
To raise a Question of his being ? ?
Well charg 'd !
I rather thought , and , with Religion , think ,
Had all the Character of Love been lost ,
His Lines , Demensions , and whole Signature
Raz 'd and defac 'd , with dull humanity :
That both his Nature , and his Essence might
Have found their mighty instauration here ,
Here where the confluence of Fair and Good ,
Meets to make up all Beauty .
For , what else
Is Love , but the most noble , pure affection
Of what is truly Beautiful and Fair ?
Desire of union with the thing beloved ?
Have the Assistants of the Court their Votes ,
And writ of Priviledge , to speak them freely ? )
Yes , to assist ; but not to interrupt .
Then I have read somewhere , that man and woman ,
Were , in the first Creation , both one piece ,
And being cleft asunder , ever since ,
Love was an appetite to be rejoin 'd .
As for Example ?
Cramo-cree ! what mean 'sh tou ?
Only to kiss , and part .
So much is lawful .
And stands with the Prerogative of Loves Court !
It is a Fable of Plato 's , in his Banquet ,
And uttered there by Aristophanes .
' Twas well remembred here , and to good use . )
But on with your Description , what Love is .
Desire of union with the thing belov 'd .
I meant a Definition .
For I make
The efficient cause , what 's Beautiful , and Fair .
The formal cause , the appetite of Union .
The final cause the union it self .
But larger , if you 'll have it , by description :
It is a flame and ardour of the mind ,
Dead , in the proper Corps , quick in another 's :
Transfers the Lover into the Loved .
That he or she , that loves , engraves , or stamps
Th' Idea of what they love , first in themselves :
Or , like to Glasses , so their minds take in
The Forms of their belov 'd , and them reflect .
It is the likeness of Affections ,
Is both the parent and the nurse of Love .
Love is a spiritual coupling of two Souls ,
So much more excellent , as it least relates
Unto the Body ; circular , eternal ;
Not fain 'd , or made , but born : And then , so precious ,
As nought can value it , but it self .
So free
As nothing can command it but it self .
And in it self so round , and liberal ,
As where it favours , it bestows it self .
And that do I ; here my whole self I tender ,
According to the practice o'the Court .
I'tish a naughty practish , a lewd Practish ,
Be quiet man , dou shalt not leip her here .
Leap her ?
I lip her foolish Queen at Arms ,
Thy Blazon 's false : wilt thou blaspheme thine Office ? )
but we must take and understand this Love
Along still as a name of Dignity :
Not pleasure .
Mark you that , my light young Lord ? )
True love hath no unworthy thought , no light ,
Loose unbecoming Appetite , or Strain .
But fixed , constant , pure , immutable .
I relish not these Philosophical Feasts ;
Give me a Banquet o ' Sense , like that of Ovid :
A Form to take the Eye ; a Voice mine Ear ;
Pure Aromaticks , to my Scent ; a soft ,
Smooth , dainty Hand to touch ; and , for my taste ,
Ambrosiack Kisses to melt down the Palat . )
They are the earthly , lower form of Lovers ,
Are only taken with what strikes the Senses !
And love by that loose scale .
Altho I grant ,
We like what 's fair and graceful in an Object ,
And ( true ) would use it , in them all we tend to ,
Both of our civil and domestick deeds ,
In ordering of an Army , in our Stile ,
Apparel , Gesture , Building , or what not ?
All arts and actions do affect their Beauty .
But put the case , in travel I may meet
Some gorgeous Structure , a brave Frontispiece ,
Shall I stay Captive i' the outer Court ,
Surpriz 'd with that , and not advance to know
Who dwells there , and inhabiteth the House ?
There is my Friendship to be made , within ;
With what can love me again : not with the Walls ,
Doors , Windows , Architrabes , the Frieze , and Coronice .
My End is lost in loving of a Face ,
An Eye , Lip , Nose , Hand , Foot , or other part ,
Whose all is but a Statue , if the Mind
Move not , which only can make the return .
The End of Love is , to have Two made One
In will , and in affection , that the Minds
Be first inoculated , not the Bodies .
Gi' me the Body , if it be a good one .
Nay , sweet , my Lord , I must appeal the Soveraign
For better Quarter , if you hold your practice .
Silence , pain of Imprisonment : Hear the Court .
The Bodies Love is frail , subject to change ,
And alter still with it : The Mind 's is firm ,
One and the same , proceedeth first from weighing ,
And well examining what is fair and good ;
Then what is like in Reason , fit in Manners ;
That breeds good will : good will desire of Union .
So Knowledge first begets Benevolence ,
Benevolence breeds Friendship , Friendship loves :
And where it starts or steps aside from this ,
It is a meer degenerous appetite ,
A lost , oblique , deprav 'd affection ,
And bears no mark or character of Love .
How am I changed ! By what Alchimy
Of Love , or Language , am I thus translated !
His Tongue is tip 'd with the Philosophers Stone ,
And that hath touch 'd me through every Vein !
I feel that transmutation o ' my Blood ,
As I were quite become another creature ,
And all he speaks , it is Projection !
Well feign 'd , my Lady : now her Parts begin !
And she will act 'em subtilly .
She fails me else .
Nor do they trespass within bounds of pardon ,
That giving way , and license to their love ,
Divest him of his noblest Ornaments ,
Which are his Modesty , and Shamfac 'dness :
And so they do , that have unfit designs
Upon the Parties they pretend to love .
For what 's more monstrous , more a Prodigy ,
Than to hear me protest truth of affection
Unto a person that I would dishonour ?
And what 's a more dishonour , than defacing
Another 's good with forfeiting mine own ?
And drawing on a Fellowship of sin ;
From note of which , tho ( for a while ) we may
Be both kept safe , by caution , yet the Conscience
Cannot be cleans 'd .
For what was hitherto
Call 'd by the Name of Love , becomes destroy 'd
Then , with the Fact ; the Innocency lost ,
The bating of affection soon will follow :
And Love is never true that is not lasting .
No more than any can be pure or perfect ,
That entertains more than one Object , Dixi .
O speak , and speak for ever ! let min' ear
Be feasted still , and filled with this Banquet !
No sense can ever surfeit on such truth !
It is the Marrow of all Lovers Tenents !
Who hath read Plato , Heliodore , or Tatius ,
Sidney , D' Urs? , or all Loves Fathers , like him ?
He , is there the Master of the Sentences ,
Their School , their Commentary , Text , and Gloss ,
And breathes the true Divinity of Love !
And stood irregular , by all his Canons ?
But do you think she plays ?
Upo ' my Soveraignty ,
Mark her anon .
I shake , and am half jealous .
What Penance shall I do to be receiv 'd ,
And reconcil 'd to the Church of Love ?
Go on Procession , bare-foot , to his Image ,
And say some hundred penitential Verses ,
There , out of Chaucers Troilus , and Cresside ?
Or to his Mothers Shrine , vow a Wax-Candle
As large as the Town May-Pole is , and pay it !
Enjoyn me any thing this Court thinks fit ,
For I have trespass 'd , and blasphemed Love :
I have , indeed , despis 'd his Deity ,
Whom (till this Miracle wrought on me ) I knew not .
Now I adore Love , and would kiss the Rushes
That bear this Reverend Gentleman , his Priest ,
If that would expiate ? ? ?
but I fear it will not .
For , tho he be somewhat struck in years , and old
Enough to be my Father , he is wise ,
And only wise men love , the other covet .
I could begin to be in love with him ,
But will not tell him yet , because I hope
T' enjoy the other Hour with more delight ,
And prove him farther .
Most Socratick Lady !
Or , if you will Ironick ! gi' you joy
O' your Platonick Love here , Mr. Lovel .
But pay him his first Kiss , yet , i' the Court ,
Which is a Debt , and due : for the Hour 's run .
How swift is Time , and slily steals away
From them would hug it , value it , embrace it ?
I should have thought it scarce had run ten minutes ,
When the whole Hour is fled .
Here , take your Kiss , Sir ,
Which I most willing tender you in Court .
And we do imitate ? ? ?
And I could wish ,
It had been twenty ?
so the Soveraigns
Poor narrow Nature had decreed it so ? ?
But that is past , irrevocable , now :
She did her kind , according to her latitude ?
Beware , you do not conjure up a Spirit
You cannot lay .
I dare you , do your worst ,
Shew me but such an injustice : I would thank you
To alter your award .
Sure she is serious !
I shall have another fit of Jealousie !
I feel a grudging !
Chear up , Noble Ghest ,
We cannot guess what this may come to yet ;
The Brain of Man , or Woman , is uncertain !
Tut , she dissembles ! all is personated ,
And counterfeit comes from her ! If it were not ,
The Spanish Monarchy , with both the Indies ,
Could not buy off the treasure of this Kiss ,
Or half give balance for my happiness .
Why , as it is yet , it glads my light Heart
To see you rouz 'd thus from a sleepy humor
Of drouzy , accidental melancholy ;
And all those brave parts of your Soul awake ,
That did before seem drown 'd , and buried in you !
That you express your self , as you had back 'd
The Muses Horse ! or got Bellerophons arms !
What
What news with Fly ?
News of a newer Lady ,
A finer , fresher , braver , bonnier Beauty ,
A very bona Roba , and a Bouncer !
In yellow , glistering , golden Satten .
Pru ,
Adjourn the Court .
Cry , Trundle ? ?
O yes ,
Any Man , or Woman , that hath any personal attendance
To give unto the Court ; Keep the Second Hour ,
And Love save the Sov'raign .
Welcome , Barnabe ?
Where hast
thou been ?
I ' the foul weather .
Which has wet thee , Ban .
As dry as a chip ! Good Jug , a cast o ' thy Name ,
As well as thy Office : two Jugs !
By and by .
What Lady 's this thou hast brought here ?
A great Lady !
I know no more ; one that will try you , Jordan .
Shee 'll find your Gage , your Circle , your Capacity .
How do 's Old Staggers the Smith , and Tree the Sadler ?
Keep they their Penny-Club still ?
And th ' old Catch too ,
Of whoop Barnaby .
Do they sing at me ?
They are reeling at it in the Parlour now .
I 'll to 'em : Gi' me a drink first .
Where 's thy Hat ?
I lost it by the way ?
Gi' me another .
A Hat ?
A drink .
Take heed of taking cold , Ban ? ? ? ?
The wind blew't off at High-gate , and my Lady
Would not endure me light to take it up ,
But made me drive bare-headed i' the Rain .
That she might be mistaken for a Countess ?
Troth , like enough ! She might be an ore-grown
Dutchess ,
For ought I know .
What ! with one Man ! Bar .
At a time ,
They carry no more , the best of 'em .
Nor the bravest .
And she is very brave !
A stately Gown !
And Petticoat , she has on !
Ha' you spy 'd that , Jordan ?
You are a notable Peerer , an old Rabbi ,
At a Smocks-hem , Boy .
As he is Chamberlain ,
He may do that by his Place .
What 's her Squire ?
A toy , that she allows Eight Pence a day .
A slight Man-net , to port her up and down .
Come , shew me to my Play-fellows , Old Staggers ,
And Father Tree .
Here , this way , Barnabe .
Two Quarts , my Man of War , let us not be
Advance three Jordans , Varlet o ' the House .
I do not like your Burst Bird ; He is sawcy :
Some Shop-keeper he was ?
Yes , Sir . Tip .
I knew it ,
A broke-wing 'd Shop-keeper ?
I nose 'em streight .
He had no Father , I warrant him , that durst own him ;
Some Foundling in a Stall , or the Church-porch ;
Brought up i' the Hospital ; and so bound Prentice ;
Then Master of a Shop ; then one o ' th ' Inquest ;
Then breaks out Bankrupt , or starts Alderman :
The Original of both is a Church-Porch ? ?
Of some , my Colonel .
Good Faith , of most !
O' your Shop-Citizens , th ' are rude animals !
And let 'em get but ten mile out a Town ,
Th' out swagger all the Wapen-take .
What 's that ?
A Saxon word to signifie the Hundred .
Come let us drink , Sir Glorious , some brave
Health
Upon our tip-toes .
To the Health o ' the Bursts .
Why Bursts ?
Why Tipto 's ?
O' I cry you mercy !
It is sufficient .
What is so sufficient ?
To drink to you is sufficient .
On what terms ?
That you shall give Security to pledge me .
So you will name no Spaniard , I will pledge you .
I rather chuse to thirst ; and will thirst ever ,
Than leave that Cream of Nations un-cry 'd up .
Perish all Wine , and gust of Wine .
How ! spill it ?
Spill it at me ?
I wreck not , but I spilt it .
Nay , pray you be quiet , Noble Bloods .
No Spaniards ,
I cry , with my Cozen Huffle .
Spaniards ?
Pilchers ?
Do not provoke my patient Blade .
It sleeps ,
And would not hear thee : Huffle , thou art rude ,
And dost not know the Spanish composition .
What is the Recipe ?
Name the Ingredients .
Two Ounces !
Half a Dram !
A Penny weight !
Three Scruples !
And of Gravid?d .
A Face-full !
He carries such a Dose of it in his Looks ,
Will it give him Credit
With Gamesters , Courtiers , Citizens , or Tradesmen ?
He 'll borrow Money on the stroke of his Beard !
Or turn off his Mustaccio! His meer Cuello ,
Or Ruff about his Neck , is a Bill of Exchange
In any Bank in Europe ! Not a Merchant
That sees his Gate , but straight will furnish him
Upon his Pase !
I have heard the Spanish Name
Is terrible , to Children , in some Countries ;
And us 'd to make them eat their Bread and Butter ,
Or take their Worm-seed .
Huffle , you do shuffle :
To them , Stuffe , Pinnacia .
' Slid here 's a Lady !
And a Lady gay !
A well-trimm 'd Lady !
Let 's lay her aboard .
Let 's hail her first .
By your sweet Favour , Lady .
Good Gentlemen be civil , we are Strangers .
And you were Flemings , Sir !
Huf , Or Spaniards !
They are here , have been at Sevil i' their days ,
And at Madrid too ! Pin .
He is a foolish Fellow ,
I pray
I pray you mind him not , he is my Protection .
In your protection he is safe , sweet Lady .
So shall you be in mine .
A share , good Coronel .
Of what ?
Of your fine Lady ! I am Hodge ,
My Name is Huffle .
Huffling Hodge , be quiet .
And I pray you , be you so , Glorious Coronel
Hodge Huffle shall be quiet .
A Lady gay , gay :
For she is a Lady gay , gay , gay .
For she 's a Lady gay .
Bird o ' the Vespers , Vespertilio , Burst ;
You are a Gentleman o ' the first Head .
But that Head may be broke , as all the Body is ? ?
Burst , if you tie not up your Huffle quickly .
Tie Dogs , not Man .
Nay , pray thee , Hodge , be still .
This Steel here rides not on this Thigh in vain .
Shew 'st thou thy Steel and Thigh , thou glorious
Dirt ?
Then Hodge sings Sampson , and no ties shall hold .
? ? ? ?
Peirce , Jug , Jorden .
Keep the Peace , Gentlemen : what do you
mean ?
I will not discompose my self for Huffle .
You see what your Entreaty and Pressure still
Of Gentlemen , to be civil , doth bring on ?
A Quarrel ?
and perhaps Man-slaughter ?
You
Will carry your Goose about you still ?
your Planing-
Iron ?
Your Tongue to smooth all ! is not here fine stuff ?
Why Wife ?
Your Wife ?
Ha' not I forbidden you that ?
Do you think I 'll call you Husband i' this Gown ,
Or any thing in that Jacket , but Protection ?
Here tie my Shooe , and shew my Velvet Petticoat ,
And my Silk Stocking ! why do you make me a Lady ,
If I may not do like a Lady , in fine Cloathes .
Sweet Heart , you may do what you will with me .
I : I knew that at home ; what to do with you ;
But why was I brought hither ?
to see Fashions ?
And wear them too , Sweet Heart , but this wild
Company ? ?
Why do you bring me in wild Company ?
You 'd ha' me tame , and civil , in wild Company ?
I hope I know , wild Company are fine Company ,
And in fine Company , where I am fine my self ,
A Lady may do any thing , deny nothing
To a fine Party , I have heard you say 't .
To them Peirce .
There are a Company of Ladies above
Desire your Ladiships Company , and to take
The Surety of their Lodgings from the affront
Of these half Beasts , were here e 'en now , the Centaures .
Are they fine Ladies ?
Some very fine Ladies .
As fine as I ?
I dare use no Comparisons ,
Being a Servant , sent ? ? ? ?
Spoke , like a fine Fellow !
I would thou wert one ; I 'd not then deny thee :
But , thank my Lady .
? ? ? ?
To them Host .
Madam , I must crave you
To afford a Lady a Visit , would excuse
Some Harshness o ' the House , you have receiv 'd
From the brute Ghests .
This 's a fine Old Man !
I'ld go with him an' he were a little finer !
You may , Sweet Heart , it is mine Host .
Mine Host !
Yes , Madam , I must bid you welcome .
Do then .
But do not stay ,
I 'll be advis 'd by you ; yes !
WHat more than Thracian Barbarism was this !
The Battel o ' the Centaures , with the
Lapithes !
There is no taming o ' the Monster Drink .
But what a glorious Beast our Tipto shew 'd !
He would not discompose himself , the Don !
Your Spaniard ne 'er doth discompose himself .
Yet , how he talkt , and roar 'd i' the beginning !
And ran as fast as a knock 'd Marro'bone .
So they did all at last , when Lovel went down ,
And chas 'd 'em 'bout the Court .
For all 's Don Lewis !
Or fencing after Euclide ! Lad .
I ne 'er saw
A lightning shoot so , as my Servant did ,
His Rapier was a Meteor , and he wav 'd it
Over 'em , like a Comet , as they fled him !
I mark 'd his Manhood ! every stoop he made
Was like an Eagles at a Flight of Cranes !
( As I have read somewhere . )
Bravely exprest .
And like a Lover !
Of his Valour , I am !
He seem 'd a Body , rarifi 'd to air !
Or that his Sword , and arm were of a peice ,
They went together so ! Here comes the Lady .
A bouncing Bona roba ! as the Fly said .
She is some Giantess ! I 'll stand off ,
For fear she swallow me .
Is not this our Gown , Pru ?
That I bespoke of Stuffe ?
It is the Fashion !
I , and the Silk ! Feel : sure it is the same !
And the same Petticoat , Lace , and all !
I 'll swear it .
How came it hither ?
make a Bill of Inquiry .
Yo ' have a fine Sute on , Madam ! and a rich one
And of a curious making !
And a new !
As new as Day .
She answers like a Fish-Wife !
I put it on since Noon , I do assure you .
Who is your Taylor ?
'Pray you , your Fashioners Name .
My Fashioner is a certain Man o ' mine own ,
He is i' the House : no matter for his Name .
O , but to satisfie this bevy of Ladies ,
Of which a Brace , here , long 'd to bid you welcome .
He is one , in truth , I title my Protection :
Bid him come up .
Our new Ladies Protection !
What is your Ladiships Stile ?
Countess Pinnacia .
Countess Pinnacia 's Man , come to your Lady !
Your Ladiships Taylor ! Mass , Stuffe !
How Stuffe ! He the Protection !
Stuffe looks like a Remnant .
I am undone , discover 'd !
' Tis the Suit , Madam ,
Now , without Scruple ! and this some Device
To bring it home with .
B b b b b Pin .
Why upon your Knees ?
Is this your Lady Godmother ?
Mum , Pinnacia .
It is the Lady Frampul ; my best Customer .
What Shew is this that you present us with ?
I do beseech your Ladiship forgive me .
She did but say the Suit on .
Who ?
Which she ?
My Wife , forsooth .
How ?
Mistress Stuffe ?
Your Wife !
Is that the Riddle ?
We all look 'd for a Lady ,
A Dutchess , or a Countess at the least .
She is my own lawfully begotten Wife ,
In Wedlock .
We ha' been coupled now seven years .
And why thus masqu 'd ?
You like a Footman , ha !
And she your Countess ! Pin .
To make a Fool of himself ,
And of me too .
I pray thee , Pinnace , peace .
Nay , it shall out , since you have call 'd me Wife ,
And openly dis-Ladied me ! though I am dis-Countess 'd
I am not yet dis-countenanc 'd .
These shall see .
Silence !
It is a foolish trick , Madam , he has ;
For though he be your Taylor , he is my Beast .
I may be bold with him , and tell his Story .
When he makes any fine Garment will fit me ,
Or any rich thing that he thinks of price ,
Then must I put it on , and be his Countess ,
Before he carry it home unto the Owners .
A Coach is hir 'd , and Four Horses ; he runs
In his Velvet Jacket thus , to Rumford , Croyden ,
Hounslow , or Barnet , the next bawdy Road :
And takes me out , carries me up , and throw 's me
Upon a Bed .
Peace , thou immodest Woman .
She glories in the Bravery o ' the Vice .
' Tis a queint one ! Bea .
A fine species ,
Of fornicating with a Man 's own Wife ,
Found out by ( what 's his Name ? )
Mr. Nic .
The very Figure of Preoccupation
In all his Customers best Cloathes .
He lies
With his own Succuba , in all your Names .
And all your Credits .
I , and at all their costs .
This Gown was then bespoken for the Soveraign ?
I , marry was it .
And a main Offence
Committed 'gainst the Soveraignty ; being not brought
Home i' the time .
Beside , the prophanation ,
Which may call on the Censure of the Court .
Let him be blanketed .
Call up the Quarter-
Deliver him o 'er to Fly .
O good , my Lord .
Pillage the Pinnace .
Let his Wife be stript .
Blow off her Upper Deck .
Tear all her Tackle .
Pluck the polluted Robes over her Ears ;
Or cut them all to peices , make a fire o ' them .
To Rags and Cinders , burn th ' idolatrous Vestures .
Fly , and your Fellows , see that the whole censure
Be throughly executed .
We 'll toss him bravely ,
Till the stuff stink again .
And send her home ,
Divested to her Flannel , in a Cart .
And let her Footman beat the Bason afore her .
The Court shall be obey 'd .
Fly , and his Officers ,
Will do it fiercely .
Merciful Queen Pru .
I cannot help you .
Go thy ways , Nic .
Stuffe ,
Thou hast nickt it for a Fashioner of Venery !
For his own Hell , though he run ten mile for't .
O , here comes Lovel , for his second Hour .
And after him the type of Spanish Valour .
SErvant , what have you there ?
A Meditation ,
Or rather a Vision , Madam , and of Beauty ,
Our former Subject .
Pray you let us hear it .
It was a Beauty that I saw
So pure , so perfect , as the frame
Of all the Universe was lame ,
To that one Figure could I draw ,
Or give least line of it a law !
A Skein of Silk without a Knot !
A fair March made without a Halt !
A curious Form without a Fault !
A printed book without a blot .
All beauty , and without a spot .
They are gentle Words , and would deserve a
Note ,
Set to 'em , as gentle .
I have try 'd my Skill .
To close the second Hour , if you will hear them ,
My Boy by that time will have got it perfect .
Yes , gentle Servant .
In what calm he speaks ,
After this noise and tumult , so unmov 'd ,
With that serenity of countenance ,
As if his thoughts did acquiesce in that
Which is the Object of the second Hour ,
And nothing else .
Well then , summon the Court .
I have a Sute to the Soveraign of Love ,
If it may stand with the Honour of the Court ,
To change the Question but from Love to Valour ,
To hear it said , but what true Valour is ,
Which oft begets true Love .
It is a Question
Fit for the Court to take true knowledge of ,
And hath my just assent .
I am content , give him his Oath .
Herebert Lovel , Thou shalt swear upon the Testa -
ment of Love , To make Answer to this Question propounded
to thee by the Court , What true Valour is ?
And therein to tell
the Truth , the whole Truth , and nothing but the Truth .
So
help thee Love , and thy bright Sword at need .
So help me Love , and my good Sword at need .
It is the greatest Vertue , and the Safety
Of all Mankind , the Object of it is danger .
A certain Meen 'twixt Fear and Confidence :
No inconsiderate Rashness , or vain appetite
Of false encountring formidable things ;
But a true Science of distinguishing
What 's good or evil .
It springs out of Reason ,
And tends to perfect Honesty , the Scope
Is always Honour , and the Publick Good :
It is no Valour for a private Cause .
No ?
not for Reputation ?
That 's Man 's Idol ,
Set up against God , the Maker of all Laws ,
Who hath commanded us we should not kill ;
And yet we say , we must for Reputation .
What honest Man can either fear his own ,
Or else will hurt another 's Reputation ?
Fear to do base , unworthy things , is Valour ;
If they be done to us , to suffer them ,
Is Valour too .
The Office of a Man
That 's truly Valiant , is considerable
Three ways : The first is in respect of Matter ,
Which still is danger ; in respect of Form ,
Wherein he must preserve his Dignity ;
And in the End , which must be ever lawful .
But Men , when they are heated , and in passion ,
Cannot consider .
Then it is not Valour .
I ne -
I never thought an angry person valiant :
Vertue is never aided by a Vice .
What need is there of anger , and of tumult ?
When reason can do the same things , or more ?
O yes , 'tis profitable , and of use ,
It makes us fierce , and fit to undertake .
Why , so will Drink make us both bold and rash ,
Or phrensie if you will , do these make valiant ?
They are poor helps , and Vertue needs them not .
No Man is valianter by being angry ,
But he that could not valiant be without :
So that it comes not in the aid of Vertue ,
But in the stead of it .
He holds the right .
And 'tis an odious kind of Remedy ,
To owe our health to a disease .
If Man
Should follow the Dictamen of his Passion ,
He could not scape ? ? ?
To discompose himself .
According to Don Lewis !
Or Caranza !
Good Colonel Glorious , whilst we treat of Valour ,
Dismiss your self .
You are not concern 'd .
Go drink ,
And congregate the Hostlers and the Tapsters ,
The Under-Officers o ' your Regiment ;
Compose with them , and be not angry valiant ?
How do 's that differ from true Valour ?
In the Efficient , or that which makes it :
For it proceeds from Passion , not from Judgment :
Then brute beasts have it , wicked persons : there
It differs in the Subject ; in the Form ,
' Tis carried rashly , and with Violence :
Then i' the End , where it respects not Truth ,
Or Publick Honesty ; but meer Revenge .
Now confident , and undertaking Valour ,
Sways from the true , two other ways , as being
A trust in our own Faculties , Skill , or Strength ,
And not the Right , or Conscience o ' the Cause ,
That works it : Then i' the End , which is the Victory ,
And not the Honour .
But the ignorant Valour ,
That knows not why it undertakes , but doth it
T' escape the Infamy meerly ? ? ?
Is worst of all :
That Valour lies i' the Eyes o ' the lookers on ;
And is call 'd Valour with a witness .
The things true Valour is exercis 'd about ,
Are Poverty , Restraint , Captivity ,
Banishment , loss of Children , long Disease :
The least is Death .
Here Valour is beheld ,
Properly seen ; about these it is present :
Not trivial things , which but require our Confidence .
And , yet to those , we must object our selves ,
Only for Honesty : if any other
Respect be mixt , we quite put out her light .
And as all Knowledge , when it is remov 'd ,
Or separate from Justice , is call 'd Craft ,
Rather than Wisdom : So a Mind affecting ,
Or undertaking dangers , for ambition ,
Or any Self-Pretext , not for the Publick ,
Deserves the Name of Daring , not of Valour .
And over-daring is as great a Vice ,
As over-fearing .
Yes , and often greater .
But as it is not the meer Punishment ,
But Cause , that makes a Martyr , so it is not
Fighting , or dying ; but the manner of it
Renders a Man himself .
A Valiant Man
Ought not to undergo , or tempt a danger ,
But worthily , and by selected ways
He undertakes with Reason , not by Chance .
His Valour is the Salt to his other Vertues ,
They are all unseason 'd without it .
The Waiting-maids ,
Or the Concomitants of it , are his Patience ,
His Magnanimity , his Confidence ,
His Constancy , Security , and Quiet ;
He can assure himself against all Rumor !
Despairs of nothing ! laughs at Contumelies !
As knowing himself advanced in a height
Where injury cannot reach him , nor aspersion
Touch him with Soyle !
Most manly utter 'd all :
As if Achilles had the Chair in Valour ,
And Hercules were but a Lecturer !
Who would not hang upon those lips for ever !
That strike such Musick ?
I could run on them ;
But Modesty is such a School-mistriss ,
To keep our Sex in awe .
Or you can fain ; my
Subtle and dissembling Lady Mistriss .
I fear she means it , Pru , in too good earnest !
The purpose of an Injury 'tis to vex
And trouble me : now nothing can do that
To him that 's valiant .
He that is assected
With the least Injury , is less than it .
It is but reasonable to conclude
That should be stronger , still , which hurts , than that
Which is hurt .
Now no Wickedness is stronger
Than what opposeth it : Not Fortunes self ,
When she encounters Vertue , but comes off
Both lame and less ! Why should a Wise Man then
Confess himself the weaker , by the feeling
Of a Fool 's wrong ?
There may an Injury
Be meant me .
I may chuse , if I will take it .
But we are , now come to that delicacy
And tenderness of sense , we think an insolence
Worse than an injury , bare words worse than deeds ;
We are not so much troubled with the wrong ,
As with the Opinion of the wrong ; like Children ,
We are made afraid with Visors ! Such poor sounds
As is the lie , or common words of Spight .
Wise Laws thought never worthy a Revenge ;
And 'tis the narrowness of Humane Nature ,
Our Poverty , and Beggery of Spirit ,
To take exception at these things .
He laugh 'd at me !
He broke a Jest ! a third took place of me !
How most ridiculous Quarrels are all these ?
Notes of a queasie , and sick Stomach , labouring
With want of a true injury ! the main part
Of the wrong , is our Vice of taking it .
Or our interpreting it to be such .
You take it rightly .
If a Woman , or Child
Give me the Lie , would I be angry ?
No,
Not if I were i' my Wits , sure I should think it
No spice of a disgrace .
No more is theirs ,
If I will think it , who are to be held
In as contemptible a Rank , or worse .
I am kept out a Masque , sometime thrust out ,
Made wait a day , two , three , for a great Word ,
Which ( when it comes forth ) is all frown , and forehead !
What laughter should this breed , rather than anger !
Out of the tumult of so many Errors ,
To feel , with contemplation , mine own quiet !
If a great Person do me an affront ,
A Giant of the time , sure I will bear it
Or out of Patience , or Necessity !
Shall I do more for Fear , than for my Judgment ?
For me now to be angry with Hodge Huffle ,
Or Burst ( his broken charge , ) if he be saucy ,
Or our own type of Spanish Valour , Tipto ,
( Who were he now necessitated to beg
Would ask an Alms , like Conde Olivares )
Were just to make my self , such a vain Animal
As one of them .
If light wrongs touch me not ,
No more shall great ; if not a few , not many .
There 's nought so sacred with us but may find
A sacrilegious Person , yet the thing is
B b b b b 2 No
No less divine , 'cause the prophane can reach it .
He is Shot-free , in Battel is not hurt ,
Not he that is not hit .
So he is Valiant ,
That yields not unto wrongs ; not he that scapes 'em :
They that do pull down Churches , and deface
The holiest Altars , cannot hurt the God-head .
A calm wise Man may shew as much true Valour ,
Amid 'st these popular provocations ,
As can an able Captain shew security ,
By his brave Conduct , through an Enemies Country .
A wise Man never goes the Peoples way ,
But as the Planets still move contrary
To the World 's Motion ; so doth he , to Opinion :
He will examine , if those accidents
( Which common Fame calls injuries ) happen to him
Deservedly , or no ?
Come they deservedly ,
They are no Wrongs then , but his Punishments :
If undeservedly , and he not guilty ,
The doer of them , first , should blush , not he .
Excellent ! Bea .
Truth , and right ! Fra .
An Oracle
Could not have spoken more !
Been more believ 'd !
The whole Court runs into your Sentence , Sir !
And see , your second hour is almost ended .
It cannot be ! O clip the Wings of Time ,
Good Pru , or make him stand still with a Charm .
Distil the Gout into it , Cramps , all Diseases
T' arrest him in the Foot , and fix him here :
O , for an Engine , to keep back all Clocks !
Or make the Sun forget his Motion !
If I but knew what Drink the Time now lov 'd ,
To set my Trundle at him , mine own Barnabe !
Why ?
I 'll consult our Shelee nien , To-mas .
Er grae Chreest .
Wake her not .
Tower een Cuppan
D'usque bagh doone .
Usque bagh 's her Drink .
But 'twi ' not make the time drunk .
As't hath her .
Away with her , my Lord , but marry her first , Pru .
I , that 'll be sport anon too for my Lady .
But she hath other Game to fly at yet :
The Hour is come , your Kiss .
My Servants Song , first .
I say the Kiss , first ; and I so enjoyn 'd it :
At your own peril , do , make the contempt .
Well , Sir , you must be pay 'd , and legally .
Nay , nothing , Sir , beyond .
One more ? ? ?
I except .
This was but half a Kiss , and I would change it .
The Court 's dissolv 'd , remov 'd , and the Play
No sound , or air of Love more , I decree it .
From what a Happiness hath that one Word
Thrown me into the Gulf of Misery ?
To what a bottomless Despair ?
how like
A Court removing , or an ended Play
Shews my abrupt precipitate Estate ,
By how much more my vain hopes were increas 'd
By these false Hours of Conversation ?
Did not I prophesie this of my self ,
And gave the true Prognosticks ?
o ' my Brain !
How art thou turned ! and my Blood congeal 'd !
My Sinews slackned ! and my Marrow melted !
That I remember not where I have been ,
Or what I am ?
Only my tongue 's on fire ;
And burning downward , hurls forth Coals and Cinders ,
To tell , this Temple of Love , will soon be ashes !
Come Indignation , now , and be my Mistress ,
No more of Love 's ingrateful tyranny .
His Wheel of Torture , and his Pits of Bird-lime ,
His Nets of Nooses , Whirl-pools of Vexation ,
His Mils , to grind his Servants into Powder ? ? ?
I will go catch the Wind first in a Sieve ,
Weigh Smoak , and measure Shadows , plough the Water .
And sow my Hopes there , e 're I stay in Love .
My Jealousie is off , I am now secure .
Farewel the craft of Crododiles , Womens Piety ,
And practise of it , in this art of flattering ,
And fooling Men , I ha' not lost my Reason ,
Though I have lent my self out for two hours ,
Thus to be baffl 'd by a Chambermaid ,
Who I ?
Laugh on , Sir , I 'll to bed , and sleep ,
And dream away the Vapour of Love , if th ' House
And your leere Drunkards let me .
Sweet Madam .
Why would you let him go thus ?
In whose power
Was it to stay him , prop'rer than my Ladies !
Why , in her Ladies ?
Are not you the Soveraign ?
Would you , in conscience , Madam , ha' me vex
His Patience more ?
Not but apply the cure ,
Now it is vex't .
That 's but one bodies work :
Two cannot do the same thing handsomely .
But had not you the authority absolute ?
And were not you i' rebellion , Lady Frampul ,
From the beginning ?
I was somewhat froward ,
I must confess , but frowardness sometime
Becomes a Beauty , being but a Visor
Put on .
You 'll let a Lady wear her Masque , Pru .
But how do I know , when her Ladiship is pleas 'd
To leave it off , except she tell me so ?
You might ha' known that by my looks , and
language ,
Had you been or regardant , or observant .
One Woman , reads anothers Character ,
Without the tedious trouble of deciphering :
If she but give her mind to't , you knew well ,
It could not sort with any Reputation
Of mine , to come in first , having stood out
So long , without Conditions for mine Honour .
I thought you did expect none , you so jeer 'd him
And put him off with scorn ? ? ?
Who , I , with scorn ?
I did express my Love to Idolatry rather ,
And so am justly plagu 'd , not understood .
I swear , I thought you had dissembled , Madam ,
And doubt you do so yet .
Dull , stupid , Wench !
Stay i' thy state of ignorance still , be damn 'd ,
An Idiot Chambermaid ! Hath all my Care ,
My breeding thee in Fashion , thy Rich Clothes ,
Honours , and Titles wrought no brighter Effects
On thy dark Soul than thus ?
Well ! go thy ways ,
Were not the Taylor 's Wife , to be demolish 'd ,
Ruin 'd , uncas 'd , thou should 'st be she , I vow .
Why , take your spangled Properties , your Gown
And Scarfs .
What dost thou mean ?
I will not buy this Play-boy 's Bravery ,
At such a Price , to be upbraided for it ,
Thus , every minute .
Take it not to Heart so .
The Taylor 's Wife ?
There was a word of scorn !
It was a word fell from me , Pru , by chance .
Good Madam , please to undeceive your self ,
I know when words do slip , and when they are darted
With all their bitterness : uncas 'd , demolish 'd ?
An Idiot ?
Chambermaid , stupid , and dull ?
Be damn 'd for ignorance ?
I will be so ;
And think I do deserve it , that , and more ,
Much more I do .
Here comes mine Host ! No crying !
Good Pru .
Where is my Servant Lovel , Host ?
Yo ' ha' sent him up to bed , would you would
follow him !
And make my House amends !
Would
Would you advise it ?
I would I could command it .
My light Heart
Should leap till midnight .
Pray thee be not sullen ,
I yet must ha' thy counsel .
Thou shalt wear , Pru ,
The new Gown yet .
After the Taylor 's Wife ?
Come , be not angry , or griev 'd : I have a Project .
Wake Sheleenien Thomas ! Is this your Heraldry ?
And keeping of Records , to lose the main ?
Where is your Charge ?
Gra chreest ! Hos .
Go ask th ' Oracle
O' the Bottle , at your Girdle , there you lost it :
You are a sober setter of the Watch .
Prime Insect of the Inn , Professor , Quarter-master ,
As ever thou deserved 'st thy daily Drink ,
Padling in Sack , and licking i' the same ,
Now shew thy self an Implement of Price ,
And help to raise a Nap to us , out of nothing .
Thou saw 'st 'em married ?
I do think I did ,
And heard the words , Philip , I take thee , L?tice .
I gave her too , was then the Father Fly ,
And heard the Priest do his part , far as five Nobles
Would lead him i' the Lines of Matrimony .
Where were they married ?
I ' the new Stable .
Ominous !
I ha' known many a Church been made a Stable ,
But not a Stable made a Church till now :
I wish 'em Joy .
Fly , was he a full Priest ?
He belly 'd for it , had his Velvet Sleeves ,
And his branch 'd Cassock , a side sweeping Gown ,
All his Formalities , a good cramm 'd Divine !
I went not far to fetch him , the next Inn ,
Where he was lodg 'd , for the action .
Had they a License !
License of Love , I saw no other , and Purse ,
To pay the Duties both of Church and House ;
The Angels flew about .
Those Birds send luck :
And Mirth will follow .
I had thought to ha' sacrific 'd ,
To merriment to night , i' my light Heart , Fly ,
And like a Noble Poet , to have had
My last act best : but all fails i' the Plot .
Lovel is gone to bed ; the Lady Frampull
And Soveraign Pru fall 'n out : Tipto and his Regiment
Of Mine-men , all drunk dumb , from his Whoop Barnaby ,
To his Hoop Trundle : They are his two Tropicks .
No project to rear laughter on , but this ,
The Marriage of Lord Beaufort , with L?titia .
Stay ! what 's here ! The Sattin Gown redeem 'd !
And Pru restor 'd in't , to her Ladies Grace !
She is set forth in't ! rig 'd for some Imployment !
An Embassy at least !
Some treaty of State !
' Tis a fine tack about ! and worth the observing .
These Robes do royally ! and thou becom 'st 'em !
So they do thee ! rich Garments only fit
The Parties they are made for ! they shame others .
How did they shew on Gooddy Taylor 's back !
Like a Caparison for a Sow , God save us !
Thy putting 'em on hath purg 'd , and hallow 'd 'em
From all pollution , meant by the Mechanicks .
Hang him , poor Snip , a Secular Shop-wit !
H' hath nought but his Sheers to claim by , and his
measures ,
His Prentice may as well put in for his Needle ,
And plead a stitch .
They have no taint in 'em
Now o ' the Taylor .
Yes , of his Wives Hanches .
Thus thick of Fat ; I smell 'em , o ' the say .
It is restorative , Pru ! with thy but chasing it ,
A barren Hinds Grease may work Miracles ,
Find but his Chamber-door , and he will rise
To thee ! or if thou pleasest , fain to be
The wretched Party her self , and com 'st unto him
In forma pauperis , to crave the aid
Of his Knight-Errant Valour , to the rescue
Of thy distressed Robes ! name but thy Gown ,
And he will rise to that ! Pru .
I 'll fire the Charm first ,
I had rather die in a Ditch , with Mistress Shore ,
Without a Smock , as the pittiful matter has it ,
Than owe my Wit to Cloathes , or ha' it beholden .
Still Spirit of Pru !
And smelling o ' the Soveraign !
No, I will tell him , as it is indeed ;
I come from the fine , froward , Frampul Lady ,
One was run mad with Pride , wild with self-love ,
But late encountring a wise Man , who scorn 'd her ,
And knew the way to his own Bed , without
Borrowing her Warming-pan , she hath recover 'd
Part of her Wits ; so much as to consider
How far she hath trespass 'd , upon whom , and how .
And now sits penitent and solitary ,
Like the forsaken Turtle , in the Volary
Of the light Heart , the Cage , she hath abus 'd ,
Mourning her Folly , weeping at the height
She measures with her Eye , from whence she is fall 'n ,
Since she did branch it , on the top o ' the Wood .
I pr'y thee , Pru , abuse me enough , that 's use me
As thou thinkest fit , any course way , to humble me ,
Or bring me home again , or Lovel on :
Thou doest not know my sufferings , what I feel ,
My fires and fears are met ; I burn and freeze ,
My Liver 's one great Coal , my Heart shrunk up
With all the fivers , and the Mass of Blood
Within me , is a standing lake of fire ,
Curl 'd with the cold Wind of my gelid Sighs ,
That drive a drift of Sleet through all my Body ,
And shoot a February through my Veins .
Until I see him , I am drunk with thirst ,
And surfeited with hunger of his Presence .
I know not where I am , or no , or speak ,
Or whether thou dost hear me .
Spare Expressions .
I 'll once more venture for your Ladiship ,
So you will use your Fortunes reverendly .
Religiously , dear Pru , Love and his Mother ,
I 'll build them several Churches , Shrines and Altars ,
And over head , I 'll have , in the Glass Windows ,
The story of this Day be painted , round ,
For the poor Laity of Love to read .
I 'll make my self their Book , nay , their Example ,
To bid them take Occasion by the Forelock ,
And play no after-games of Love , hereafter .
And hear your Host , and 's Fly , witness your Vows ,
And like two lucky Birds , bring the Presage
Of a loud Jest : Lord Beaufort married is .
Ha !
All to be married .
To whom , not your Son ?
The same Pru .
If her Ladiship could take truce
A little with her Passion , and give way
To their Mirth now running .
Run 's it Mirth , let 's come ,
It shall be well receiv 'd and much made of it .
We must of this , it was our own conception .
ROom for green Rushes , raise the Fidler 's Cham -
berlain ,
Call up the House in arms .
This will rouze Lovel .
And bring him on too .
Runs like a Heifer , bitten with the Brieze ,
About the Court , crying on Fly , and cursing .
For what , my Lord ?
Yo ' were best hear that from her ,
It is no Office , Fly , fits my Relation .
Here come the happy Couple ! Joy , Lord Beaufort .
And my young Lady too .
Much Joy , my Lord !
IThank you all ; I thank thee , Father Fly .
Madam , my Cousin , you look discompos 'd ,
I have been bold with a Sallad , after Supper ,
O' your own Lettice here .
You have , my Lord .
But Laws of Hospitality , and fair Rites ,
Would have made me acquainted .
I ' your own House ,
I do acknowledge : Else I much had trespass 'd .
But in an Inn , and publick , where there is License
Of all Community : a Pardon o ' course
May be su 'd out .
It will , my Lord , and carry it .
I do not see , how any storm , or tempest
Can help it now .
The thing being done , and past ,
You bear it wisely , and like a Lady of Judgment .
She is that Secretary Pru .
Why Secretary ,
My wise Lord ?
is your Brain lately married !
Your Reign is ended , Pru , no Sovereign now :
Your date is out , and Dignity expir 'd .
I am annull 'd , how can I treat with Lovel ,
Without a new Commission ?
Thy Gown 's Commission .
Have Patience , Pru , expect , bid the Lord Joy .
And this brave Lady too .
I wish them Joy .
All Joy .
I , the House full of Joy .
Play the Bels ; Fidlers , crack your strings with Joy .
But Lady Letice , you shewd a neglect
Un-to-be-pardo n 'd , to 'ards my Lady , your Kinswoman
Not to advise with her .
Good politick Pru ,
Urge not your State-advice , your after-wit ;
' Tis near upbraiding .
Get our Bed ready , Chamberlain ,
And Host , a Bride-cup , you have rare Conceits ,
And good Ingredients ; ever an old Host
Upo ' the Road , has his provocative Drinks .
He is either a good Baud , or a Physician .
' Twas well he heard you not , his back was turn 'd .
A bed , the Genial Bed , a brace of Boys
To night I play for .
Give us Points , my Lord .
Here , take 'em , Pru , my Cod-piece Point , and all .
I ha' Clasps , my Letice arms , here take 'em , boys .
What , is the Chamber ready ?
Speak , why stare you
On one another ?
No, Sir . Bea .
And why no ?
My Master has forbid it .
He yet doubts
That you are married .
Ask his Vicar General ,
His Fly , here .
I must make that good , they are married .
But I must make it bad , my hot young Lord .
Gi' him his Doublet again , the air is piercing ;
You may take cold , my Lord .
See whom you ha' mar-
ried ,
Your Host 's Son , and a Boy .
You are abus 'd .
Much Joy , my Lord .
If this be your L?titia ,
She 'll prove a counterfeit Mirth , and a clip 'd Lady .
A Boy , a Boy ; my Lord has married a Boy .
Raise all the House in shout , and laughter , a Boy !
Stay , what is here ! peace , Rascals , stop your
THat Maggot , Worm , that Insect ! O my Child ,
My Daughter ! where 's that Fly ?
I 'll fly in his face ,
The Vermin , let me come to him .
Why Nurse Sheelee ?
Hang thee , thou Parasite , thou Son of Crumbs ,
And Orts , thou hast undone me , and my Child ,
My Daughter , my dear Daughter .
What means this ?
O Sir , my Daughter , my dear Child is ruin 'd ,
By this your Fly , here , married in a stable ,
And sold unto a Husband .
Stint thy cry ,
Harlot , if that be all , did 'st thou not sell him
To me for a Boy ?
and brought 'st him in Boys Rags
Here to my door , to beg an alms of me ?
I did , good Master , and I crave your pardon ;
But 'tis my Daughter , and a Girl .
Why said 'st thou
It was a Boy , and sold 'st him then to me
With such intreaty , for Ten Shillings , Carlin ?
Because you were a charitable man
I heard , good Master , and would breed him well ,
I would ha' giv'n him you , for nothing gladly .
Forgive the lie o ' my mouth , it was to save
The Fruit o ' my Womb .
A Parents needs are urgent ,
And few do know that tyrant o 're good Natures .
But you reliev 'd her , and me too , the Mother ,
And took me into your House to be the Nurse ,
For which Heaven heap all blessings on your Head ,
Whilst there can one be added .
Sure thou speak 'st
Quite like another creature than th ' hast liv 'd ,
Here , i' the House , a Sheelee-neen Thomas ,
An Irish Beggar .
So I am , God help me .
What art thou ?
Tell : The match is a good match ,
For ought I see : Ring the Bells once again .
Stint , I say , Fidlers .
No going off , my Lord .
Nor coming on , sweet Lady , things thus standing !
But what 's the heinousness of my Offence ?
Or the degrees of wrong you suffer 'd by it ?
In having your Daughter match't thus happily ,
Into a noble House , a brave young Blood ,
And a prime Peer o ' the Realm ?
Was that your Plot , Fly ?
Gi' me a Cloak , take her again among you .
I 'll none o ' your Light-Heart Fosterlings , no Inmates ,
Supposititious Fruits of an Host 's Brain ,
And his Fly 's hatching , to be put upon me .
There is a Royal Court o ' the Star-Chamber ,
Will scatter all these mists , disperse these Vapours ,
And clear the truth .
Let Beggars match with Beggars ,
That shall decide it .
I will try it there .
Nay then , my Lord , it 's not enough , I see
You are licentious , but you will be wicked .
Yo ' are not alone content to take my Daughter ,
Against the Law ; but having taken her ,
You would repudiate , and cast her off ,
Now , at your pleasure , like a Beast of Power ,
VVithout all Cause , or colour of a Cause ,
That , or a Noble , or an Honest Man ,
Should dare t ' except against her Poverty .
Is Poverty a Vice ?
Th' age counts it so .
God help your Lordship , and your Peers that
think so ,
If any be : if not , God bless them all ,
And
And help the number o ' the vertuous ,
If Poverty be a Crime .
You may object
Our Beggery to us , as an accident ,
But never deeper , no inherent baseness .
And I must tell you , now , young Lord of Dirt ,
As an incensed Mother , she hath more
And better Blood , running i' those small Veins ,
Than all the Race of Beauforts have in mass ,
Though they distil their drops from the left Rib
Of John o ' Gaunt .
Old Mother o ' Records ,
Thou know 'st her Pedigree then : whose Daughter is she ?
The Daughter and Co-heir to the Lord Frampul ,
This Ladies Sister ! Lad .
Mine ?
what is her Name ?
That was lost !
The true L?titia .
Sister , O gladness ! Then you are our Mother ?
I am , dear Daughter .
On my Knees I bless
The light I see you by .
And to the author
Of that blest light , I ope my other Eye ,
Which hath almost , now , seven year been shut ,
Dark , as my Vow was , never to see light ,
Till such a light restor 'd it , as my Children ,
Or your dear Father , who ( I hear ) is not .
Give me my Wife , I own her now , and will
have her .
But you must ask my leave first , my young Lord .
Leave is but light .
Ferret , go bolt your Master ,
Here 's Gear will startle him .
I cannot keep
The Passion in me , I am e 'en turn 'd Child ,
And I must weep.
Fly , take away mine Host ,
My Beard , and Cap here , from me , and fetch my Lord .
I am her Father , Sir , and you shall now
Ask my Consent , before you have her .
Wife !
My dear and loving Wife ! my honour 'd Wife !
Who here hath gain 'd but I ?
I am Lord Frampul ,
The cause of all this trouble ?
I am he
Have measur 'd al the Shires of England over :
Wales , and her Mountains , seen those wilder Nations ,
Of People in the Peak , and Lancashire ;
Their Pipers , Fidlers , Rushers , Puppet-masters ,
Juglers and Gypsies , all the sorts of Canters ,
And Colonies of Beggars , Tumblers , Ape carriers ;
For to these Savages I was addicted ,
To search their Natures , and make odd Discoveries !
And here my Wife , like a she-Mandevile ,
Ventred in disquisition after me .
I may look up , admire , I cannot speak
Yet to my Lord .
Take heart , and breath , recover ,
Thou hast recover 'd me , who here had coffin 'd
My self alive , in a poor Hostelry ,
In penance of my wrongs done unto thee ,
Whom I long since gave lost .
So did I you ,
Till stealing mine own Daughter from her Sister ,
I lighted on this Error hath cur 'd all .
And in that cure , include my trespass , Mother ,
And Father , for my Wife ? ? ?
No, the Star-Chamber .
Away with that , you sour the sweetest Lettice
Was ever tasted .
Gi' you Joy , my Son ,
Cast her not off again .
O call me Father ,
Lovel , and this your Mother , if you like :
But take your Mistress , first , my Child : I have power
To give her now , with her consent , her Sister
Is given already to your Brother Beaufort .
Is this a Dream now , after my first Sleep ?
Or are these phant 'sies made i' the light Heart ?
And sold i' the New Inn ?
Best go to bed ,
And dream it over all .
Let 's all go sleep ,
Each with his Turtle .
Fly , provide us Lodgings .
Get Beds prepar 'd : yo ' are Master now o ' the Inn ,
The Lord o'the light Heart , I give it you .
Fly was my Fellow-Gypsey .
All my Family ,
Indeed , were Gypseys , Tapsters , Ostlers , Chamberlains ,
Reduced Vessels of Civility .
But here stands Pru , neglected , best deserving
Of all that are i' the House , or i' my Heart ,
Whom though I cannot help to a fit Husband ,
I 'll help to that will bring one , a just Portion :
I have two thousand pound in bank for Pru ,
Call for it when she will .
And I as much .
There 's somewhat yet , four thousand pound !
that 's better ,
Then sounds the Proverb , Four bare legs in a bed .
Me , and her Mistress , she hath power to coyn
Up into what she will .
Indefinite Pru .
But I must do the crowning act of Bounty !
What 's that , my Lord ?
Give her my self , which here
By all the holy Vows of Love I do .
Spare all your promis 'd Portions ; she is a Dowry
So all-sufficient in her Vertue and Manners ,
That Fortune cannot add to her .
My Lord ,
Your Praises are Instructions to mine Ears ,
Whence you have made your Wife to live your Servant .
Lights : get us several Lights .
Stay , let my Mistress
But hear my Vision sung , my Dream of Beauty ,
VVhich I have brought , prepar 'd , to bid us Joy ,
And light us all to bed , 'twill be instead
Of airing of the Sheets with a sweet Odour .
' Twill be an Incense to our Sacrifice
Of Love to night , where I will woo afresh ,
And like Mec?nas , having but one VVife ,
I 'll marry her every hour of life hereafter .
