Brain-worm ,
Call up your young master : bid him rise , Sir .
Tell him , I have some business to employ him .
I will , Sir , presently .
But hear you , sirah ,
If he be at his Book , disturb him not .
Well Sir .
How happy , yet , should I esteem my self ,
Could I ( by any practice ) wean the boy
From one vain course of study , he affects .
He is a Schollar , if a Man may trust
The liberal voice of Fame , in her report ,
Of good acompt in both our Universities ,
Either of which hath favour 'd him with Graces :
But their Indulgence must not spring in me
A fond opinion , that he cannot Err .
My self was once a Student , and , indeed ,
Fed with the self-same humour he is now ,
Dreaming on nought but idle Poetry ,
That fruitless , and unprofitable Art ,
Good unto none , but least to the Professors ,
Which , then , I thought the mistress of all knowledg :
But since , Time and the Truth have wak 'd my Judgment ,
And Reason taught me better to distinguish
The vain from th ' useful Learnings .
Cousin Stephen !
What news with you , that you are here so early ?
Nothing , but e 'en come to see how you do , Uncle
That 's kindly done , you are welcom , Couz .
I , I know that Sir , I would not ha' come else .
How does my Cousin Edward , Uncle ?
O , well Couz , go in and see : I doubt he be
scarce stirring yet .
Uncle , afore I go in , can you tell me , an' he
have e 're a Book of the Sciences of Hawking and Hunt -
ing ?
I would fain borrow it .
Why , I hope you will not a hawking now , will
you ?
No, wusse , but I 'll practice against next year Un-
cle : I have bought me a Hawk , and a Hood , and Bells ,
and all ; I lack nothing but a Book to keep it by .
O , most ridiculous .
Nay , look you now , you are angry , Uncle : why
you know an' a Man have not skill in the hawking and
hunting Languages now adays , I 'll not give a rush for
They are more studied than the Greek , or the La -
He is for no gallants Company without 'em .
And
by gads lid I scorn it , I , so I do , to be a Consort for eve-
ry Hum-drum , hang 'em Scroyles , there 's nothing in 'em
i' the World .
What do you talk on it ?
Because I dwell
at Hogsden , I shall keep Company with none but the Ar-
chers of Finsbury , or the Citizens that come a ducking to
Islington Ponds ?
A fine jest i' faith ! Slid a Gentleman
mun show himself like a Gentleman .
Uncle , I pray you
be not angry , I know what I have to do , I trow , I am
no Novice .
You are a prodigal absurd Cockscomb , Go to .
Nay , never look at me , it 's I that speak .
Tak't as you will Sir , I 'll not flatter you .
Ha' you not yet found means enow to waste
That which your Friends have left you , but you must
Go cast away your Money on a Kite ,
And know not how to keep it , when you ha' done ?
O it 's comly ! this will make you a Gentleman !
Well Cousin , well ! I see you are e 'ne past hope
Of all reclaim .
I , so , now you are told on it ,
You look another way .
What would you ha' me do ?
What would I have you do ?
I 'll tell you Kinsman ,
Learn to be Wise , and practice how to Thrive ,
That would I have you do : and not to spend
Your Coin on every Bable that you phansie ,
Or every foolish Brain that humours you .
I would not have you to invade each Place ,
Nor thrust your self on all Societies ,
Till Mens Affections , or your own Desert ,
Should worthily invite you to your Rank .
He that is so respectless in his Courses ,
B Oft
Oft sells his Reputation at cheap Market .
Nor would I , you should melt away your self
In flashing bravery , left while you affect
To make a blaze of Gentry to the World ,
A little puff of scorn extinguish it ,
And you be left like an unsav'ry Snuff ,
Whose Property is only to offend .
I 'd ha' you sober , and contain your self ;
Not that your Sail be bigger than your Boat :
But moderate your Expences now ( at first )
As you may keep the same proportion still .
Nor stand so much on your Gentility ,
Which is an Airy , and meer borrow 'd thing ,
From dead Mens Dust , and Bones : and none of yours ,
Except you make , or hold it .
Who comes here ?
Nay , we do not stand much on our Gentility ,
Friend ; yet you are welcom , and I assure you mine
Uncle here is a Man of a thousand a year , Middlesex
Land : he has but one Son in all the World , I am his
next Heir ( at the Common Law ) Master Stephen , as
simple as I stand here , if my Cousin dye ( as there 's hope
he will . )
I have a pretty living o ' mine own too , beside ,
hard by here .
In good time , Sir .
In good time , Sir ?
why ! and in very good time ,
Sir . You do not flout , friend , do you ?
Not I , Sir .
Not you , Sir ?
you were not best , Sir ; an' you
should , here be them can perceive it , and that quickly
too : go to .
And they can give it again soundly too ,
an' need be .
Why , Sir , let this satisfie you : good faith , I had
no such intent .
Sir , an' I thought you had , I would talk with
you , and that presently .
Good Master Stephen , so you may , Sir , at your
And so I would , Sir , good saucy Compani-
on ! an' you were out o ' mine Uncles Ground , I can tell
you ; though I do not stand upon my Gentility neither
Cousin ! Cousin ! will this ne 'er be left ?
Whorson base Fellow ! a Mechanical Serving-
man ! By this Cudgel , and 'twere not for shame ; I
would ? ? ?
What would you do , you peremptory Gull ?
If you cannot be quiet , get you hence .
You see , the honest Man demeans himself
Modestly to 'ards you , giving no reply
To your unseason 'd , quarrelling , rude fashion :
And still you huff it , with a kind of Carriage
As void of Wit , as of Humanity .
I pray , Sir , Is this Master Kno'well 's House ?
Yes marry is it , Sir .
I should enquire for a Gentleman , here , one Ma -
ster Edward Kno'well : do you know any such , Sir , I
pray you ?
I should forget my self else , Sir .
Are you the Gentleman ?
cry you mercy Sir : I
was requir 'd by a Gentleman i' the City , as I rode out at
this end o ' the Town , to deliver you this Letter , Sir .
To me , Sir ! What do you mean ?
pray you re -
member your Court 'sie .
( To his most selected Friend Master
Edward Kno'well . )
What might the Gentlemans Name
be , Sir , that sent it ?
nay , pray you be cover 'd .
One Master Well-bred , Sir .
Master Well bred ! A young Gentleman ?
is he not ?
The same Sir , Master Kitely married his Sister :
the rich Merchant i' the Old Jewry .
You say very true .
Make this honest Friend drink here : pray you go
This Letter is directed to my Son :
Yet I am Edward Kno'well too , and may
With the safe Conscience of good Manners , use
The Fellows Error to my satisfaction .
Well , I will break it ope ( old Men are curious )
Be it but for the Stiles sake , and the Phrase ,
To see if both do answer my Sons Praises ,
Who is almost grown the Idolater
Of this young Well-bred : what have we here ?
what 's this ?
The LETTER
WHy , Ned , I beseech thee , hast thou forsworn all thy
Friends i' the Old Jewry ?
or dost thou think us
all Jews that inhabit there ?
Yet if thou dost , come over , and
but see our frippery : change an old Shirt for a whole Smock
with us .
Do not conceive that Antipathy between us and
Hogsden , as was between Jews and Hogs-flesh .
Leave
thy vigilant Father alone , to number over his green Apricots ,
Evening and Morning , o ' the North west Wall : An' I had been
his Son , I had sav 'd him the labour long since , if taking in
all the young Wenches that pass by at the back-door , and cod-
ling every Kernel of the Fruit for 'em , would ha' serv 'd .
But
pr'y thee come over to me quickly , this morning ; I have such a
present for thee ( our Turky Company never sent the like to
the Grand-Signior . )
One is a Rimer , Sir , o ' your own batch ,
your own leven ; but doth think himself Poet-major o ' the
Town : willing to be shown , and worthy to be seen .
The other ? ?
I will not venter his Description with you , till you come , because
I would ha' you make hither with an Appetite .
If the worst of
'em be not worth your Journey , draw your Bill of Charges , as
unconscionable as any Guild-hall Verdict will give it you , and
you shall be allow 'd your Viaticum .
From the Wind-mill .
From the Burdello , it might come as well ,
The Spittle , or Pict-hatch .
Is this the Man
My Son hath sung so , for the happiest Wit ,
The choicest Brain , the Times have sent us forth ?
I know not what he may be in the Arts ,
Nor what in Schools : but surely , for his Manners ,
I judge him a prophane and dissolute wretch :
Worse by possession of such great good gifts ,
Being the Master of so loose a Spirit .
Why , what unhallow 'd Ruffian would have writ
In such a scurrilous manner , to a Friend !
Why should he think , I tell my Apricots ,
Or play th ' Hesperian Dragon with my Fruit ,
To watch it ?
Well , my Son , I had thought
Y' had had more Judgment t ' have made Election
Of your Companions , than t ' have tane on trust
Such petulant , jeering Gamesters , that can spare
No Argument , or Subject from their Jest .
But I perceive Affection makes a Fool
Of any Man , too much the Father .
Is the Fellow gone that brought this Letter ?
Yes , Sir , a pretty while since .
And where 's your young Master ?
In his Chamber , Sir .
He spake not with the Fellow ! did he ?
No, Sir , he saw him not .
Take you this Letter , and deliver it my Son ;
But with no notice , that I have open 'd it , on your life .
O Lord , Sir , that were a Jest indeed !
I am resolv 'd I will not stop his journey ,
Nor practise any violent means to stay .
The
The unbridled course of youth in him : for that ,
Restrain 'd , grows more impatient ; and , in kind ,
Like to the eager , but the generous Grey-hound ,
Who ne 'r so little from his game with-held ,
Turns head , and leaps up at his holders throat .
There is a way of winning , more by love ,
And urging of the modesty , than fear :
Force works on servile natures , not the free .
He that 's compell 'd to goodness , may be good ;
But 'tis but for that fit : where others drawn
By softness , and example , get a habit .
Then , if they stray , but warn 'em : and the same
They should for vertu' have done , they 'll do for shame .
Yes , o ' my word Sir , and read the Con-
That scarce contents me .
What countenance
( pr'y thee ) made he , i' the reading of it ?
was he an-
gry , or pleas 'd ?
Nay Sir , I saw him not read it , nor open it , I
assure your worship .
No ?
how know 'st thou , then , that he did ei-
ther ?
Marry , Sir , because he charg 'd me , on my
life , to tell no body , that he open 'd it ; which , unless
he had done , he would never fear to have it re -
That 's true : well I thank thee , Brayn-worm .
O , Brayn-worm , did 'st thou not see a fellow
here in a what 'sha'-call-him Doublet ?
he brought mine
Uncle a Letter e 'en now .
Yes , Master Stephen , what of him ?
O , I ha' such a mind to beat him ? ?
Where is
he ?
canst thou tell ?
Faith , he is not of that mind : he is gone , Ma -
ger Stephen .
Gone ! which way ?
when went he ?
how long
since ?
He is rid hence : he took Horse at the street -
And I staid i' the Fields ! horson scander-bag
Rogue ! ? that I had but a Horse to fetch him back
Why , you may ha' my Mrs. Gelding , to save
your longing , Sir .
But , I ha' no Boots , that 's the spight on't .
Why , a fine wisp of Hay , rould hard , Master
No faith , it 's no boot to follow him , now : let
him e 'ne go , and hang .
Pr'y thee , help to truss me , a
He do 's so vex me ? ? ?
You 'll be worse vex 'd , when you are truss 'd ,
Master Stephen .
Best , keep un-brac 'd ; and walk your
self , till you be cold : your Choller may founder you
By my faith , and so I will , now thou tell 'st me
on't : How dost thou like my Leg , Brayn-worm ?
A very good Leg , Master Stephen ; but the
woollen Stocking do 's not commend it so well .
Foh , the Stockings be good enough , now Sum -
mer is coming on , for the dust : I 'll have a pair of
Silk again ' Winter , that I go to dwell i'the Town .
Ithink my Leg would shew in a Silk-hose ? ?
Believe me , Master Stephen , rarely well .
In sadness , I think it would : I have a reasonable
good Leg .
You have an excellent good Leg , Master Ste-
phen ; but I cannot stay , to praise it longer now , and I
am very sorry for't .
Another time will serve , Brayn-worm .
Gra -
mercy for this .
Ha , ha , ha .
' Slid , I hope , he laughs not at me , and he do ?
Here was a Letter , indeed , to be intercepted by
a Man 's Father , and do him good with him ! He can-
not but think most vertuously , both of me , and the Sender ,
sure ; that make the careful Costar'-monger of him in
our familiar Epistles .
Well , if he read this with patience ,
I 'll be gelt , and troll Ballads for Mr. John Trundle , yon -
der , the rest of my mortality .
It is true , and likely , my
Father may have as much patience as another Man ;
for he takes much Physick : and oft taking Physick
makes a Man very patient .
But would your Packet ,
Master Well-bred , had arriv 'd at him , in such a minute
of his patience ; then he had known the end of it ,
which now is doubtful , and threatens ?
What ! my wise
Cousin ! Nay , then I 'll furnish our Feast with one Gull
more to 'ard the mess .
He writes to me of a Brace , and
here 's One , that 's Three : O , for a fourth ! Fortune , if
ever thou'lt use thine Eyes , I intreat thee ? ? ?
O , now I see , who he laught at .
He laught at
some body in that Letter .
By this good light , an' he
had laught at me ? ? ?
How now , Cousin Stephen , melancholy ?
Yes , a little .
I thought you had laught at me ,
Why , what an' I had , Couz ?
what would you
ha' done ?
By this light , I would ha' told mine Uncle .
Nay , if you would ha' told your Uncle , I did
laugh at you , Couz .
Did you , indeed ?
Yes , indeed .
Why , then ? ? ?
What then ?
I am satisfied , it is sufficient .
Why , be so , gentle Couz .
And I pray you
let me intreat a courtesie of you .
I am sent for , this
Morning , by a Friend i' the Old Jewry , to come to him ;
It 's but crossing over the Fields to Moor gate : Will you
bear me company ?
I protest , it is not to draw you in-
to Bond , or any Plot against the State , Couz .
Sir , that 's all one , and 'twere ; you shall com-
mand me twice so far as Moor-gate , to do you good
in such a matter .
Do you think I would leave you ?
Iprotest ? ? ?
No, no , you shall not protest , Couz ?
By my fackings , but I will , by your leave ;
I 'll protest more to my Friend , than I 'll speak off , at
this time .
You speak very well , Couz .
Nay , not so neither , you shall pardon me : but
I speak to serve my turn .
Your turn , Couz ?
Do you know what you
say ?
A gentleman of your sort , parts , carriage , and esti-
mation , to talk o ' your turn i' this company , and to me
alone , like a Tankard-bearer at a Conduit ! fie .
A Wight ,
that ( hitherto ) his every step hath left the stamp of a
great Foot behind him , as every word the savour of a
strong spirit ! and he ! this man ! so grac 'd , guilded , or
( to use a more fit Metaphor ) so tin-foild by nature , as not
ten House-wives Pewter ( again' a good time ) shews more
bright to the World than he ! and he ( as I said last , so
I say again , and still shall say it ) this Man ! to conceal
such real Ornaments as these , and shaddow their glory ,
as a Milleners Wife do 's her wrought Stomacher , with
a smoky Lawn , or a black Cypress ?
O Couz ! it can-
not be answer 'd , go not about it .
Drake 's old Ship
at Deptford may sooner circle the World again .
Come ,
wrong not the quality of your desert , with looking
downward , Couz ; but hold up your Head , so : and
let the Idea of what you are , be portray 'd i' your Face ,
B2 that
that Men may read i' your Physnomy , ( Here , within
this place is to be seen the true , rare , and accomplish 'd Mon -
ster , or miracle of Nature , which is all one . )
What
think you of this , Couz ?
Why , I do think of it ; and I will be more Proud ,
and Melancholy , and Gentleman-like , than I have been ;
I 'll ensure you .
Why , that 's resolute Master Stephen ! Now , if
I can but hold him up to his height , as it is happily begun ,
it will do well for a Suburb humour : we may hap have
a match with the City , and play him for Forty pound .
Come , Couz .
I 'll follow you .
Follow me ?
you must go before .
Nay , an' I must , I will .
Pray you , shew me ,
good Cousin .
Who 's there ?
O , Master Matthew ! gi' your
Worship good morrow .
What ! Cob ! how dost thou , good Cob ?
dost thou
inhabit here , Cob ?
I sir , I and my Linage ha' kept a poor House ,
here , in our days .
Thy Linage , Monsieur Cob , what Linage , what
Linage ?
Why Sir , an ancient Linage , and a princely .
Mine ance 'try came from a Kings belly , no worse Man :
and yet no Man neither ( by your Worships leave , I did
lie in that ) but Herring the King of Fish ( from his belly ,
I proceed ) one o ' the Monarchs o ' the World , I assure you .
The first Red Herring that was broild in Adam and Eve 's
Kitchin , do I fetch my Pedigree from , by the Harrots
His Cob , was my great-great-mighty-great
Why mighty ?
why mighty ?
I pray thee .
O , it was a mighty while ago , Sir , and a mighty
great Cob .
How know 'st thou that ?
How know I ?
why , I smell his Ghost , ever and
Smell a Ghost ?
? unsavoury jest ! and the Ghost of
a Herring , Cob .
I Sir , with favour of your Worships Nose ,
Mr. Matthew , why not the Ghost of a Herring Cob , as well
as the Ghost of Rasher-bacon ?
Roger Bacon , thou wouldst say ?
I say Rasher-Bacon .
They were both broild o '
the Coles ; and a Man may smell broild Meat , I hope ?
you are a Scholar , upsolve me that , now .
O raw ignorance ! Cob , canst thou shew me of a
a Gentleman , one Captain Bobadill , where his Lodging is ?
O , my guest , Sir ! you mean .
Thy guest ! Alas ! ha , ha .
Why do you laugh , Sir ?
Do you not mean Cap -
tain Bobadill ?
Cob , 'pray thee advise thy self well : do not wrong
the Gentleman , and thy self too .
I dare be sworn , he
scorns thy House : he ! He lodge in such a base obscure
place , as thy House ! Tut , I know his disposition so well ,
he would not lie in thy Bed , if tho'uldst gi't him .
I will not give it him , though , Sir . Mass , I
thought somewhat was in't , we could not get to Bed ,
all night ! Well Sir , though he lie not o ' my Bed , he lies
o ' my Bench : an't please you to go up , Sir , you shall
find him with two Cushions under his Head , and his
Cloke wrapt about him , as though he had neither won
nor lost , and yet ( I warrant ) he ne 'r cast better in hisl ife ,
than he has done to night .
Why ?
was he drunk ?
Drunk Sir , you hear not me say so .
Perhaps , he
swallow 'd a Tavern-token , or some such device , Sir : I
have nothing to do withal .
I deal with Water , and not
with Wine .
Gi' me my Tankard there , hough , God b'
w ' you , Sir . It 's six a Clock : I should ha' carried two
Turns , by this .
What hough ?
my stopple , come .
Lie in a Water-bearers House ! A Gentleman of
his havings ! Well , I 'll tell him my mind .
What Tib , shew this Gentleman up to the Captain .
Oh , an' my House were the Brazen-head now ! faith it
would e 'en speak , Mo fools yet .
You should ha' some now
would take this M.
Matthew to be a Gentleman , at the
His Father 's an honest Man , a worshipful Fish -
monger , and so forth ; and now do 's he creep , and wrig-
gle into acquaintance with all the brave Gallants about
the Town , such as my guest is : ( ? , my guest is a fine Man )
and they flout him invincibly .
He useth every day to a
Merchants House ( where I serve Water ) one Master
Kitely 's i' the Old Jewry ; and here 's the jest , he is in love
with my Master 's Sister , ( Mistris Bridget ) and calls her
Mistris : and there he will sit you a whole Afternoon
sometimes , reading o ' these same abominable , vile , ( a Pox
on 'em , I cannot abide them ) rascally Verses , Poyetry ,
Poyetry , and speaking of Enterludes , 'twill make a Man
burst to hear him .
And the Wenches , they do so geer ,
and ti-he at him ? ?
well , should they do so much to
me , I 'd forswear them all , by the Foot of Pharaoh .
There 's
an Oath ! How many Water-bearers shall you hear swear
such an Oath ?
? , I have a guest ( he teaches me ) he do 's
swear the legiblest of any Man christned : By St .
George ,
the Foot of Pharaoh , the Body of me , as I am a Gentle -
man , and a Soldier : such dainty Oaths ! and withal , he
do 's take this same filthy roguish Tobacco , the finest , and
cleanliest ! it would do a Man good to see the fume come
forth at 's Tonnels ! Well , he owes me Forty Shillings ( my
Wife lent him out of her Purse , by six-pence a time ) be-
sides his Lodging : I would I had it .
I shall ha'it , he says ,

What say you , Sir ? lying
on his Bench .
A Cup o ' thy small Beer , sweet Hostess .
Sir , there 's a Gentleman , below , would speak
with you
A Gentleman ! 'ods so , I am not within .
My Husband told him you were , Sir .
What a Plague ? ?
what meant he ?
Captain Bobadill ?
Who 's there ?
( take away the Bason , good Ho-
stess ) come up , Sir .
He would desire you to come up , Sir . You come
into a cleanly House , here .
' Save you , Sir . ' Save you , Captain .
Gentle Master Matthew ! Is it you , Sir ?
Please
you to sit down ?
Thank you good Captain , you may see , I am
somewhat audacious .
No so , Sir . I was requested to Supper , last
Night , by a sort of Gallants , where you were wish 'd for ,
and drunk to , I assure you .
Vouchsafe me , by whom , good Captain ?
Marry , by young Well-bred , and others : Why ,
Hostess , a Stool here , for this Gentleman .
No haste , Sir , 'tis very well .
Body of me ! It was so late ere we parted last ,
Night , I can scarce open my Eyes , yet ; I was but new
risen , as you came : how passes the Day abroad , Sir ?
you can tell .
Faith , some half Hour to seven : Now trust
me , you have an exceeding fine Lodging here , very
neat , and private !
I Sir : sit down , I pray you .
Mr. Matthew ( in
any case ) possess no Gentlemen of our acquaintance ,
with notice of my Lodging .
Who ?
I Sir ?
Not that I need to care who know it , for the
Cabbin is convenient , but in regard I would not be
too popular , and generally visited , as some are .
True , Captain , I conceive you .
For , do you see , Sir , by the heart of valour in
me , ( except it be to some peculiar and choice spirits ,
to whom I am extraordinarily ingag 'd , as your self , or
so ) I could not extend thus far .
O Lord , Sir , I resolve so .
I confess , I love a cleanly and quiet privacy ,
above all the tumult , and roar of fortune .
What
new Book ha' you there ?
What ! Go by , Hieronymo!
I , did you ever see it acted ?
is't not well pend ?
Well pend ?
I would fain see all the Poets , of
these times , pen such another Play as that was ! they 'll
prate and swagger , and keep a stir of Art and De-
vices , when ( as I am a Gentleman ) read 'em , they
are the most shallow , pittiful , barren Fellows , that
live upon the face of the Earth , again !
Indeed , here are a number of fine Speeches in
this Book ! O Eyes , no Eyes , but Fountains fraught with
Tears ! There 's a conceit ! Fountains fraught with
Tears ! O life , no life , but lively form of death ! Another !
O World , no World , but mass of publick wrongs ! A third !
Confuss 'd and fill 'd with murder , and misdeeds ! A fourth !
O , the Muses ! Is't not excellent ?
Is't not simply the
best that ever you heard , Captain ?
Ha ?
How do you
like it ?
' Tis good .
To the , the purest object to my sense ,
The most refined Essence Heaven covers ,
Send I these Lines , wherein I do commence
The happy state of Turtle-billing Lovers .
If they prove rough , un-polish't , harsh , and rude ,
Haste make the waste .
Thus , mildly , I conclude .
Nay , proceed , proceed .
Where 's this ?
This , Sir ?
a Toy o ' mine own , in my nonage :
the infancy of my Muses ! But , when will you come
and see my Study ?
good faith , I can shew you some
very good things , I have done of late ? ?
That Boot
becomes your Leg , passing well , Captain , methinks !
So , so , It 's the fashion , Gentlemen now use ?
Troth , Captain , and now you speak o ' the Fa -
shion , Master Well-bred 's elder Brother , and I , are faln
out exceedingly : this other day , I hapned to enter
into some discourse of a Hanger , which I assure you ,
both for Fashion , and Work-man-ship , was most pe-
remptory-beautiful , and Gentleman-like ! Yet he con-
demn 'd , and cry 'd it down for the most pyed and
ridiculous that ever he saw .
Squire Down-right ?
the half-Brother , was't not ?
I Sir , he .
Hang him , rook , hee ! why he ha 's no more
judgment than a Malt-horse .
By S.
George , I wonder
youl 'd lose a thought upon such an animal : the most
peremptory absurd clown of Christendom , this day , he is
I protest to you , as I am a Gentleman and a
Soldier , I ne 'r chang 'd words , with his like .
By his dis -
course , he should eat nothing but Hay .
He was born
for the Manger , Pannier , or Pack-saddle ! He has not so
much as a good Phrase in his Belly , but all old Iron , and
rusty Proverbs ! a good Commodity for some Smith to
make Hob-nails of .
I , and he thinks to carry it away with his Man-
hood still , where he comes .
He brags he will gi' me the
bastinado , as I hear .
How ! He the bastinado ! how came he by that
word , trow ?
Nay , indeed , he said Cudgel me ; I term 'd it so ,
for my more grace .
That may be : for I was sure it was none of his
But , when ?
when said he so ?
Faith , yesterday , they say : a young Gallant , a
Friend of mine told me so .
By the Foot of Pharaoh , and 't were my case
now , I should send him a chartel presently .
The bastina -
do ! A most proper , and sufficient dependance , warranted
by the great Caranza .
Come hither .
You shall chartel him .
Ile shew you a trick or two , you shall kill him with , at
pleasure : the first stoccata , if you will , by this Air .
Indeed , you have absolute knowledge i' the my-
stery , I have heard , Sir .
Of whom ?
of whom ha' you heard it , I be-
seech you ?
Troth , I have heard it spoken of divers , that you
have very rare , and un-in-one-breath-utter-able skill , Sir .
By Heaven , no , not I ; no skill i' the Earth : some
small rudiments i' the Science , as to know my time , di-
stance , or so .
I have profest it more for Noblemen , and
Gentlemens use , than mine own practice , I assure you .
Hostess , accommodate us with another Bed-staff here ,
quickly : Lend us another Bed-staff .
The Woman does
let your poynard maintain your defence , thus : ( give
it the Gentleman , and leave us ) so , Sir . Come on : O ,
twine your body more about , that you may fall to a
more sweet , comly , gentleman-like guard , so indifferent .
Hollow your body more Sir , thus .
Now , stand fast o '
your left Leg , note your Distance , keep your due pro-
portion of Time ? ?
Oh , you disorder your point ,
most irregularly !
How is the bearing of it , now , Sir ?
O , out of measure ill ! A well experienc 'd hand
would pass upon you at pleasure .
How mean you , Sir , pass upon me ?
Why thus , Sir ( make a thrust at me ) come in
upon the answer , controul your Point , and make a full
carreer at the Body .
The Best-practis 'd Gallants of the
Time , name it the passada : a most desperate thrust , be-
lieve it !
Well , come , Sir .
Why , you do not manage your Weapon with a -
ny facility or grace to invite me ! I have no Spirit to play
with you .
Your dearth of Judgment renders you
But one venue , Sir .
Venue ! Fie .
Most gross denomination , as ever I
O , the stoccata , while you live , Sir . Note that .
Come , put on your Cloak , and we 'll go to some private
place , where you are acquainted , some Tavern , or so ?
and have a bit ? ?
I'le send for one of these Fencers , and
he shall breath you , by my direction ; and , then , I will
teach you your trick .
You shall kill him with it , at the
first , if you please .
Why , I will learn you by the true
judgment of the Eye , Hand , and Foot , to controul any
Enemies Point i' the World .
Should your Adversary con-
front you with a Pistol , 'twere nothing , by this hand ;
you should , by the same Rule , controul his Bullet , in a
Line ; except it were Hail-shot , and spred .
What Mo -
ney ha' you about you , Master Matthew ?
Faith , I ha' not past two Shillings , or so .
' Tis somewhat with the least : but come .
We
will have a bunch of Radish , and Salt , to taste our
Wine ; and a Pipe of Tabacco , to close the Orifice of the
Stomach : and then we 'll call upon young Wellbred .
Perhaps we shall meet the Coridon , his Brother there , and
put him to the question .
There lies a Note , within upon my Desk ,
Here take my Key : It is no matter , neither .
Where is the Boy ?
Within , Sir , i'th Ware-house ,
Let him tell over , straight , that Spanish Gold ,
And weigh it , with Pieces of Eight .
Do you
See the delivery of those Silver-stuffs ,
To Master Lucar .
Tell him , if he will ,
He shall ha' the Grograns , at the rate I told him ,
And I will meet him , on the Exchange anon .
Good , Sir .
Do you see that fellow Brother Down-right .
I , What of him ?
He is a Jewel , Brother .
I took him of a Child , up , at my Door ,
And Christened him , gave him mine own Name Thomas ,
Since bred him at the Hospital ; where proving
A toward Imp , I call 'd him home , and taught him
So much , as I have made him my Cashier ,
And giv'n him , who had none , a Surname , Cash :
And find him , in his Place so full of faith ,
That , I durst trust my Life into his hands !
So would not I in any Bastards , Brother ,
As , it is like , he is : although I knew
My self his Father .
But you said yo ' had somewhat
To tell me , gentle Brother , what is't ?
what is't ?
Faith , I am very loath , to utter it ,
As fearing , it may hurt your patience :
But that I know you Judgment is of strength ,
Against the nearness of affection ? ?
What need this Circumstance ?
pray you be
I will not say , how much I do ascribe
Unto your Friendship ; nor , in what regard
I hold your love : but , let my past behaviour ,
And usage of your Sister , but confirm
How well I'ave been affected to your ? ? ?
You are too tedious , come to the matter , the
Then ( without further Ceremony ) thus .
My Brother Well-bred , Sir , ( I know not how )
Of late , is much declin 'd in what he was ,
And greatly alter 'd in his disposition .
When he came first to lodge here in my House ,
Ne 're trust me , if I were not proud of him :
Me thought he bare himself in such a fashion ,
So full of Man , and sweetness in his Carriage ,
And ( what was chief ) it shew 'd not borrowed in him ,
But all , he did , became him as his own ,
And seem 'd as perfect , proper , and possest
As Breath with Life ; or Colour , with the Blood .
But , now , his course is so irregular ,
So loose , affected , and depriv 'd of grace ,
And he himself withal so far faln off
From that first place , as scarce no Note remains ,
To tell Mens Judgments where he lately stood .
He 's grown a stranger to all due respect ,
Forgetful of his Friends , and not content
To stale himself in all Societies ,
He makes my House here common , as a Mart ,
A Theater , a publick Receptacle
For giddy Humour , and diseased Riot ;
And here ( as in a Tavern , or a Stews )
He , and his wild Associates , spend their Hours ,
In repetition of lascivious Jeasts ,
Swear , leap , drink , dance , and revel night by night ,
Controul my Servants : and indeed what not ?
'Sdeyns , I know not what I should say to him , i'
the whole World ! He values me at a crakt Three-Far-
things , for ought I see : It will never out of the Flesh
that 's bred i' the Bone ! I have told him enough , one
would think , if that would serve : But , Counsel to him ,
is as good , as a Shoulder of Mutton to a sick Horse .
Well !
he knows what to trust to , for George .
Let him spend ,
and spend , and domineer , till his Heart ake ; an' he
think to be reliev 'd by me , when he is got into one o '
your City-pounds , the Counters , he has the wrong Sow
by the Ear i' faith : and claps his Dish at the wrong
mans Door .
I 'll lay my hand o ' my Half-peny , e 're I
part with't , to fetch him out , I 'll assure him .
Nay , good Brother , let it not trouble you , this .
S 'death , he mads me , I could eat my very Spur-
leathers , for anger ! But , why are you so tame ?
Why
do not you speak to him , and tell him how he disquiets
your House ?
O , There are divers reasons to disswade , Brother ,
But , would your self vouchsafe to travel in it ,
( Though but with plain and easie Circumstance , )
It would both come much better to his sense ,
And favour less of stomach , or of passion .
You are his elder Brother , and that Title
Both gives , and warrants your Authority ,
Which ( by your presence seconded ) must breed
A kind of duty in him , and regard :
Whereas , if I should intimate the least ,
It would but add contempt , to his neglect ,
Heap worse on ill , make up a Pile of hatred
That , in the rearing , would come tottring down
And , in the ruine , bury all our love .
Nay , more than this , Brother , if I should speak ,
He would be ready from his heat of humour ,
And over flowing of the Vapour , in him ,
To blow the Ears of his familiars ,
With the false breath , of telling , what disgraces ,
And low disparagements , I had put upon him .
Whilst they , Sir , to relieve him , in the Fable ,
Make their loose Comments upon every Word ,
Gesture , or Look , I use ; mock me all over ,
From my flat Cap unto my shining Shooes :
And , out of their impetuous rioting Phant 'sies ;
Beget some slander , that shall dwell with me .
And what would that be think you ?
marry , this
They would give out ( because my Wife is fair ,
My self but lately married , and my Sister
Here sorjourning a Virgin in my House )
That I were jealous ! nay , as sure as death ,
That they would say .
And how that I had quarrell 'd ,
My Brother purposely , thereby to find
An apt Pretext , to banish them my House .
Mass , perhaps so : They 're like enough to do it .
Brother , they would , believe it : so should I
( Like one of these penurious Quack-salvers )
But set the Bills up to mine own disgrace .
And try Experiments upon my self :
Lend Scorn and Envy opportunity ,
To stab my Reputation , and good Name ? ?
Speak to him ?
away , by the foot of Pharaoh ,
you shall not , you shall not do him that grace .
The
time of day , to you , Gentleman o ' the House .
Is Mr. Well -
bred stirring ?
How then ?
what should he do ?
Gentleman of the House , it is to you : is he with -
in , Sir ?
He came not to his Lodging to night , Sir , I as-
sure you .
Why , do you hear ?
The Gentleman-Citizen hast satisfied me , I 'll
talk to no Scavenger .
How , Scavenger ?
stay Sir , stay .
Nay , Brother Down-right .
' Heart ! stand you away , and you love me .
You shall not follow him now , I pray you , Brother ,
Good faith you shall not : I will over-rule you .
Ha ?
Scavenger ?
well , go to , I say little : but , by
this good day , ( God forgive me I should swear ) if I put
it up so , say , I am the rankest Cow that ever pist .
'Sdeyns , and I swallow this , I 'll ne 're draw my Sword
in the light of Fleet-street again , while I live ; I 'll sit in
a Barn , with Madge-howlet , and catch Mice first .
Sca -
venger ?
' Heart , and I 'll go near to fill that huge Tum -
brel-slop of yours , with somewhat , and I have good luck :
your Garagantua breech cannot carry it away so .
Oh do not fret your self thus , never think on't .
These are my Brothers Consorts , these ! these
are his Cam 'rades , his walking Mates ! he 's a Gallant , a
Cavaliero too , right Hang-man cut ! Let me not live ,
and I could not find in my heart to swinge the whole
gang of 'em , one after another , and begin with him first .
I am griev 'd , it should be said he is my Brother , and
take these Courses .
Well , as he brews , so shall he drink ,
for George , again .
Yet he shall hear on't , and that tight-
ly too , and I live , i' faith .
But , Brother , let your reprehension ( then )
Run in an easie current , not ore-high
Carried with rashness , or devouring choler ;
But rather use the soft perswading way ,
Whose Powers will work more gently , and compose
Th' imperfect Thoughts you labour to reclaim :
More winning , than enforcing the consent .
I , I , let me alone for that , I warrant you .
How now ?
oh , the Bell rings to Breakfast .
Brother , I pray you go in , and bear my Wife
Company , till I come ; I 'll but give order
For some dispatch of business to my Servants ? ?
our Maids will have you by the back
( i' faith )
For coming so late this Morning .
Perhaps so , Sir , take heed some body have not
them by the Belly , for walking so late in the Evening .
Well , yet my troubled spirit 's somewhat eas 'd ,
Though not repos 'd in that security
As I could wish : But I must be content .
How e 're I set a face on't to the World
Would I had lost this Finger , at a venture ,
So Well-bred had ne 're lodg 'd within my House .
Why 't cannot be , where there is such resort
Of wanton Gallants , and young Revellers ,
That any Woman should be honest long .
Is't like that factious Beauty will preserve
The publick weal of Chastity unshaken ,
When such strong motives muster , and make head
Against her single peace ?
No, no .
Beware
When mutual appetite doth meet to treat ,
And Spirits of one kind and quality
Come once to parlee in the Pride of Blood ,
It is no slow Conspiracy that follows .
Well ( to be plain ) if I but thought the time
Had answer 'd their affections , all the World
Should not perswade me , but I were a Cuckcold .
Marry , I hope , they ha' not got that start :
For opportunity hath baulkt 'em yet ,
And shall do still , while I have Eyes , and Ears
To attend the impositions of my heart .
My presence shall be as an Iron Bar ,
' Twixt the conspiring motions of desire :
Yea , every look , or glance mine eyes ejects ,
Shall check occasion , as one doth his Slave ,
When he forgets the limits of prescription .
Sister Bridget , pray you fetch down the Rose -
water above in the Closet .
Sweet-heart , will you come
in to Break-fast ?
An' she have over-heard me now ?
I pray thee ( good Muss ) we stay for you .
By Heaven I would not for a thousand Angels .
What aile you , Sweet-heart ?
are you not well ?
speak good Muss .
Troth my head akes extreamly , on a sudden .
Oh , the Lord !
How now ?
what ?
Alas , how it burns ?
Muss , keep you warm ,
good truth it is this new Disease , there 's a number are
troubled withal ! for Loves sake sweet-heart , come in , out
of the Air .
How simple , and how subtil are her Answers ?
A new Disease , and many troubled with it !
Why true : she heard me , all the world to nothing .
I pray thee , good Sweet-heart , come in ; the
Air will do you harm , in troth .
The Air ! she has me i' the Wind ! Sweet-heart ,
I 'll come to you presently : 'twill away , I hope .
Pray heaven it do .
A new Disease ! I know not , new , or old ,
But it may well be call 'd poor mortals plague :
For , like a pestilence , it doth infect
The Houses of the Brain .
First , it begins
Solely to work upon the Phantasie ,
Filling her seat with such pestiferous Air ,
As soon corrupts the Judgment ; and from thence ,
Sends like contagion to the Memory :
Still each to other giving the infection .
Which as a subtil Vapour spreads it self
Confusedly , through every sensive Part ,
Till not a thought or motion in the mind
Be free from the black poyson of suspect .
Ah , but what misery is it , to know this ?
Or , knowing it , to want the Minds Erection
In such Extremes ?
Well , I will once more strive
( In spite of this black Cloud ) my self to be ,
And shake the Fever off , that thus shakes me .
ted thus , from a poor Creature to a Creator ; for
now must I create an intolerable sort of Lies , or my
present Profession loses the Grace : And yet the Lie to
a Man of my Coat , is as ominous a Fruit , as the Fico .
OSir , it holds for good Polity ever , to have that outward -
ly in vilest estimation , that inwardly is most dear to us .
So much for my borrowed Shape .
Well , the troth is ,
my old Master intends to follow my young , dry-foot ,
over Moor-fields , to London , this morning : now I , know -
ing of this Hunting-match , or rather Conspiracy , and
to insinuate with my young Master , ( for so must we
that are Blue-waiters , and Men of Hope and Service
do , or perhaps we may wear Motley at the Years end ,
and who wears Motley , you know ) have got me afore ,
in this Disguise , determining here to lie in Ambuscado ,
and intercept him in the mid-way .
If I can but get his
Cloke , his Purse , his Hat , nay , any thing , to cut him off ,
that is , to stay his Journy , Veni , vidi , vici , I may say
with Captain C?sar , I am made for ever , i' faith .
Well ,
now must I practise to get the true Garb of one of
these Lance-Knights , my Arm here , and my ?
young
Master ! and his Cousin , Mr. Stephen , as I am true
counterfeit Man of War , and no Soldier !
So Sir ; and how then Couz ?
'Sfoot , I have lost my Purse , I think .
How ?
lost your Purse ?
where ?
when had
you it ?
I cannot tell , stay .
' Slid , I am afeard they will know me ; would I
could get by them .
What ?
ha' you it ?
No, I think I was bewitcht , I ? ?
Nay , do not weep the Loss , hang it , let it go .
Oh , it 's here : no , and it had been lost , I had not
car 'd , but for a Jet Ring Mrs. Mary sent me .
A jet Ring ?
O the Poesie , the Poesie ?
Fine , i' faith ! Though Fancy sleep , my Love is deep .
Meaning , that tho ' I did not fansie her , yet she loved me
Most excellent !
And then I sent her another , and my Poesie was ,
The deeper the sweeter , I 'll be judg 'd by St .
How , by St .
Peter ?
I do not conceive that .
Marry , St .
Peter , to make up the Meter .
Well , there the Saint was your good Patron ,
he help't you at your need ; thank him , thank him .
I cannot take leave on 'em so ; I
will venture , come what will .
Gentlemen ,
please you change a few Crowns for a ve-
ry excellent good Blade here ?
I am a poor
Gentleman , a Soldier , one that ( in the better state of my
Fortunes ) scorn 'd so mean a Refuge ; but now it is the
Humour of Necessity to have it so .
You seem to be
Gentlemen well affected to Martial Men , else should I
rather die with silence , than live with shame .
However
vouchsafe to remember , it is my Want speaks , not my
This Condition agrees not with my Spirit ? ?
Where hast thou serv 'd ?
May it please you , Sir , in all the late Wars of
Bohemia , Hungaria , Dalmatia , Poland , where not , Sir ?
Ihave been a poor Servitor by Sea and Land , any time
this fourteen Years , and follow 'd the Fortunes of the
best Commanders in Christendom .
I was twice shot at
the taking of Aleppo , once at the Relief of Vienna ; I
have been at Marseilles , Naples , and the Adriatick Gulf , a
Gentleman-Slave in the Gallies thrice , where I was most
dangerously shot in the Head , through both the Thighs ,
and yet being thus maim 'd , I am void of Maintenance ,
nothing left me but my Scars , the noted Marks of my
How will you sell this Rapier , Friend ?
Generous Sir , I refer it to your own Judgment ;
you are Gentleman , give me what you please .
True , I am a Gentleman , I know that , Friend :
But what though ?
I pray you say , what would you ask ?
I assure you , the Blade may become the Side or
Thigh of the best Prince in Europe .
I , with a Velvet Scabbard , I think .
Nay , an't be mine , it shall have a Velvet Scab -
bard , Couz , that 's flat : I 'd not wear it as 'tis , and you
would give me an Angel .
At your Worships pleasure , Sir ; nay , 'tis a most
pure Toledo .
I had rather it were a Spaniard .
But tell me ,
what shall I give you for it ?
An' it had a Silver Hilt ? ?
Come , come , you shall not buy it ; hold , there 's
a Shilling , Fellow , take thy Rapier .
Why , but I will buy it now , because you say so ;
and there 's another Shilling , Fellow , I scorn to be out -
What , shall I walk with a Cudgel , like Higgin-
bottom , and may have a Rapier for Money ?
You may buy one in the City .
Tut , I 'll buy this i' the Field , so I will ; I have a
mind to't , because 'tis a Field Rapier .
Tell me your
lowest Price .
You shall not buy it , I say .
By this Money , but I will , though I give more
than 'tis worth .
Come away , you are a Fool .
Friend , I am a Fool , that 's granted ; but I 'll have
it , for that Words sake .
Follow me for your Money .
At your service , Sir .
Sent to my Son , nor leave t 'admire the Change
Of Manners , and the Breeding of our Youth
Within the Kingdom , since my self was one .
When I was young , he liv 'd not in the Stews
Durst have conceiv 'd a Scorn , and utter 'd it ,
On a grey Head ; Age was Authority
Against a Buffoon , and a Man had then
A certain Reverence paid unto his Years ,
That had none due unto his Life .
So much
The Sanctity of some prevail 'd , for others .
But now we all are fall 'n ; Youth , from their Fear ;
And Age , from that which bred it , Good Example .
Nay , would our selves were not the first , even Parents ,
That did destroy the Hopes in our own Children ,
Or they not learn 'd our Vices in their Cradles ,
And suck 'd in our ill Customs with their Milk .
E're all their Teeth be born , or they can speak ,
We make their Palats cunning : The first Words
We form their Tongues with , are licentious Jests :
Can it call Whore ?
cry Bastard ?
O then kiss it !
A witty Child ! Can't swear ?
The Father 's Darling !
Give it two Plums .
Nay , rather than't shall learn
No Bawdy Song , the Mother her self will teach it !
But this is in the Infancy , the Days
Of the Long Coat ; when it puts on the Breeches ,
It will put off all this .
I , it is like ,
When it is gone into the Bone already .
No, no ; this Dye goes deeper than the Coat ,
Or Shirt , or Skin : it stains unto the Liver ,
And Heart , in some : And , rather than it should not ,
Note what we Fathers do ! Look how we live !
What Mistrisses we keep ! at what Expence ,
In our Son 's eyes ! where they may handle our Gifts ,
Hear our lascivious Courtships , see our Dalliance ,
Taste of the same provoking Meats with with us ,
To ruin of our State ! Nay , when our own
Portion is fled , to prey on their Remainder ,
We call them into Fellowship of Vice ;
Bait 'em with the young Chamber-maid , to seal ;
And teach 'em all bad ways to buy Affection .
This is one Path : But there are millions more ,
In which we spoil our own , with leading them .
Well , I thank Heaven , I never yet was he
That travell 'd with my Son , before Sixteen ,
To shew him the Venetian Courtezans ;
Nor read the Grammar of Cheating , I had made ,
To my sharp Boy , at Twelve ; repeating still
The Rule , Get Money ; still , Get Money , Boy ;
No mater by what Means ; Money will do
More , Boy , than my Lord 's Letter .
Neither have I
Drest Snails or Mushroms curiously before him ,
Perfum 'd my Sauces , and taught him to make 'em ;
Preceding still , with my grey Gluttony ,
At all the Ord 'naries , and only fear 'd
His Palate should degenerate , not his Manners .
These are the Trade of Fathers now ; however ,
My Son , I hope , hath met within my Threshold
None of these Household Precedents , which are strong ,
And swift , to rape Youth to their Precipice .
But let the House at home be ne 'er so clean
Swept , or kept sweet from Filth , nay Dust and Cobwebs ;
If he will live abroad with his Companions ,
In Dung and Leystals , it is worth a Fear .
Nor is the danger of Conversing less
Than
Than all that I have mention 'd of example .
My Master ?
nay , faith have at you : I am
flesht now , I have sped so well .
Worshipful Sir , I be-
seech you , respect the estate of a poor Soldier ; I am
asham 'd of this base course of life ( God 's my comfort )
but extremity provokes me to't , what remedy ?
I have not for you , now .
Bray By the Faith I bear unto Truth , Gentleman , it
is no ordinary custom in me , but only to preserve Man-
I protest to you , a Man I have been , a Man I
may be , by your sweet Bounty .
'Pray thee , good Friend , be satisfied .
Good Sir , by that Hand , you may do the part
of a kind Gentleman , in lending a poor Soldier the
price of two Cans of Beer , ( a matter of small value )
the King of Heaven shall pay you , and I shall rest thank -
ful : sweet Worship ? ?
Nay , and you be so importunate ? ? ?
Oh , tender Sir , need will have his course : I
was not made to this vile use ! well , the edge of the Ene -
my could not have abated me so much : It 's hard , when
a Man hath serv 'd in his Princes cause , and
be thus ? ?
Honourable worship , let me de- He weeps .
rive a small piece of Silver from you , it shall
not be given in the course of time ; by this good Ground ,
I was fain to pawn my Rapier last Night for a poor
Supper ; I had suck 'd the Hilts long before , I am a Pa -
gan else : sweet Honour .
Believe me , I am taken with some wonder ,
To think , a Fellow of thy outward presence ,
Should ( in the frame , and fashion of his mind )
Be so degenerate , and sordid-base !
Art thou a Man ?
and sham 'st thou not to beg ?
To practise such a servile kind of life ?
Why , were thy Education ne 'r so mean ,
Having thy Limbs , a thousand fairer courses
Offer themselves to thy Election .
Either the Wars might still supply thy wants ,
Or Service of some vertuous Gentleman ,
Or honest Labour : nay , what can I name
But would become thee better than to beg ?
But Men of thy condition feed on sloth ,
As doth the Beetle , on the Dung she breeds in ,
Not caring how the mettal of your minds
Is eaten with the rust of idleness .
Now , afore me , what e 'er he be , that should
Relieve a Person of thy Quality ,
While thou insists in this loose desperate course ,
I would esteem the sin , not thine , but his .
Faith Sir , I would gladly find some other course ,
if so ? ?
I , youl 'd gladly find it , but you will not seek it .
Alas , Sir , where should a Man seek ?
in the
Wars , there 's no ascent by desert in these days ; but ?
and for Service , would it were as soon purchast , as wisht
for ( the Air 's my comfort ) I know , what I would
say ? ?
What 's thy name ?
Please you , Fitz-Sword , Sir .
Fitz-Sword ?
Say that a Man should entertain thee now ,
Would 'st thou be honest , humble , just , and true ?
Sir , by the place , and honour of a Soldier ? ?
Nay , nay , I like not those affected Oaths ;
Speak plainly Man : what think 'st thou of my words ?
Nothing , Sir , but wish my Fortunes were as hap -
py , as my Service should be honest .
Well , follow me , I 'll prove thee , if thy deeds
Will carry a proportion to thy words .
Yes Sir , straight , I 'll but garter my Hose .
Oh
that my Belly were hoopt now , for I am ready to burst
with laughing ! never was Bottle or Bag-pipe fuller .
' Slid , was there ever seen a Fox in years to betray him -
self thus ?
now shall I be possest of all his counsels :
and by that Conduit , my young Master .
Well , he is
resolv 'd to prove my honesty ; faith , and I am resolv 'd
to prove his patience : oh I shall abuse him intollera -
This small piece of service will bring him clean
out of love with the Soldier for ever .
He will never
come within the sign of it , the sight of a Cassock , or a
Musket rest again .
He will hate the Musters at Mile -
end for it , to his dying day .
It 's no matter , let the
World think me a bad counterfeit , if I cannot give
him the slip , at an instant : why , this is better than to
have staid his Journey ! well , I 'll follow him : oh , how I
long to be imployed !
you too .
Oh , I came not there to Night .
Your Brother delivered us as much .
Who ?
my Brother Downright ?
Mr. Well-bred , I know not in what kind you
hold me ; but let me say to you this : as sure as honour , I
esteem it so much out of the Sun-shine of reputation ,
to throw the least beam of regard upon such a ?
Sir , I must hear no ill words of my Brother .
I protest to you , as I have a thing to be sav 'd a -
bout me , I never saw any Gentleman-like-part ? ?
Good Captain , faces about , to some other dis -
With your leave , Sir , and there were no more
Men living upon the face of the Earth , I should not fan-
cy him , by St .
Troth , nor I , he is of a rustical cut , I know not
how : he doth not carry himself like a Gentleman of
fashion ? ? ?
Oh , Mr. Matthew , that 's a grace peculiar but to
a few ; quos ?quus amavit Jupiter .
I understand you , Sir .
No question , you do , or you do not ,
Young Kno'-
well enters .
Sir . Ned Kno'well ! by my Soul welcome ;
how dost thou sweet Spirit , my Genius ?
' Slid I shall love Apollo , and the mad The-
spian Girls the better , while I live , for this ; my dear
Fury : now , I see there 's some love in thee ! Sirrah , these
be the two I writ to thee of ( nay , what a drowsie hu-
mour is this now ?
why dost thou not speak ?
Yes , I 'll be sworn , I was ne 'er guilty of read -
ing the like ; match it in all Pliny , or Symmachus Epistles ,
and I 'll have my judgment burn 'd in the Ear for a
Rogue : make much of thy vein , for it is inimitable .
But I marle what Camel it was , that had the carriage
of it ?
for , doubtless , he was no ordinary Beast that
brought it !
Why ?
Why , saist thou ?
why dost thou think that
any reasonable Creature , especially in the Morning ( the
sober time of the day too ) could have mis-tane my Father for me ?
' Slid , you jest , I hope ?
Indeed , the best use we can turn it too is to
make a jest on't , now : but I 'll assure you , my Father
had the full view o ' your flourishing stile , some hour be-
fore I saw it .
What a dull Slave was this ?
But Sirrah , what said
he to it , i'faith ?
Nay , I know not what he said : but I have a
shrewd guess what he thought .
What ?
what ?
C E.
Marry , that thou art some strange dissolute
young Fellow , and I a grain or two better , for keeping
thee company .
Tut , that thought is like the Moon in her last
quarter , 'twill change shortly : but , Sirrah , I pray thee
be acquainted with my two hang by 's here ; thou wilt
take exceeding pleasure in 'em , if thou hear 'st 'em once
go : my Wind-instruments .
I 'll wind 'em up ? ?
but
what strange piece of silence is this ?
the sign of the
dumb Man ?
Oh , Sir , a Kinsman of mine , one that may
make your Musick the fuller , and he please , he has his
humour , Sir .
Oh , what ist ?
what ist ?
Nay , I 'll neither do your Judgment , nor his
Folly that wrong , as to prepare your apprehension : I 'll
leave him to the mercy o'your search , if you can take
him , so .
Well , Captain Bobadill , Mr. Matthew 'pray you
know this Gentleman here , he is a Friend of mine , and
one that will deserve your affection .
I know not
your name Sir , but I shall be glad of any occasion , to
render me more familiar to you .
My name is Mr. Stephen , Sir , I am this Gentle -
man 's own Cousin , Sir , his Father is mine Uncle , Sir : I
am somewhat melancholy , but you shall command me ,
Sir , in whatsoever is incident to a Gentleman .
Sir , I must tell you this , I am no general Man ,
but for Mr. Well-bred 's sake (you may embrace it at
what height of favour you please ) I do communicate
with you , and conceive you to be a Gentleman of
some parts ; I love few words .
And I fewer , Sir , I have scarce enough to thank
But are you indeed , Sir so given to it ?
I truly , Sir , I am mightily given to melan-
Oh , it 's your only fine humour , Sir , your true
melancholy breeds your perfect fine wit , Sir : I am me-
lancholy my self , divers times , Sir , and then do I no
more but take Pen and Paper presently , and over-
flow you half a score , or a dozen of Sonnets at a sit-
Sure he utters them then by the gross . )
Truly , Sir , and I love such things out of mea -
I'faith , better than in measure , I 'll under-
Why , I pray you , Sir , make use of my Study , it 's
at your service .
I thank you , Sir , I shall be bold , I warrant you ;
have you a Stool there , to be melancholy upon ?
That I have , Sir , and some Papers there of mine
own doing , at idle hours , that you 'll say there 's some
sparks of wit in 'em , when you see them .
Would the sparks would kindle once , and be-
come a fire amongst 'em , I might see self-love burnt for
her Heresie .
Cousin , is it well ?
am I melancholy enough ?
Oh I , excellent !
Captain Bobadill , why muse you so ?
He is meloncholy too .
Faith , Sir , I was thinking of a most honourable
piece of service , was perform 'd to morrow , being
Mark 's day , shall be some ten years , now .
In what place , Captain ?
Why , at the beleag 'ring of Strigonium , where , in
less than two hours , seven hundred resolute Gentlemen ,
as any were in Europe , lost their lives upon the breach .
I 'll tell you , Gentlemen , it was the first , but the best
Leaguer that ever I beheld with these Eyes , except the
taking in of ? ?
what do you call it , last year , by the
Genoways , but that ( of all other ) was the most fatal
and dangerous exploit that ever I was rang 'd in , since I
first bore Arms before the face of the Enemy , as I am a
Gentleman , and a Soldier .
' So , I had as lief as an Angel I could swear as
well as that Gentleman .
Then , you were a Servitor at both it seems ; at
Strigonium , and what do you call 't ?
O Lord , Sir , by St .
George , I was the first Man
that entred the breach : and , had I not effected it with
resolution , I had been slain if I had had a million of
' Twas pitty you had not ten ; a Cats and your
own , i'faith .
But , was it possible ?
Pray you , mark this discourse , Sir .
So I do . )
I assure you (upon my Reputation ) 'tis true , and
your self shall confess .
You must bring me to the rack , first .
Observe me judicially , sweet Sir , they had
planted me three Demi-culverings just in the mouth of
the breach ; now , Sir , ( as we were to give on ) their
Master-gunner , ( a Man of no mean skill and mark , you
must think ) confronts me with his Linstock , ready to
give fire ; I spying his intendment , discharg 'd my Pe-
trionel in his Bosom , and with these single Arms , my
poor Rapier ran violently upon the Moors that guarded
the Ordnance , and put 'em pell-mell to the Sword .
To the Sword ?
to the Rapier , Captain ?
Oh , it was a good figure observ 'd , Sir ! but
did you all this , Captain , without hurting your Blade ?
Without any impeach o ' the Earth : you shall
perceive Sir . It is the most fortunate Weapon that
ever rid on poor Gentleman 's Thigh : shall I tell you ,
Sir ?
you talk of Morglay , Excalibur , Durindana , or so :
tut , I lend no credit to that is fabled of 'em , I know the
vertue of mine own , and therefore I dare the boldlier
maintain it .
I mar 'l whether it be a Toledo , or no ?
A most perfect Toledo , I assure you , Sir .
I have a Country-man of his here .
Pray you , let 's see , Sir : yes faith , it is !
This a Toledo ?
Why do you pish , Captain ?
A Fleming , by Heaven .
I 'll buy them for a Guil-
der apiece , an' I would have a thousand of them .
How say you , Cousin ?
I told you thus much .
Where bought you it , Master Stephen ?
Of a scurvy Rogue Soldier ( a hundred of Lice
go with him ) he swore it was a Toledo .
A poor provant Rapier , no better .
Mass , I think it be , indeed , now I look on't
Nay , the longer you look on't , the worse .
Put
it up , put it up .
Well , I will put it up ; but by ?
( I ha' forgot
the Captains Oath , I thought to ha' sworn by it ) an'
e 'er I meet him ? ?
O , it is past help now , Sir , you must have pa-
Horsoon Cunny-catching Raskal ! I could eat
the very Hilts for anger .
A sign of good digestion : you have a Ostrich -
stomach , Cousin .
A stomach ?
would I had him here , you should
see an' I had a stomach .
It 's better as 'tis : come , Gentlemen , shall we go ?
AMiracle , Cousin , look here ! look here !
Oh , Gods lid , by your leave , do you know
me , Sir ?
I Sir , I know you by sight .
You sold me a Rapier , did you not ?
Yes marry did I , Sir .
You said , it was a Toledo , ha ?
True , I did so .
But it is none .
No Sir , I confess it , it is none .
Do you confess it ?
Gentlemen , bear witness , he
has confest it .
By Gods will , an' you had not confest
it ? ? ?
Oh Cousin , forbear , forbear .
Nay , I have done , Cousin .
Why , you have done like a Gentleman , he has
confest it , what would you more ?
Yet , by his leave , he is a Raskall , under his fa -
vour , do you see ?
I , by his leave , he is , and under favour : a
pretty peice of Civility ! Sirrah , how dost thou like
him ?
Oh it 's a most precious Fool , make much on him :
I can compare him to nothing more happily , than a
Drum ; for every one may play upon him .
No, no , a Childs Whistle were far the fitter .
Sir , shall I intreat a word with you ?
With me , Sir ?
you have not another Toledo to
sell , ha' you ?
You are conceited , Sir ; your Name is Master
Kno'well , as I take it ?
You are i' the right ; you mean not to pro-
ceed in the Catechism , do you ?
No Sir , I am none of that Coat .
Of as bare a Coat , though ; well , say Sir .
Faith Sir , I am but Servant to the Drum ex -
traordinary , and indeed ( this smoky varnish being
washt off , and three or four Patches remov 'd ) I appear
your Worship in Reversion , after the decease of your
good Father , Brain-worm .
Brain-worm ! ' Slight , what breath of a Conju-
rer hath blown thee hither in this shape ?
The breath o ' your Letter , Sir , this Morning :
the same that blew you to the Wind mill , and your Fa -
ther after you .
My Father !
Nay , never start , 'tis true , he has follow 'd you
over the Fields by the Foot , as you would do a Hare i'
the Snow .
Sirrah , Well-bred , what shall we do , Sirrah ?
my Father is come over after me .
Thy Father , where is he ?
At Justice Clement 's House , in Coleman Street ,
where he but stays my return ; and then ? ? ?
Who 's this ?
Brain-worm ?
The same , Sir .
Why how , in the name of wit , com 'st thou
transmuted thus ?
Faith , a Device , a Device : nay , for the love of
Reason , Gentlemen , and avoiding the Danger , stand
not here ; withdraw and I 'll tell you all .
But art thou sure he will stay thy return ?
Do I live , Sir ?
what a question is that ?
We 'll prorogue his Expectation then , a little :
Brain-worm , thou shalt go with us .
Come on Gentle -
men ; nay , I pray thee , sweet Ned , droop not ; 'heart ,
an' our Wits be so wretchedly dull , that one old plod -
ding Brain can out strip us all , would we were e 'ne prest
to make Porters of , and serve out the Remnant of our
days in Thames street , or at Custom-house Key , in a Ci-
vil War against the Carmen .
Amen , Amen , Amen , say I.
Did you speak with him ?
He will expect you , Sir , with in this half
Has he the Money ready , can you tell ?
Yes , Sir , the Money was brought in last night .
O , that 's well : fetch me my Cloke , my Cloke .
Stay let me see , an hour to go and come ;
I , that will be the least : and then 'twill be
An hour before I can dispatch with him ,
Or very near : well , I will say two hours .
Two hours ?
ha ?
things never dreamt of yet ,
May be contriv 'd , I , and effected too ,
In two hours absence : well , I will not go .
Two hours ! no , fleering Opportunity ,
I will not give your subtilty that scope .
Who will not judge him worthy to be robb 'd ,
That set his Doors wide open to a Thief ,
And shews the Fellon where his Treasure lies ?
Again , what earthly Spirit but will attempt
To taste the Fruit of Beauties golden Tree ,
When leaden sleep seals up the Dragons Eyes ?
I will not go .
Business , go by for once .
No, Beauty , no ; you are of too good caract ,
To be left so , without a guard , or open !
Your luster too 'll inflame at any distance ,
Draw Courtship to you , as a Jet doth Straws ,
Put motion in a Stone , strike Fire from Ice ,
Nay , make a Porter leap you with his burden !
You must be then kept up close , and well watch 'd ,
For , give you opportunity , no Quick-sand
Devoures or swallows swifter ! He that lends
His Wife ( if she be fair ) or time or place ,
Compels her to be false .
I will not go .
The dangers are too many .
And , then , the dressing
Is a most main attractive ! Our great Heads
Within the City never were in safety
Since our Wives wore these little Caps : I 'll change 'em ,
I 'll change 'em straight in mine .
Mine shall no more
Wear three pil 'd Acorns , to make my Horns ake .
Nor will I go .
I am resolv 'd for that .
Carry in my Cloke again .
Yet stay .
Yet do too .
I will defer going on all occasions .
Sir , Snare your Scrivener will be there with th '
That 's true ! Fool on me ! I had clean forgot it ;
I must go .
What 's a Clock ?
Exchange-time ,
' Heart , then will Well-bred presently be here
too ,
With one or other of his loose Consorts .
I am a Knave , if I know what to say ,
What course to take , or which way to resolve .
My Brain methinks is like an Hour-glass ,
Wherein my 'maginations run like Sands ,
Filling up Time ; but then are turn 'd and turn 'd :
So that I know not what to stay upon ,
And less to put in act .
It shall be so .
Nay , I dare build upon his secresie ,
He knows not to deceive me .
Thomas ?
Yet now I have bethought me too , I will not .
Thomas , is Cob within ?
I think he be , Sir .
But he 'll prate too , there 's no Speech of him .
No, there were no Man o ' the Earth to Thomas ,
If I durst trust him ; there is all the doubt .
But should he have a chink in him , I were gone ,
C2 Lost
Lost i' my fame for ever , talk for th ' Exchange .
The manner he hath stood with , till this present ,
Doth promise no such change , what should I fear then ?
Well , come what will , I 'll tempt my fortune once .
Thomas ? ?
you may deceive me , but , I hope ? ?
Your love to me is more ?
Sir , if a Servants
Duty , with Faith , may be call 'd love , you are
More than in hope , you are possess 'd of it .
I thank you heartily Thomas .
I have Thomas ,
A secret to impart unto you ? ?
but ,
When once you have it , I must seal your Lips up :
( So far I tell you Thomas . )
Sir , for that ? ?
Nay , hear me out .
Think I esteem you Thomas ,
When I will let you in thus to my private .
It is a thing fits nearer to my crest ,
Than thou art 'ware of , Thomas .
If thou should 'st
Reveal it , but ? ? ?
How ! I reveal it ?
Nay ,
I do not think thou would 'st ; but if thou should 'st ,
' Twere a great weakness .
A great treachery .
Give it no other name .
Thou wilt not do 't , then ?
Sir , if I do , Mankind disclaim me ever .
He will not swear , he has some Reservation ,
Some conceal 'd purpose , and close meaning sure ;
Else ( being urg 'd so much ) how should he choose
but lend an Oath to all this Protestation ?
He 's no Precisian , that I am certain of .
Nor rigid Roman Catholick .
He 'll play
At Fayles , and at Tick-tack , I have heard him swear .
What should I think of it ?
urge him again ,
And by some other way : I will do so .
Well Thomas , thou hast sworn not to disclose ;
Yes , you did swear ?
Not yet , Sir , but I will ,
Please you ? ?
No, Thomas , I dare take thy word .
But , if thou wilt swear , do as thou think 'st good ;
I am resolv 'd without it ; at thy pleasure .
By my Souls safety then , Sir , I protest .
My tongue shall ne 're take knowledg of a word
Deliver 'd me in nature of your trust .
It 's too much , these Ceremonies need not ,
I know thy Faith to be as firm as Rock .
Thomas , come hither , near : we cannot be
Too private in this business .
So it is ,
( Now he has sworn , I dare the safelier ventuer )
I have of late , by divers Observations ? ?
( But whether his Oath can bind him , yea , or no ,
Being not taken lawfully ?
ha ?
say you ?
I will ask Counsel ere I do proceed : )
Thomas , it will be now too long to stay ,
I 'll spy some fitter time soon , or to morrow .
Sir , at your pleasure ?
I will think .
And
Thomas ,
I pray you search the Books 'gainst my return ,
For the Receipts 'twixt me and Traps .
I will , Sir .
And hear you , if your Mistris Brother Well -
bred
Chance to bring hither any Gentlemen ,
Ere I come back , let one straight bring me word .
Very well , Sir . Kit .
To the Exchange ; do you
hear !
Or here in Colman Street , to Justice Clements .
Forget it not , nor be not out of the way .
I will not , Sir . Kit .
I pray you have a care
Or whether he come , or no , if any other
Stranger , or else fail not to send me word .
I shall not , Sir . Kit .
Be 't you special Bu-
siness
Now to remember it .
Sir , I warrant you .
But , Thomas , this is not the Secret , Thomas ,
I told you of .
No, Sir . I do suppose it .
Believe me , it is not .
Sir , I do believe
By Heaven it is not , that 's enough .
But Thomas ,
I would not you should utter it , do you see ?
To any Creature living ; yet I care not .
Well , I must hence .
Thomas , conceive thus much
It was a tryal of you , when I meant
So deep a Secret to you , I mean not this ,
But that I have to tell you ; this is nothing , this !
But Thomas , keep this from my Wife , I charge you ,
Lock 'd up in silence , Mid-night , buried here .
No greater Hell than to be slave to Fear .
Lock 'd up in silence , Mid night , buried here !
Whence should this flood of Passion ( trow ) take head ?
ha ?
Best dream no longer of this running humour ,
For fear I sink ! the violence of the Stream
Already hath transported me so far ,
That I can feel no ground at all ! but soft ,
Oh , 'tis our Water-bearer ; somewhat has crost him
what tell you me of Fasting days ?
' Slid , would they were all on a light Fire for
me : They say the whole World shall be consum 'd
with Fire one day , but would I had these Ember-
weeks and villanous Fridays burnt in the mean time , and
then ? ? ?
Why , how now Cob ?
what moves thee to this
Choler ?
ha ?
Collar , Master Thomas ?
I scorn your Collar , I
Sir , I am none o ' your Cart-horse , though I carry
and draw Water .
An' you offer to ride me with your
Collar or Halter either , I may hap shew you a Jades
trick , Sir .
O , you 'll slip your Head out of the Collar ?
why goodman Cob you mistake me .
Nay I have my Rheum , and I can be angry as
well as another , Sir .
Thy Rhume Cob ?
thy Humour , thy Humour ?
thou mistak 'st .
Humour ?
mack , I think it be so indeed : what
is that Humour ?
some rare thing I warrant .
Mary I 'll tell thee Cob : It is a Gentleman-like
Monster , bred in the special gallantry of our Time , by
Affectation ; and fed by Folly .
How ?
must it be fed ?
Oh I , Humour is nothing if it be not fed .
Didst thou never hear that ?
it 's a common Phrase , Feed
my Humour .
I 'll none on it : Humour , avant , I know you
not , be gone .
Let who will make hungry Meals for
your Monster-ship , it shall not be I.
Feed you , quoth
he ?
' Slid , I ha' much ado to feed my self ; especially
on these lean rascally days too ; and't had been any
other day but a Fasting-day ( a Plague on them all for
me ) by this Light , one might have done the Common -
wealth good Service , and have drown 'd them all i' the
Flood Two or three hundred thousand years ago .
O ,
I do stomach them hugely ! I have a Maw now ,
and 'twere for Sir Bevis his Horse , against 'em .
I pray thee , good Cob , what makes thee so out
of love with Fasting-days ?
Marry that which will make any Man out of
love with 'em , I think : their bad Conditions , an' you
will needs know .
First , they are of a Flemish breed
I am sure on't , for they raven up more Butter than
all the days of the Week beside : Next they stink of
Fish and Leek-porridge miserable : thirdly , they 'll
keep a Man devoutly hungry all day , and at night
send him supperless to Bed .
Indeed these are Faults , Cob .
Nay , and this were all , 'twere something ; but
they are the only known Enemies to my Generation .
AFasting day no sooner comes , but my Linage goes to
wrack , poor Cobs , they smoak for it , they are made
Martyrs o ' the Gridiron , they melt in passion : And
your Maids too know this , and yet would have me turn
Hannibal , and eat my own Flesh and
a Red Her-
My Princely Couz , fear no-
thing ; I have not the heart to devour
you , an' I might be made as rich as
King Cophetua .
O that I had room for
my Tears , I could weep Salt-water enough now to
preserve the Lives of ten thousand of my Kin .
But
I may curse none but these filthy Almanacks ; for
an't were not for them , these Days of Persecution
would ne 'er be known .
I 'll be hang 'd an' some Fish -
monger 's Son do not make of 'em , and puts in more
Fasting days than he should do , because he would utter
his Father 's dried Stock-fish and stinking Conger .
' Slight , peace , thou'lt be beaten like a Stock-fish
else : Here 's Mr. Matthew .
Now must I look out for a
Messenger to my Master .
BEshrew me , but it was an absolute good Jest , and
exceedingly well carried .
I , and our Ignorance maintain 'd it as well , did
it not ?
Yes faith ; but was't possible thou should 'st not
know him ?
I forgive Mr. Stehpen , for he is Stupidity it
' Fore God , not I , an' I might have been join 'd
Patten with one of the Seven Wise Masters for knowing
He had so writhen himself into the Habit of one
of your poor Infantry , your decay 'd , ruinous , worm -
eaten Gentlemen of the Round ; such as have vowed to
sit on the Skirts of the City , like your Provost and his
half-dozen of Halberdiers do what they can ; and have
translated Begging out of the old Hackney-pace , to a
fine easie Amble , and made it run as smooth on the
Tongue as a shove-groat Shilling .
Into the Likeness of
one of these Reformado 's had he moulded himself so per-
him ) thou would 'st have sworn , he might have been
Serjeant Major , if not Lieutenant-Colonel to the Re-
Why Brain-worm , who would have thought thou
hadst been such an Artificer ?
An Artificer ?
an Architect ! Except a Man
had studied Begging all his Life-time , and been a Wea -
ver of Language from his Infancy for the cloathing of
it , I never saw his Rival .
Where got 'st thou this Coat , I mar 'le ?
Of a Houndsditch man , Sir ; one of the Devil 's
neer Kinsmen , a Broker .
That cannot be , if the Proverb hold ; for , A
crafty Knave needs no Broker .
True , Sir : But I did need a Broker , Ergo .
( Well put off . )
No crafty Knave , you 'l say .
Tut , he has more of these Shifts .
And yet where I have one , the Broker has ten ,
Francis , Martin : Ne 'er a one to be found now ?
What a spite 's this ?
How now , Thomas ?
Is my Brother Kitely within ?
No Sir , my Master went forth e 'en now ; but
Master Downright is within .
Cob , what Cob ?
Is he gone
too ?
Whither went your Master , Thomas , canst thou
tell ?
I know not ; to Justice Clements , I think Sir-
Justice Clement ! what 's he ?
Why , dost thou not know him ?
He is a City -
Magistrate , a Justice here , an excellent good Lawyer ,
and a great Scholar ; but the only mad , merry old Fel-
low in Europe .
I shew 'd him you the other day .
Oh , is that he ?
I remember him now .
Good
faith , and he has a very strange Presence , methinks ; it
shews as if he stood out of the Rank from other Men :
I have heard many of his jests i' the University .
They
say , he will commit a Man for taking the Wall of his
I , or wearing his Cloke on one Shoulder , or ser-
ving of God ; any thing indeed , if it come in the way
of his Humour .
Gasper , Martin , Cob : ' Heart , where should they
be trow ?
Master Kitely 's Man , pray thee vouchsafe us the
lighting of this Match .
Fire on your Match : No time but now to vouch -
safe ?
Francis , Cob .
Body o ' me ! Here 's the Remainder of Seven
Pound since yesterday was seven-night .
' Tis your right
Trinidado : Did you never take any , Master Stephen ?
No truly , Sir ; but I 'll learn to take it now , since
you commend it so .
Sir , Believe me (upon my Relation ) for what I
tell you , the World shall not reprove .
I have been in
the Indies ( where this Herb grows ) where neither my
self , nor a dozen Gentlemen more ( of my knowledge )
have received the taste of any other Nutriment in the
World , for the space of one and twenty Weeks , but the
Fume of this Simple only .
Therefore , it cannot be , but
'tis most Divine .
Further , take it in the nature , in the true
kind , so it makes an Antidote , that had you taken the
most deadly poisonous Plant in all Italy , it should expel
it , and clarifie you , with as much ease as I speak .
And
for your green Wound , your Belsamum and your St .
John 's Wort are all meer Gulleries and Trash to it , espe-
cially your Trinidado ; your Nicotian is good too .
Icould say what I know of the Vertue of it , for the ex -
pulsion of Rhewms , raw Humours , Crudities , Obstru-
ctions , with a thousand of this kind ; but I profess my
self no Quacksalver .
Only thus much ; By Hercules , I
do hold it , and will affirm it ( before any Prince in Eu-
rope ) to be the most sovereign and precious Weed that
ever the Earth tendred to the use of Man .
This Speech would ha' done decently in a
Tabacco-trader 's Mouth .
At Justice Clement 's he is , in the middle of Cole -
Oh , oh !
Where 's the Match I gave thee , Master Kitely 's
Man ?
Would his Match , and he , and Pipe and all were
at Sancto Domingo .
I had forgot it .
By Gods me , I mar 'le what pleasure or felicity
they have in taking this roguish Tabacco! It 's good for
nothing but to choak a Man , and fill him full of Smoke
and Embers : There were four died out of one House
last week with taking of it , and two more the Bell went
for yesternight ; one of them ( they say ) will ne 'er scape
it ; he voided a Bushel of Soot yesterday , upward and
By the Stocks , an' there were no wiser
Men than I , I 'd have it present whipping , Man or Wo -
man , that should but deal with a Tabacco-pipe ; why ,
it will stifle them all in the end , as many as use it ; it 's
little better than Ratsbane or Rosaker .
Oh , good Captain , hold , hold .
You base Cullion , you .
Sir ,
Sir , here 's your Match .
Come , thou must needs
be talking too tho ' art well enough serv 'd .
Nay , he will not meddle with his Match , I
warrant you : Well , it shall be dear Beating , an' I live .
Do you prate ?
do you murmur ?
Nay , good Captain , will you regard the Hu-
mour of a Fool ?
Away , Knave .
Thomas , get him away .
A horson filthy Slave , a Dung-worm , an Excre -
ment ! Body o ' C?sar , but that I scorn to let forth so
mean a Spirit , I'ld ha' stabb 'd him to the Earth .
Marry , the Law forbid , Sir .
By Pharaoh 's Foot , I would ha' done it .
Oh , he swears most admirably ! ( By Pharaoh 's
Foot , Body o ' C?sar ) I shall never do it sure , ( Upon
mine Honour , and by St .
George ) No, I ha' not the right
Master Stephen , will you any ?
By this Air , the
most Divine Tabacco that ever I drunk !
None , I thank you , Sir . O , this Gentleman do 's
it rarely too ! but nothing like the other .
By this Air ,
as I am a Gentleman : By ? ? ?
Master , glance , glance ! Master Wel-bred !
As I have somewhat to be saved , I protest ? ?
You are a Fool , it needs no Affidavit .
Cousin , will you any Tabacco ?
I , Sir ! Upon my Reputation ? ? ?
How now , Cousin !
I protest , as I am a Gentleman , but not Soldier ,
indeed ? ? ?
No, Master Stephen ?
As I remember , your Name
is entered in the Artillery garden .
I , Sir , that 's true .
Cousin , may I swear , As I am
a Soldier , by that ?
O yes , that you may ; it 's all you have for
your Money .
Then , as I am a Gentleman , and a Soldier , it is
Divine Tabacco .
But soft , where 's Mr. Matthew ?
gone ?
No, Sir ; they went in here .
O , let 's follow them : Master Matthew is gone to
salute his Mistriss in Verse ; we shall ha' the happiness to
hear some of his Poetry now ; he never comes unfur-
Brain-worm ?
Brain-worm ?
where ?
is this Brain-worm ?
I , Cousin ; no words on it , upon your Gentility .
Not I , body of me , by this Air , St .
George , and
the Foot of Pharaoh .
Rare ! Your Cousin 's Discourse is simply drawn
out with Oaths .
' Tis larded with 'em ; a kind of French Dres -
sing , if you love it .
Marry Sir , your Brother , Master Well-bred ? ?
Tut , beside him : what Strangers are there , Man ?
Strangers ?
Let me see , one , two ; mass I know
not well , there are so many .
How ?
so many ?
I , there 's some five , or six of them at the most .
A swarm , a swarm !
Spite of the Devil , how they sting my Head
With forked Stings , thus wide and large ! But , Cob ,
How long hast thou been coming hither , Cob ?
A little while , Sir .
Didst thou come running ?
No, Sir .
Nay , then I am familiar with thy haste !
Bane to my Fortunes , what meant I to marry ?
I , that before was rank 'd in such Content ,
My Mind at rest too , in so soft a Peace ,
Being free Master of mine own free Thoughts ,
And now become a Slave ?
What , never sigh ,
Be of good cheer , Man ; for thou art a Cuckold :
' Tis done , 'tis done ! Nay , when such flowing Store ,
Plenty it self , falls in my Wives Lap ,
The Cornucopi? will be mine , I know .
But , Cob ,
What Entertainment had they ?
I am sure
My Sister and my Wife would bid them welcom ! ha ?
Like enough , Sir ; yet I heard not a word of it .
No ; their Lips were seal 'd with Kisses , and the voice
Drown 'd in a Flood of Joy , at their arrival ,
Had lost her Motion , State , and Faculty .
Cob , which of them was't that first kist my Wife ?
( My Sister , I should say ) my Wife , alas !
I fear not her .
Ha ?
who was it , saist thou ?
By my troth , Sir , will you have the troth of it ?
Oh I , good Cob , I pray thee heartily .
Then I am a Vagabond , and fitter for Bridewel
than your Worships Company , if I saw any body to be
kist , unless they would have kist the Post in the middle
of the Warehouse ; for there I left them all at their Ta -
bacco , with a pox .
How ?
were they not gone in then e 'er thou
cam 'st ?
O no , Sir .
Spite of the Devil ! what do I stay here then ?
Cob , follow me .
Nay , soft and fair , I have Eggs on the Spit ; I
cannot go yet , Sir . Now am I , for some five and fifty
Reasons , hammering , hammering Revenge : Oh for
three or four Gallons of Vinegar , to sharpen my Wits .
Revenge , Vinegar Revenge , Vinegar and Mustard Re-
venge ! Nay , an' he had not lien in my House , 'twould
never have griev 'd me ; but being my Guest , one that
I 'll be sworn my Wife has lent him her Smock off her
Back , while his one Shirt has been at washing ; paw n 'd
her Neck-kerchers for clean Bands for him ; sold almost
all my Platters , to buy him Tabacco ; and he to turn
Monster of Ingratitude , and strike his lawful Host !
Well , I hope to raise up an Hoast of Fury for't : Here
comes Justice Clement .
I , Sir .
' Heart o ' me ! what made him leave us so ab -
ruptly ! How now , Sirrah ?
what make you here ?
what
would you have , ha ?
An't please your Worship , I am a poor Neigh -
bour of your Worships ? ?
A poor Neighbour of mine ?
Why , speak poor
I dwell , Sir , at the Sign of the Water-tankard ,
hard by the Green Lattice : I have paid Scot and Lot
there any time this eighteen Years .
To the Green Lattice ?
No, Sir , to the Parish : Marry , I have seldom
scap 'd scot-free at the Lattice .
O , well ! What Business has my poor Neigh -
bour with me ?
An't like your Worship , I am come to crave the
Peace of your Worship .
Of me , Knave ?
Peace of me , Knave ?
Did I
ever hurt thee , or threaten thee , or wrong thee ?
ha ?
No, Sir ; but your Worships Warrant for one
that has wrong 'd me , Sir : His Arms are at too much
liberty , I would fain have them bound to a Treaty of
Peace , an' my Credit could compass it with your Wor-
Thou
Thou goest far enough about for't , I am sure .
Why , dost thou go in danger of thy life for him ,
Friend ?
No, Sir ; but I go in danger of my death every
hour , by his means : an' I die within a twelve-month and
a day , I may swear by the Law of the Land that he
kill 'd me .
How ?
how Knave ?
swear he kill 'd thee ?
and
by the Law ?
what pretence ?
what Colour hast thou for
that ?
Marry , an't please your Worship , both Black
and Blue ; Colour enough , I warrant you .
I have it
here to shew your Worship .
What is he that gave you this , Sirrah ?
A Gentleman and a Soldier , he says he is , o ' the
City here .
A Soldier o ' the City ?
What call you him ?
Captain Bobadil .
Bobadil ?
And why did he bob and beat you ,
Sirrah ?
How began the quarrel betwixt you , ha ?
speak
truly Knave , I advise you .
Marry , indeed , an't please your Worship , only
because I spake against their vagrant Tobacco , as I came
by 'em when they were taking on't ; for nothing else .
Ha ! you speak against Tobacco ?
Formall , his
What 's your name , Sirrah ?
Oliver , Sir , Oliver Cob , Sir .
Tell Oliver Cob he shall go to the Gaol Formall .
Oliver Cob , my Master , Justice Clement says , you
shall go to the Gaol .
O , I beseech your Worship , for God 's sake , dear
Master Justice .
Nay , God 's precious , an' such Drunkards and
Tankards as you are , come to dispute of Tobacco once ,
I have done ! away with him .
O , good Master Justice , sweet old Gentleman .
Sweet Oliver , would I could do thee any good .
Justice Clement , let me intreat you , Sir .
What ?
a thread-bare Rascal ! a Beggar ! a Slave ,
that never drunk out of better than Piss-pot Mettle in
his life ! and he to deprave and abuse the vertue of an
Herb so generally receiv 'd in the Courts of Princes , the
Chambers of Nobles , the Bowers of sweet Ladies , the
Cabbins of Soldiers ! Roger , away with him , by God 's
precious ? ?
I say , go too .
Dear Master Justice , let me be beaten again , I
have deserv 'd it : but not the Prison , I beseech you .
Alas poor Oliver !
Roger , make him a Warrant ( he shall not go )
I but fear the Knave .
Do not stink sweet Oliver , you shall not go , my
Master will give you a Warrant .
O , the Lord maintain his Worship , his worthy
Away , dispatch him .
How now , Master Kno'-
well , in dumps ! in dumps ?
Come , this becomes not .
Sir , would I could not feel my Cares ? ?
Your Cares are nothing ! they are like my Cap ,
soon put on , and as soon put off .
What ?
your Son is
old enough to govern himself : let him run his course ,
it 's the only way to make him a staid Man .
If he
were an Unthrift , a Ruffian , a Drunkard , or a Licenti-
ous liver , then you had reason ; you had reason to take
Care : but , being none of these , Mirth 's my witness , an'
I had twice so many cares as you have , I'ld drown
them all in a Cup of Sack .
Come , come , let 's try it :
I muse your parcel of a Soldier returns not all this
the end .
Alas , Brother , what would you have me to do ?
I cannot help it : you see my Brother brings 'em in
here ; they are his Friends .
His Friends ?
his Fiends .
' Slud , they do nothing
but haunt him up and down , like a sort of unlucky
Sprites , and tempt him to all manner of villany that
can be thought of .
Well , by this Light , a little thing
would make me play the Devil with some of 'em ; and
'twere not more for your Husband 's sake , than any
thing else , I 'd make the House too hot for the best on
'em : they should say , and swear , Hell were broken
loose , e 'er they went hence .
But , by God 's will , 'tis no
Bodies fault but yours : for , an' you had done as you
might have done , they should have been parboil 'd and
bak 'd too , every Mothers Son , e 'er they should ha' come
in e 'er a one of 'em .
God 's my life ! did you ever hear the like ?
what a strange Man is this ! Could I keep out all them ,
think you ?
I should put my self against half a dozen
Men ?
should I ?
Good faith youl 'd mad the patient 'st
Body in the World , to hear you talk so , without any
sense or reason !
Kno'well , Bobadil , Brain-worm ,
SErvant ( in troth ) you are too prodigal
Of your wits treasure , thus to poure it forth ,
Upon so mean a subject as my worth .
You say well , Mistris , and I mean as well .
Hoy-day , here is stuff !
O , now stand close : pray Heaven , she can get
him to read : He should do it of his own natural im -
Servant , what is this same , I pray you ?
Marry , an Elegy , an Elegy , an odd toy ? ? ?
To mock an Ape withall .
O , I could sew up
his Mouth , now .
Sister , I pray you let 's hear it .
Are you Rhime-given too ?
Mistris , I 'll read it , if you please .
Pray you do , Servant .
O , here 's no foppery ! Death , I can indure the
Stocks better .
What ails thy Brother ?
can he not hold his
Water at reading of a Ballad ?
O , no : a Rhime to him is worse than Cheese , or
a Bag-pipe .
But mark , you lose the protestation .
Faith , I did it in a humour ; I know not how
it is : but , please you come near , Sir . This Gentleman
has judgment , he knows how to censure of a ?
pray
you , Sir , you can judge .
Not I , Sir : upon my Reputation , and by the
Foot of Pharaoh .
O , chide your Cousin for swearing .
Not I , so long as he do 's not forswear himself .
Master Matthew , you abuse the expectation of
your dear Mistris and her fair Sister : Fie , while you
live avoid this prolixity .
I shall , Sir : well , Incipere dulce .
How ! Insipere dulce ?
a sweet thing to be a Fool ,
What , do you take Insipere in that sense ?
You do not ?
you ! This was your Villany , to
gull him with a motte .
O , the Benchers Phrase : Pauca verba , pauca verba .
Rare Creature , let me speak without offence ,
Would God my rude words had the influence ,
To rule thy thoughts , as thy fair looks do mine ,
Then should 'st thou be his Prisoner , who is thine .
This is in Hero and Leander .
O , I peace , we shall have more of this .
Be not unkind , and fair ; mishapen stuff
Is of behaviour boysterous and rough .
How like you that , Sir ?
' Slight , he shakes his Head like a Bottle , to
feel and there by any Brain in it !
But observe the Catastrophe , now :
And I in duty will exceed all other ,
As you in Beauty do excel Loves Mother .
Well , I 'll have him free of the Wit-brokers ,
for he utters nothing but stol 'n Remnants .
O , forgive it him .
A filching Rogue , hang him .
And from the
dead ?
it 's worse than Sacriledge .
Sister , what ha' you here ?
Verses ?
pray you let 's
see : Who made these Verses ?
they are excellent good !
O , Master Well-bred , 'tis your disposition to say
so , Sir . They were good i'the Morning ; I made 'em ,
ex tempore , this Morning .
How ?
ex tempore ?
I , would I might be hang 'd else : ask Captain
Bobadill : He saw me write them , at the ?
( Pox on it )
the Star , yonder .
Can he find in his heart to curse the Stars so ?
Faith , his are even with him : they ha' curst
him enough already .
Cousin , how do you like this Gentleman 's
Verses ?
O , admirable ! the best that ever I heard ,
Couz !
Body o ' C?sar , they are admirable !
The best that ever I heard , as I am a Soldier .
I am vext , I can hold ne 'er a Bone of me still !
Heart , I think they mean to build and breed here !
Sister , you have a simple Servant here , that
crowns your Beauty with such Encomions and devices :
you may see , what it is to be the Mistris of a Wit ! that
can make your perfections so transparent , that every
blear Eye may look through them , and see him drown 'd
over Head and Ears in the deep Well of desire .
Sister
Kitely , I marvel you get you not a Servant that can
Rhime , and do Tricks too .
Oh Monster ! impudence it self ! Tricks ?
Tricks , Brother ?
what Tricks ?
Nay , speak , I pray you , what Tricks ?
I never spare any Body here : but say , what
Tricks ?
Passion of my Heart ! do Tricks ?
' Slight , here 's a Trick vied and revied ! why , you
Munkies you , what a Catter-waling do you keep ?
ha 's
he not given you Rhimes , and Verses , and Tricks ?
O , the Fiend !
Nay , you Lamp of Virginity , that take it in
snuff so ! come and cherish this tame Poetical Fury , in
your Servant , you 'll be begg 'd else shortly for a conceal-
ment : go to , reward his Muse .
You cannot give him
less than a Shilling in Conscience , for the Book he had
it out of cost him a Teston at least .
How now , Gal-
lants ?
Mr. Matthew ?
Captain ?
What , all Sons of si-
lence ?
no spirit ?
Come , you might practice your Ruffian tricks
somewhere else , and not here , I wuss : this is no Tavern
nor drinking-School , to vent your exploits in .
How now ! whose Cow has calv 'd ?
Marry , that has mine , Sir , Nay , Boy , never
look askance at me for the matter ; I 'll tell you of it , I ,
Sir , you and your Companions mend yourselves when
I ha' done ?
My Companions ?
Yes , Sir , your Companions , so I say , I am not
afraid of you , nor them neither : your hang-byes here .
You must have your Poets and your Potlings , your Sol-
dado 's and Foolado 's to follow you up and down the City ,
and here they must come to domineer and swagger .
Sirrah , you Ballad-singer , and Slops your fellow there ,
get you out , get you home ; or ( by this Steel ) I 'll cut
off your Ears , and that presently .
' Slight , stay , let 's see what he dare do : cut off
his Ears ! cut a Whetston .
You are an Ass , do you see ?
touch any Man here , and by this Hand , I 'll run my Ra -
pier to the Hilts in you .
Yea that would I fain see , Boy .
O Jesu ! murder .
Thomas Gasper !
Help , help , Thomas .
make out to part them .
Gentlemen forbear , I pray you .
Well , Sirrah , you Holofernes : by my Hand , I will
pink your Flesh full of holes with my Rapier for this ;
I will by this good Heaven : Nay , let him come , let
him come , Gentlemen , by the Body of St .
George I 'll not
kill him .
Hold , hold , good Gentlemen .
You whorson , bragging Coystril !
WHY , how now ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's the
stir here ?
Whence springs the quarrel , Thomas ?
where is he ?
Put up your Weapons , and put off this rage :
My Wife and Sister , they are cause of this .
What , Thomas ?
where is this Knave ?
Here , Sir .
Come , let 's go : this is one of my Brothers an-
cient humours , this .
I am glad , no Body was hurt by his ancient hu-
Why , how now , Brother , who enforc 'd this
brawl ?
A sort of lewd rake-hells , that care neither for
God nor the Devil ! And they must come here to read
Ballads , and Roguery , and Trash ! I 'll mar the knot of
'em e 'er I sleep perhaps : especially Bob , there : he that 's
all manner of shapes ! and Songs and Sonnets , his Fellow .
Brother , indeed , you are too violent ,
Too sudden in your humour : and you know
My Brother Well-breds temper will not bear
Any reproof , chiefly in such a presence ,
Where every slight disgrace , he should receive ,
Might wound him in opinion , and respect .
Respect ?
what talk you of respect 'mong such ,
As ha' no spark of Manhood , nor good Manners ?
'Sdeins , I am asham 'd to hear you ! respect ?
Yes , there was one a civil Gentleman ,
And very worthily demean 'd himself !
O , that was some Love of yours , Sister !
A Love of mine ?
I would it were no worse ,
Brother ,
Youl 'd pay my Portion sooner than you think for .
Indeed , he seem 'd to be a Gentleman of an
exceeding fair disposition , and of very excellent good
parts !
Her Love , by Heaven ! my Wives minion !
Fair disposition ?
excellent good parts ?
Death , these Phrases are intollerable !
Good parts ?
how should she know his parts ?
His
His parts ?
Well , well , well , well , well , well !
It is too plain , too cleer : Thomas , come hither .
What , are they gone ?
I , Sir , they went in .
My Mistris , and your Sister ? ? ?
Are any of the Gallants within ?
No, Sir , they are all gone .
Art thou sure of it ?
I can assure you , Sir .
What Gentleman was that they prais 'd so , Tho-
mas ?
One , they call him Master Kno'well , a handsom
young Gentleman , Sir .
I , I thought so : my mind gave me as much :
I 'll die , but they have hid him i'the House .
Somewhere ; I 'll go and search : go with me , Thomas .
Be true to me , and thou shalt find me a Master .
How now , what Cuckold is that knocks
so hard ?
O , Husband , is't you ?
what 's the news ?
Nay you have stun 'd me , i'faith ! you ha' giv'n
me a knock o ' the Forehead will stick by me ! Cuckold ?
' Slid , Cuckold ?
Away you Fool , did I know it was you that
knockt ?
Come , come , you may call me as bad when you list .
May I ?
Tib , you are a Whore .
You lye in your Throat , Husband .
How , the lye ?
and in my Throat too ?
do you
long to be stab 'd , ha ?
Why , you are no Soldier , I hope ?
O , must you be stab 'd by a Soldier ?
Mass , that 's
true ! when was Bobadill here ?
your Captain ?
that
Rogue , that foist , that fencing Burgullian ?
I 'll tickle him ,
Why , what 's the matter ?
trow ?
O , he has basted me rarely , sumptuously ! but I
have it here in black and white ; for his black and
blue shall pay him .
O , the Justice ! the honest old
brave Trojan in London ! I do honour the very Flea of his
A Plague on him though , he put me once in a
villanous filthy fear ; marry , it vanisht away like the smoke
of Tabacco ; but I was smok 'd soundly first .
I thank the
Devil , and his good Angel , my guest .
Well , Wife , or
Tib ( which you will ) get you in , and lock the Door , I
charge you let no Body in to you ; Wife , no Body in to
you : those are my words .
Not Captain Bob himself , nor
the Fiend in his likeness ; you are a Woman , you have
Flesh and Blood enough in you to be tempted : there -
fore keep the Door shut upon all comers .
I warrant you , there shall no Body enter here
without my consent .
Nor with your consent , sweet Tib , and so I leave
It 's more than you know , whether you leave
me so .
How ?
Why , sweet .
Tut , sweet or sowr , thou art a Flower .
Keep close thy Door , I ask no more .
And thou makest a purchase of my Love for ever .
I'faith , now let thy spirits use their best faculties .
But , at any hand , remember the message to my Brother :
for there 's no other means to start him .
I warrant you , Sir , fear nothing : I have a nim -
ble Soul has wak't all forces of Phat 'sie by this time ;
and put 'em in true motion .
What you have possest
me withall , I 'll discharge it amply , Sir : make it no que -
Forth , and prosper , Brain-worm .
Faith , Ned ,
how dost thou approve of my abilities in this de-
vice ?
Troth , well , howsoever : but , it will come ex -
cellent , if it take .
Take , Man ?
why it cannot chuse but take , if the
circumstances miscarry not : but , tell me ingenuously ,
dost thou affect my Sister Bridget as thou pretend 'st ?
Friend , am I worth belief ?
Come , do not protest .
In faith , she is a Maid
of good ornament , and much modesty : and , except
I conceiv 'd very worthily of her , thou shouldst not
have her .
Nay , that I am afraid will be a question yet ,
whether I shall have her , or no ?
' Slid , thou shalt have her ; by this Light thou
Nay , do not swear .
By this Hand thou shalt have her : I 'll go fetch
her presently .
Point but where to meet , and as I am
an honest Man I 'll bring her .
Hold , hold , be temperate .
Why , by ? ?
what shall I swear by ?
thou shalt
have her , as I am ? ? ?
Pray thee , be at peace , I am satisfied : and do
believe thou wilt omit no offered occasion to make my
desires compleat .
Thou shalt see , and know , I will not .
I , a Knave , I took him begging o ' the
way ,
This morning , as I came over Moor-fields !
O , here he is ! yo ' have made fair speed , believe me :
Where , i' the name of sloth , could you be thus ?
Marry , peace by my comfort , where I thought
I should have had little comfort of your Worships
How so ?
O , Sir , your coming to the City , your enter-
tainment of me , and your sending me to watch ? ? ?
indeed , all the circumstances either of your Charge , or
my Imployment are as open to your Son , as to your self .
How should that be , unless that Villain , Brain-
worm ,
Have told him of the Letter , and discover 'd
All that I strictly charg 'd him to conceal ?
'tis so !
I am partly , o ' the faith 'tis so indeed .
But , how should he know thee to be my Man ?
Nay , Sir , I cannot tell ; unless it be by the
black Art ! is not your Son a Scholar , Sir ?
Yes , but I hope his Soul is not allied
Unto such Hellish practice : if it were ,
I had just cause to weep my part in him ,
And curse the time of his Creation .
But , where didst thou find them , Fitz-Sword ?
You should rather ask where they found me ,
Sir ; for , I 'll be sworn , I was going along in the Street ,
thinking nothing , when ( of a suddain ) a Voice calls
Mr. Knowell 's Man ; another cries , Soldier : and thus half
a dozen of 'em , till they had call 'd me within a House ,
where I no sooner came , but they seem 'd Men , and out
flew all their Rapiers at my Bosom , with some three or
fourscore Oaths to accompany 'em ; and all to tell me ,
I was a dead Man , if I did not confess where you
D were ,
were , and how I was imployed , and about what ;
which , when they could not get out of me ( as I pro-
test , they must ha' dissected , and made an Anatomy o '
me first , and so I told 'em ) they lockt me up into a
Room i' the top of a high House , whence by great
Miracle ( having a light Heart ) I slid down by a bottom
of Packthred into the Street , and so scapt .
But , Sir ,
thus much I can assure you , for I heard it while I was
lockt up , there were a great many Rich Merchants and
brave Citizens Wives with 'em at a Feast : and your
Son , Mr. Edward , withdrew with one of 'em , and has
pointed to meet her anon at one Cobs House a Water-
bearer , that dwells by the Wall .
Now , there your
Worship shall be sure to take him , for there he Preys ,
and fail he will not .
Nor will I fail to break his match I doubt
Go thou along with Justice Clements Man ,
And stay there for me .
At one Cobs House sayst thou ?
I Sir , there you shall have him .
Yes ?
invisi-
ble ?
Much Wench , or much Son ! ' Slight , when he has
staid there three or four Houres , travelling with the
expectation of Wonders , and at length be deliver 'd of
Air : O , the sport that I should then take , to look on
him if I durst ! But now I mean to appear no more a -
fore him in this shape .
I have another trick to act yet .
O that I were so happy as to light on a nupson now of
this Justices Novice .
Sir , I make you stay somewhat
Not a whit , Sir . Pray you what do you mean ,
Sir ?
I was putting up some Papers ? ? ?
You ha' been lately in the Wars , Sir , it seems .
Marry have I , Sir , to my loss ; and expence of
all almost ? ?
Troth Sir , I would be glad to bestow a Pottle
of Wine o ' you , if it please you to accept it ? ?
O , Sir ? ? ?
But to hear the manner of your Services , and
your Devices in the Wars , they say they be very strange ,
and not like those a Man reads in the Roman Histories , or
sees at Mile-end .
No I assure you , Sir ; why at any time when
it please you , I shall be ready to discourse to you all I
know : and more too somewhat .
No better time than now , Sir ; we 'll go to the
Wind-mill : there we shall have a Cup of neat Grist ,
we call it .
I pray you , Sir , let me request you to the
I 'll follow you , Sir , and make Grist of you , if
I have good luck .
where we were to day , Mr. Well-bred 's half Brother ?
I think the whole Earth cannot shew his Parallel by this
We were now speaking of him : Captain
Bobadill tells me he is fallen foul o ' you too .
O , I Sir , he threatned me with the Bastinado .
I , but I think , I taught you prevention this
Morning , for that ? ?
You shall kill him beyond que -
stion : if you be so generously minded .
Indeed , it is a most excellent Trick !
O , you do not give spirit enough to your motion ,
you are too tardy , too heavy ! O , it must be done like
lightning , hay ?
Rare Captain !
Tut , 'tis nothing , an't be not done in a ?
punto!
Captain , did you ever prove your self upon a -
ny of our Masters of defence here ?
O good Sir ! yes I hope he has .
I will tell you , Sir . Upon my first coming to the
City , after my long travail , for knowledg ( in that mi-
stery only ) there came three or four of 'em to me , at
a Gentlemans House , where it was my chance to be re -
sident at that time , to intreat my Presence at their
Schools ; and withal so much importun 'd me , that ( I
protest to you , as I am a Gentleman ) I was asham 'd
of their rude demeanour out of all measure : well , I
told 'em that to come to a publick School , they should
pardon me , it was opposite ( in diameter ) to my Hu-
mour ; but , if so be they would give their attendance
at my lodging , I protested to do them what right or
favour I could , as I was a Gentleman , and so forth .
So , Sir , then you tryed their skill ?
Alas , soon tryed ! you shall hear Sir . Within
two or three days after they came ; and , by honestly ,
fair Sir , believe me , I grac 'd them exceedingly , shew 'd
them some two or three tricks of prevention , have pur-
chas 'd 'em since a Credit to admiration ! they cannot
deny this : and yet now they hate me , and why ?
be-
cause I am excellent , and for no other vile Reason on
the Earth .
This is strange and barbarous ! as ever I heard .
Nay , for a more instance of their preposterous
natures ; but note , Sir . They have assaulted me some
three , four , five , six of them together , as I have walkt
alone in divers Skirts i' the Town , as Turn-bull , White -
chappel , Shore-ditch , which were then my Quarters ; and
since , upon the Exchange , at my Lodging , and at my
Ordinary : where I have driven them afore me the
whole length of a Street , in the open view of all our
Gallants , pitying to hurt them , believe me .
Yet all this
Lenity will not o 're-come their Spleen ; they will be
doing with the Pismier , raising a Hill a Man may spurn
abroad with his Foot at pleasure .
By my self I could
have slain them all , but I delight not in Murder .
I am
loth to bear any other than this Bastinado for 'em : yet
I hold it good polity not to go disarm 'd , for though I
be skilful , I may be oppress 'd with Multitudes .
I , believe me , my you Sir : and ( in my
conceit ) our whole Nation should sustain the loss by it ,
if it were so .
Alas no : what 's a peculiar Man to a Nation ?
not seen .
O , but your skill , Sir .
Indeed , that might be some loss ; but who re -
spects it ?
I will tell you , Sir , by the way of private ,
and under Seal ; I am a Gentleman , and live here ob -
scure , and to my self ; but , were I known to Her Ma -
jesty and the Lords ( observe me ) I would undertake
(upon this poor Head and Life ) for the publick benefit
of the State , not only to spare the intire Lives of her
Subjects in general , but to save the one half ; nay , three
parts of her yearly charge in holding War , and against
what Enemy soever .
And how would I do it think you ?
Nay , I know not , nor can I conceive .
Why thus , Sir . I would select Nineteen more ,
to my self throughout the Land ; Gentlemen they
should be of good Spirit , strong and able Constitution , I
would choose them by an instinct , a Character that I
have : and I would teach these Nineteen the special
Rules , as your Punto , your Reverso , your Stoccata , your
Imbroccata , your Passada , your Montanto ; till they could
all play very near , or altogether as well as my self .
This
done , say the Enemy were Forty thousand strong , we
Twenty would come into the Field the Tenth of March ,
or thereabouts ; and we would challenge Twenty of the
Enemy ; they could not in their Honour refuse us ; well
we would kill them ; challenge Twenty more , kill them ;
Twenty more , kill them ; Twenty more , kill them
too ; and thus would we kill every Man his Twenty a
day , that 's Twenty score ; Twenty score , that 's Two
hundred ; Two hundred a day , five days a thousand ;
Forty
Forty thousand ; Forty times five , Five times forty , Two
hundred days kills them all up by Computation .
And
this will I venture my poor Gentleman-like Carcass to
perform ( provided there be no Treason practis 'd upon
us ) by fair and discreet Manhood ; that is , civilly by
the Sword .
Why are you so sure of your hand Captain at
all times ?
Tut , never miss thrust upon my Reputation
with you .
I would not stand in Down-rights state then ,
an' you meet him , for the Wealth of any one Street in
Why , Sir , you mistake me ! if he were here
now , by this welkin , I would not draw my Weapon
on him ! let this Gentleman do his mind : but I will
bastinado him ( by the bright Sun ) where ever I
meet him .
Faith , and I 'll have a fling at him at my distance .
Gods so , look where he is ; yonder he goes .
What peevish luck have I , I cannot meet with
these bragging Raskals ?
It 's not he ?
is it ?
Yes faith , it is he ?
I 'll be hang 'd then if that were he .
Sir , keep your hanging good for some greater
matter , for I assure you that was he .
Upon my Reputation it was he .
Had I thought it had been he , he must not have
gone so : but I can hardly be induc 'd to believe it was he
That I think , Sir . But see , he is come a -
gain !
O , Pharoahs foot have I found you ?
Come ,
draw to your Tools ; draw Gipsie , or I 'll thresh you .
Gentleman of valour , I do believe in thee , hear
me ? ? ?
Draw your Weapon then .
Tall Man , I never thought on it till now ( body
of me ) I had a Warrant of the Peace served on me ,
even now as I came along , by a Water-bearer ; this
Gentleman saw it , Mr. Matthew .
'Sdeath , you will not draw then ?
Hold , hold , under thy favour forbear .
Prate again , as you like this , you Whoreson
foist you .
You 'll controul the Point , you ?
Your Con-
sort is gone ?
had he staid he had shar 'd with you , Sir .
Well Gentlemen , bear Witness , I was bound to
the Peace , by this good day .
No faith , it 's an ill day Captain , never reckon
it other : but , say you were bound to the Peace , the
Law allows you to defend your self : that 'll prove but a
poor excuse .
I cannot tell , Sir . I desire good construction in
fair sort .
I never sustain 'd the like disgrace ( by Hea -
ven ) sure I was struck with a Plannet thence , for I had
no power to touch my Weapon .
I , like enough , I have heard of many that
have been beaten under a Plannet : go , get you to a
' Slid , an' these be your Tricks , your passa -
does , and your mountantoes , I 'll none of them .
O , man-
ners ! that this Age should bring forth such Creatures !
that Nature should be at leisure to make 'em ! Come
Mass I 'll ha' this Cloke .
Gods will , 'tis Down-rights .
Nay , it 's mine now , another might have tane 't
up as well as I , I 'll wear it , so I will .
E , Kn .
How an' he see it ?
he 'll challenge it , assure
your self .
I , but he shall not ha' it ; I 'll say I bought it .
Take heed you buy it not too dear Couz .
T' incense his Anger , and disturb the Peace
Of my poor House , where there are Sentinels ,
That every Minute watch to give Alarms ,
Of Civil War , without adjection
Of your assistance or occasion .
No harm done , Brother , I warrant you : since
there is no harm done .
Anger costs a Man nothing :
and a tall Man is never his own Man till he be angry .
To keep his Valour in obscurity , is to keep himself as
it were in a Cloke-bag .
What 's a Musician unless he
play ?
What 's a tall Man unless he fight ?
For indeed all
this my wise Brother stands upon absolutly ; and that
made me fall in with him so resolutely .
I , but what harm might have come of it , Brother ?
Might , Sister ?
so might the good warm Clothes
your Husband wears be poyson 'd , for any thing he
knows ; or the wholesom Wine he drunk , even now ,
at the Table ? ?
Now , God forbid : O me .
Now I remember
My Wife drunk to me last ; and chang 'd the Cup ,
And bade me wear this cursed Sute to day .
See , if heav'n suffer murder undiscovered !
I feell me ill ; give me some Mithridate ,
Some Mithridate and Oyl , good Sister , fetch me ;
O , I am sick at heart ! I burn , I burn .
If you will save my Life , go , fetch it me .
O strange humour ! my very breath has poyson 'd
Good Brother be content , what do you mean ?
The strength of these extream Conceits will kill you .
Beshrew your Heart blood , Brother Well-bred ,
now , for putting such a toy into his Head .
Is a fit simile a Toy ?
will he be poyson 'd with a
simile ?
Brother Kitely , what a strange and idle imagina -
tion is this ?
For shame , be wiser .
O my Soul there 's
no such matter .
Kite , Am I not sick ?
how am I then , not poyson 'd ?
Am I not poyson 'd ?
how am I then , so sick ?
If you be sick , your own thoughts make you sick .
His Jealousie is the Poyson he has taken .
Mr. Kitely , my Master Justice Clement salutes you ;
and desires to speak with you with all possible speed .
No time but now ?
when I think I am sick ?
ve-
ry sick ! well , I will wait upon his Worship .
Thomas , Cob ,
I must seek them out , and set 'em Sentinels till I return .
Thomas , Cob , Thomas .
This is perfectly rare , Brain-worm ! but how got 'st
thou this Apparel of the Justices Man ?
Marry Sir , my proper fine Pen-man , would
needs bestow the Grist o ' me , at the Wind-mil , to hear
some martial Discourse ; where so I marshal 'd him , that
I made him drunk with Admiration ! and , because too
much heat was the cause of his Distemper , I stript him
stark naked , as he lay along asleep , and borrowed his
Sute to deliver this Counterfeit Message in , leaving a
rusty Armour , and an old brown Bill to watch him till
my return ; which shall be , when I ha' paw n 'd his Ap -
parel , and spent the better part o ' the Money , perhaps .
Well , thou art a successful merry Knave , Brain-
worm , his absence will be a good subject for more mirth .
I pray thee , return to thy young Master , and will him to
meet me and my Sister Bridget at the Tower instantly ;
for , here tell him the House is so stor 'd with Jealousie ,
there is no room for Love to stand upright in .
We must
get our fortunes committed to some larger Prison , say ; and
then the Tower , I know no better Air : nor where the Li-
berty of the House may do us more present service .
D 2 Kite .
Come hither , Thomas .
Now , my secret 's ripe ,
And thou shalt have it : lay to both thine Ears .
Hark , what I say to thee .
I must go forth , Thomas ,
Be careful of thy promise , keep good watch ,
Note every Gallant , and observe him well ,
That enters in my absence to thy Mistress :
If he would shew him Rooms , the Jest is stale ,
Follow 'em , Thomas , or else hang on him ,
And let him not go after ; mark their Looks ;
Note if she offer but to see his Hand ,
Or any other amorous Toy about him ;
But praise his Leg , or Foot ; or if she say
The day is hot , and bid him feel her hand ,
How hot it is ; O , that 's a monstrous thing !
Note me all this , good Thomas , mark their Sighs ,
And , if they do but whisper , break 'em off :
I 'll bear thee out in it .
Wilt thou do this ?
Wilt thou be true , my Thomas ?
As truth 's self , Sir .
Why , I believe thee ; where is Cob , now ?
Cob ?
He 's ever calling for Cob ! I wonder how he im -
ploys Cob so !
Indeed Sister , to ask how he imploys Cob , is a
necessary question , for you that are his Wife , and a thing
not very easie for you to be satisfied in ; but this I 'll as-
sure you , Cobs Wife is an excellent Bawd , Sister , and
oftentimes , your Husband hants her House ; marry , to
what end ; I cannot altogether accuse him , imagine
you what you think convenient .
But I have known
fair Hides have foul Hearts , e 're now , Sister .
Never said you truer than that , Brother , so
much I can tell you for your learning .
Thomas , fetch
your Cloke and go with me , I 'll after him presently : I
would to fortune I could take him there , i' faith , I 'd re -
turn him his own , I warrant him .
So let 'em go : this may make sport anon .
Now ,
my fair Sister-in-law , that you knew but how happy a
thing it were to be Fair and Beautiful ?
That touches not me Brother .
That 's true ; that 's even the fault of it : for in-
deed , Beauty stands a Woman in no stead , unless it pro-
cure her touching .
But , Sister , whether it touch you
or no , it touches your Beauties ; and I am sure , they
will abide the touch ; an' they do not , a Plague of all
Ceruse , say I ; and it touches me too in part , though
not in the ?
Well , there 's a dear and respected Friend
of mine , Sister , stands very strongly and worthily af -
fected toward you , and hath vow 'd to inflame whole
Bone-fires of zeal at his Heart in Honour of your Per-
I have already engag 'd my promise to bring
you , where you shall hear him confirm much more .
Ned Kno'wel is the Man , Sister .
There 's no exception
against the Party .
you are ripe for a Husband ; and a
Minutes loss to such an occasion , is a great trespass in a
wise Beauty .
What say you , Sister ?
On my Soul he
loves you , Will you give him the meeting ?
Faith I had very little confidence in mine own
constancy , Brother , if I durst not meet a Man : but
this motion of yours , favours of an old Knight-adven-
turers Servant , a little too much methinks .
What 's that , Sister ?
Marry of the Squire .
No matter if it did , I would be such an one for
my Friend , but see ! who is return 'd to hinder us ?
What villany is this ?
call 'd out on a false Message ?
This was some Plot ! I was not sent for .
Bridget ,
Where 's your Sister ?
I think she be gone forth , Sir .
Kite How ! is my Wife gone forth ?
whither for Gods sake ?
She 's gone abroad with Thomas .
Abroad with Thomas ?
oh , that villain dors me .
He hath discover 'd all unto my Wife !
Beast that I was to trust him ; whither , I pray you , went
she ?
I know not , Sir .
I 'll tell you , Brother , wither I suspect she 's gone .
Whither , good Brother ?
To Cobs House , I believe : but , keep my Counsel .
I will , I will : to Cobs House ?
doth she hant
Cobs ?
She 's gone a purpose now to Cuckold me ,
With that lewd Raskal , who , to win her favour ,
Hath told her all .
Come , he 's once more gone ,
Sister , let 's lose no time ; th ' Affair is worth it .
way ?
ha ?
Why , what should they say ?
but as of a discreet
Gentleman ?
quick , wary , respectful of Natures fair Li-
neaments ; and that 's all ?
Why so ! but what can they say of your beating ?
A rude part , a touch with soft Wood , a kind of
gross Battery us 'd , laid on strongly , born most patient-
ly ; and that 's all .
I , but would any Man have offered it in Venice ?
as you say ?
Tut , I assure you , no : you shall have there your
Nobilis , your Gentelezza , come in bravely upon your
reverse , stand you close , stand you firm , stand you fair ,
save your retricato with his left Leg , come to the assalto
with the right , thrust with brave Steel , defie your base
Wood ! But wherefore do I awake this remembrance ?
Iwas fascinated by Jupiter : fascinated ; but I will be un-
witch 'd , and reveng 'd by Law .
Do you hear ?
is't not best to get a Warrant , and
have him arrested and brought before Justice Clement ?
It were not amiss , would we had it .
Why , here comes his Man , let 's speak to him .
Agreed , do you speak .
' Save you , Sir . Brai .
With all my heart , Sir .
Sir , there is one Down-right hath abus 'd this Gen-
tleman and my self , and we determine to make our a -
mends by Law ; now , if you would do us the favour
to procure a Warrant , to bring him afore your Master ,
you shall be well consider 'd , I assure you , Sir .
Sir , you know my Service is my Living ; such
Favours as these gotten of my Master is his only Pre -
ferment , and therefore you must consider me as I may
make benefit of my Place .
How is that ?
Faith , Sir , the thing is extraordinary , and the
Gentleman may be of great accompt ; yet , be what
he will , if you will lay me down a brace of Angels in
my hand , you shall have it , otherwise not .
How shall we do Captain ?
he asks a brace of
Angels , you have no Money ?
Not a Cross , by Fortune .
Nor I , as I am a Gentleman , but two Pence
left of my two Shillings in the Morning for Wine and
Raddish : let 's find him some Pawn .
Pawn ?
we have none to the value of his demand .
O , yes .
I 'll pawn this Jewel in my Ear , and you
may pawn your Silk-stockings , and pull up your Boots ,
they will ne 're be mist : It must be done now .
Well , an' there be no remedy : I 'll step aside and
pull 'em off .
Do you hear , Sir ?
we have no store of Money
at this time , but you shall have good Pawns : look you ,
Sir , this Jewel , and that Gentlemans Silk-stockings , be-
cause we would have it dispatch't e 're we went to our
I am content , Sir ; I will get you the Warrant
presently , what 's his Name , say you ?
Down right ?
I , I , George Down-right .
What manner of Man is he ?
A tall big Man , Sir ; he goes in a Cloke most
commonly , of Silk-Russet , laid about with Russet Lace .
' Tis very good , Sir .
Here , Sir , here 's my Jewel .
And here are Stockins .
Well , Gentlemen , I 'll procure you this Warrant
presently ; but who will you have to serve it ?
That 's true , Captain , that must be consider 'd .
Body o ' me , I know not ; 'tis Service of danger .
Why , you were best get one o ' the Varlets o ' the
City , a Serjeant : I 'll appoint you one , if you please .
Will you , Sir ?
Why , we can wish no better .
We 'll leave it to you , Sir .
This is rare ! Now will I go pawn this Cloke
of the Justice 's Mans at the Brokers , for a Varlets Sute ,
and be the Varlet my self ; and get either more Pawns ,
or more Money of Down-right , for the Arrest .
Ho ?
who is within here ?
I am within , Sir ; what 's your pleasure ?
To know who is within besides your self .
Why , Sir , you are no Constable , I hope ?
O ! fear you the Constable ?
then I doubt not ,
You have some Guests within deserve that fear ;
I 'll fetch him straight .
O' Gods Name , Sir .
Go to .
Come , tell me , Is not young Kno'well
here ?
Young Kno'well ?
I know none such , Sir , o ' mine
Your Honesty ! Dame , it flies too lightly from
There is no way but fetch the Constable .
The Constable ! The Man is mad , I think .
Ho , who keeps House here ?
O , this is the Female Copesmate of my Son .
Now shall I meet him straight .
Knock , Thomas ,
Ho , good Wife ?
Why , what 's the matter
with you ?
Why Woman , grieves it you to ope your Door ?
Belike you get something to keep it shut .
What mean these Questions , 'pray ye ?
So strange you make it ?
Is not my Husband
here ?
Her Husband !
My tried Husband , Master Kitely .
I hope he needs not to be tried here .
No, Dame , he do 's it not for need , but pleasure .
Neither for need nor pleasure is he here .
This is but a Device to baulk me withal .
Soft , who is this ?
' Tis not my Son disguis 'd ?
O , Sir , have I forestall 'd your honest Market ,
Found your close Walks ?
You stand amaz 'd now , do you ?
I ' faith ( I am glad ) I have smoakt you at last .
What is your Jewel , trow ?
In , come , let 's see her ;
( Fetch forth your Houswife , Dame ) if she be fairer ,
In any honest Judgment , than my self ,
I 'll be content with it : But , she is Change ,
She feeds you fat , she sooths your Appetite ,
And you are well ! Your Wife , an honest Woman ,
Is Meat twice sod to you , Sir ! O , you Treacher !
She cannot counterfeit thus palpably .
Out on thy more than Strumpet Impudence !
Steal 'st thou thus to thy Haunts ?
and have I taken
Thy Bawd , and thee , and thy Companion ,
This hoary-headed Letcher , this old Goat ,
Close at your Villany , and would 'st thou 'scuse it
With this stale Harlot 's Jest , accusing me?
O , old Incontinent , dost not thou shame ,
When all thy Powers in Chastity is spent ,
To have a Mind so hot , and to entice ,
And feed th ' Enticements of a lustful Woman ?
Out , I defie thee , I , dissembling Wretch .
Defie me , Strumpet ?
Ask thy Pandar here
Can he deny it ?
or that wicked Elder ?
Why , hear you , Sir . Kit .
Tut , tut , tut ; never speak .
Thy guilty Conscience will discover thee .
What Lunacy is this , that haunts this Man ?
Well , Goodwife Ba 'd , Cob 's Wife , and you ,
That make your Husband such a Hoddy doddy ;
And you , young Apple squire , and old Cuckold-maker ;
I 'll ha' you every one before a Justice :
Nay , you shall answer it , I charge you go .
Marry , with all my Heart , Sir , I go willingly ;
Though I do taste this as a Trick put on me ,
To punish my impertinent Search , and justly ,
And half forgive my Son for the Device .
Come , will you go ?
Go ?
to thy shame , believe it .
Why , what 's the matter here ?
what 's here to do ?
O , Cob , art thou come ?
I have been abus 'd ,
And i' thy House : Never was Man so wrong 'd !
' Slid , in my House ?
my Master Kitely ?
Who
wrongs you in my House ?
Marry , young Lust in old , and old in young here :
Thy Wife 's their Bawd , here have I taken 'em .
How ?
Bawd ?
Is my House come to that ?
Am
I preferr 'd thither ?
Did I charge you to keep your
Doors shut , Isbel ?
and do you let 'em lie open for all
Comers ?
Friend , know some Cause , before thou beat 'st thy
Wife ,
This 's Madness in thee ?
Why ?
is there no Cause ?
Yes , I 'll shew cause before the Justice , Cob :
Come , let her go with me .
Nay , she shall go .
Nay , I will go .
I 'll see an' you may be allow 'd
to make a Bundle o ' Hemp o ' your right and lawful
Wife thus , at every Cuckoldly Knaves pleasure .
Why
do you not go ?
A bitter Quean ! Come , we 'll ha' you tam 'd .
my self , being in this Serjeants Gown .
A Man
of my present Profession never counterfeits , till he lays
hold upon a Debtor , and says , he rests him ; for then he
brings him to all manner of unrest .
A kind of little
Kings we are , bearing the Diminutive of a Mace , made
like a young Artichock , that always carries Pepper and
Salt in it self .
Well , I know not what Danger I under-
go by this Exploit ; pray Heaven I come well off .
See , I think , yonder is the Varlet , by his Gown .
Let 's go in quest of him .
' Save you , Friend ; are not you here by appoint-
ment of Justice Clement 's Man ?
Yes , an't please you , Sir ; he told me , two Gen-
tlemen had will 'd him to procure a Warrant from his
Master ( which I have about me ) to be serv 'd on one
It is honestly done of you both ; and see where
the Party comes you must arrest ; serve it upon him quick -
ly , afore he be aware ? ?
Bear back , Master Matthew .
Master Down-right , I arrest you i' the Queens
Name , and must carry you afore a Justice , by vertue of
this Warrant .
Me , Friend ?
I am no Down-right , I : I am Ma -
ster Stephen : You do not well to arrest me , I tell you
truly :
truly : I am in no bodies Bonds nor Books , I would you
should know it .
A plague on you heartily , for making
me thus afraid afore my time .
Why , now you are deceived , Gentlemen .
He wears such a Cloke , and that deceived us :
But see , here a comes indeed ; this is he , Officer .
Why , how now , Signior Gull ! are you turn 'd
Filcher of late ?
Come , deliver my Cloke .
Your Cloke , Sir ?
I bought it even now , in open
Master Down-right , I have a Warrant I must
serve upon you , procur 'd by these two Gentlemen .
These Gentlemen ?
these Rascals !
Keep the Peace , I charge you in her Majesty 's
I obey thee .
What must I do , Officer ?
Go before Master Justice Clement , to answer
what they can object against you , Sir : I will use you
kindly , Sir .
Come , let 's before , and make the Justice , Cap -
tain ? ?
The Varlet 's a tall Man , afore Heaven !
Gull , you 'll gi' me my Cloke ?
Sir , I bought it , and I 'll keep it .
You will ?
I , that I will .
Officer , there 's thy Fee , arrest him .
Master Stephen , I must arrest you .
Arrest me ! I scorn it .
There , take your Cloke ,
I 'll none on't .
Nay , that shall not serve your turn now , Sir .
Officer , I 'll go with thee to the Justices ; bring him
Why , is not here your Cloke ?
what would you
have ?
I 'll ha' you answer it , Sir .
Sir , I 'll take your Word , and this Gentleman 's
too , for his Appearance .
I 'll ha' no Words taken : Bring him along .
Sir , I may chuse to do that , I may take Bail .
' Tis true , you may take Bail , and chuse , at ano -
ther time ; but you shall not now , Varlet : Bring him
along , or I 'll swinge you .
Sir , I pity the Gentleman 's Case .
Here 's your
Money again .
'Sdeyns , tell not me of my Money ; bring him
away , I say .
I warrant you he will go with you of himself ,
Yet more ado ?
I have made a fair Mash on't .
Must I go ?
I know no remedy , Master Stephen .
Come along , afore me here ; I do not love your
hanging Look behind .
Why , Sir , I hope you cannot hang me for it .
Can he , Fellow ?
I think not , Sir : It is but a whipping matter ,
Why then let him do his worst , I am resolute .
NAy , but stay , stay , give me leave ; My Chair , Sir-
You , Master Kno'well , say you went thither
to meet your Son ?
I , Sir .
But who directed you thither ?
That did mine own Man , Sir .
Where is he ?
Nay , I know not now ; I left him with your
Clark , and appointed him to stay here for me .
My Clark ?
About what time was this ?
Marry , between one and two , as I take it .
And what time came my Man with the false
Message to you , Master Kitely ?
After two , Sir .
Very good : But , Mistris Kitely how chance
that you were at Cobs ?
ha ?
An' please you , Sir , I 'll tell you : My Brother
Well bred told me , that Cob 's House was a suspected
place ? ? ?
So it appears , methinks ; but on .
And that my Husband us 'd thither , daily .
No matter , so he us 'd himself well , Mistris .
True , Sir ; but you know what grows by such
Haunts oftentimes .
I see rank Fruits of a jealous Brain , Mistris Kite-
ly : But did you find your Husband there , in that Case
as you suspected ?
I found her there , Sir .
Did you so ?
That alters the Case .
Who gave
you knowledge of your Wifes being there ?
Marry , that did my Brother Well-bred .
How ?
Well-bred first tell her ?
then tell you af -
ter ?
Where is Well-bred ?
Gone with my Sister , Sir , I know not whither .
Why , this is a meer Trick , a Device ; you are
gull 'd in this most grossly all .
Alas , poor Wench , wert
thou beaten for this ?
Yes , most pitifully , and't please you .
And worthily , I hope , if it shall prove so .
I , that 's like , and a piece of a Sentence .
How
now , Sir ?
what 's the matter ?
Sir , there 's a Gentleman i' the Court without ,
desires to speak with your Worship .
A Gentleman ?
what 's he ?
A Soldier , Sir , he says .
A Soldier ?
Take down my Armor , my Sword ,
A Soldier speak with me !
Why , when , Knaves ?
Come on ,
come on , hold my Cap there , so ;
give me my Gorget , my Sword : Stand by , I will end
your Matters anon ?
Let the Soldier enter .
Now , Sir ,
what ha' you to say to me ?
BY your Worships favour ? ?
Nay , keep out , Sir ; I know not your Pre -
You send me word , Sir , you are a Soldier : Why ,
Sir , you shall be answer 'd here , here be them have been
amongst Soldiers .
Sir , your Pleasure .
Faith , Sir , so it is , this Gentleman and my self
have been most uncivilly wrong 'd and beaten , by one
Down-right , a course Fellow , about the Town here ; and
for my own part , I protest , being a Man in no sort given
to this filthy Humour of Quarrelling , he hath assaulted
me in the way of my Peace , despoil 'd me of mine Honor ,
disarm 'd me of my Weapons , and rudely laid me along
in the open Streets , when I not so much as once offer 'd
to resist him .
O , God 's precious ! Is this the Soldier ?
Here ,
take my Armour off quickly , 'twill make him swoon , I
fear ; he is not fit to look on't , that will put up a Blow .
An't please your Worship , he was bound to the
Why , and he were , Sir , his Hands were not
bound , were they ?
There 's one of the Varlets of the City , Sir , has
brought two Gentlemen here ; one , upon your Worships

Yes , Sir ; the Officer says , procur 'd by these
Bid
Bid him come in .
Set by this Picture .
What ,
Mr. Down-right ! are you brought at Mr. Fresh-water 's
Suit here ?
I ' Faith , Sir . And here 's another brought at my Suit .
What are you , Sir ?
A Gentleman , Sir . O , Uncle !
Uncle ! who! Master Kno'well ?
I , Sir ; this is a wise Kinsman of mine .
God 's my Witness , Uncle , I am wrong 'd here
monstrously ; he charges me with stealing of his Cloke ,
and would I might never stir , if I did not find it in the
Street by chance .
O , did you find it now ?
You said you bought
it e 're-while .
And you said , I stole it : Nay , now my Uncle
is here , I 'll do well enough with you .
Well , let this breath a while : You that have
cause to complain there , stand forth : Had you my
Warrant for this Gentleman 's Apprehension ?
I , an't please your Worship .
Nay , do not speak in passion so : Where had
you it ?
Of your Clerk , Sir .
That 's well ! an' my Clerk can make War-
rants , and my Hand not at 'em ! Where is the Warrant ?
Officer , have you it ?
No, Sir , your Worships Man , Master Formal , bid
me do it for these Gentlemen , and he would be my
Why , Master Down-right , are you such a No-
vice to be serv 'd and never see the Warrant ?
Sir , he did not serve it on me .
No ?
How then ?
Marry , Sir , he came to me , and said he must
serve it , and he would use me kindly , and so ? ? ?
O , God 's pitty , was it so , Sir ?
he must serve it ?
give me my long Sword there , and help me off .
So ,
come on , Sir Varlet , I must cut off your Legs , Sirrah :
nay , stand up , I 'll use you kindly ; I must cut off your
Legs I say .
O , good Sir , I beseech you : nay , good Master
I must do it , there is no remedy , I must cut off
your Legs , Sirrah , I must cut off your Ears , you Rascal ,
I must do it ; I must cut off your Nose , I must cut off
your Head .
O , good your Worship .
Well , rise , how doest thou do now ?
doest thou
feel they self well ?
hast thou no harm ?
No, I thank your good Worship , Sir .
Why , so ?
I said I must cut of thy Legs , and
I must cut off thy Arms , and I must cut off thy Head ;
but , I did not do it : so you said you must serve this
Gentleman with my Warrant , but you did not serve
You Knave , you Slave , you Rogue , do you say
you must ?
Sirrah , away with him , to the Goal , I 'll
teach you a Trick , for your must , Sir .
Good , Sir , I beseech you , be good to me .
Tell him he shall to the Goal , away with him ,
I say .
Nay , Sir , if you will commit me , it shall be for
committing more than this : I will not lose by my
travail , any grain of my fame , certain .
How is this ?
My Man Brain-worm .
O yes , Uncle , Brain-worm has been with my
Cousin Edward and I all this day .
I told you all , there was some device .
Nay , excellent Justice , since I have laid my
self thus open to you ; now , stand strong for me : both
with your Sword and your Ballance .
Body o ' me , a merry Knave ! Give me a Bowle
of Sack : If he belong to you , Master Kno'well , I be-
speak your patience .
That is it , I have most need of .
Sir , if you 'll
pardon me only , I 'll glory in all the rest of my ex -
Sir , you know I love not to have my favours
come hard from me .
You have your Pardon , though
I suspect you shrewdly for being of councel with my
Son against me .
Yes , faith , I have , Sir , though you retain 'd me
doubly this morning for your self : first as Brain-worm ;
after , as Fitz-Sword .
I was your reform 'd Soldier , Sir .
' Twas I sent you to Cob 's upon the Errand without
Is it possible ! or that thou should 'st disguise thy
Language so as I should not know thee ?
O , Sir , this has been the day of my metamor-
phosis ! It is not that shape alone that I have run through
to day .
I brought this Gentleman , Mr. Kitely , a mes -
sage too , in the form of Mr. Justices Man here , to
draw him out o'the way , as well as your Worship , while
Master Well-bred might make a conveiance of Mistris
Bridget to my young Master .
How ! my Sister stol 'n away ?
My Son is not married , I hope !
Faith , Sir , they are both sure as Love , a
Priest , and three thousand Pound ( which is her Por-
tion ) can make 'em ; and by this time are ready to be-
speak their Wedding Supper at the Wind-mill , except
some Friend here prevent 'em , and invite 'em home .
Marry , that will I ( I thank thee for putting
me in mind on't . )
Sirrah , go you and fetch 'em hi-
ther upon my Warrant .
Neithers Friends have cause
to be sorry , if I know the young couple aright .
Here ,
I drink to thee for thy good news .
But , I pray thee ,
what hast thou done with my Man Formall ?
Faith , Sir , after some ceremony past , as making
him drunk , first with Story , and then with Wine ( but all
in kindness ) and stripping him to his Shirt : I left him
in that cool vain departed , sold your Worships Warrant
to these two , paw n 'd his Livery for that Varlets Gown
to serve it in ; and thus have brought my self by my
activity to your Worship 's consideration .
And I will consider thee in another Cup of
Here 's to thee ; which having drunk off , this is
my sentence .
Pledge me .
Thou hast done , or assisted
to nothing , in my judgment , but deserves to be par-
do n 'd for the wit o'the offence .
If thy Master , or any
Man here be angry with thee , I shall suspect his En-
gine while I know him for't .
How now , what noise
is that ?
Sir , it is Roger is come home .
Bring him in , bring him in .
What ! drunk in
Arms against me ?
Your reason , your reason for this .
IBeseech your Worship to pardon me ; I happen 'd in-
to ill company by chance that cast me into a sleep ,
and stript me of all my Clothes ? ?
Well , tell him I am Justice Clement , and do
pardon him : but what is this to your Armour ?
what
may that signifie ?
An't please you , Sir , it hung up i' the Room ,
where I was stript ; and I borrow 'd it of one o'the
Drawers to come home in , because I was loth to do
Penance through the Street i 'my Shirt .
Well ,
Well , stand by a while .
Who be these ?
O , the
young company , welcome , welcome .
Gi' you joy .
Nay
Mistris Bridget , blush not ; you are not so fresh a Bride ,
but the news of it is come hither afore you .
Master
Bridegroom , I ha' made your peace , give me your
hand : so will I for all the rest , e 'er you forsake my
WE are the more bound to your humanity , Sir .
Only these two have so little of Man in
'em , they are no part of my care .
Yes , Sir , let me pray you for this Gentleman , he
belongs to my Sister the Bride .
In what place , Sir ?
Of her delight , Sir , below the stairs , and in
publick : her Poet , Sir .
A Poet ?
I will challenge him my self presently
at ex tempore .
Mount up thy Phlegon Muse , and testifie ,
How Saturn sitting in an Ebon Cloud ,
Disrob 'd his Podex white as Ivory ,
And through the Welkin thundred all aloud .
He is not for ex tempore , Sir . He is all for the
pocked-Muse : please you command a sight of it .
Yes , yes , search him for a taste of his Vein .
You must not deny the Queens Justice , Sir , un-
der a Writ o ' Rebellion .
What ! all this Verse ?
Body o 'me , he carries a
whole Realm , a Common-wealth of Paper in 's Hose !
let 's see some of his subjects .
Unto the boundless Ocean of thy Face ,
Runs this poor River charg 'd with streams of Eyes .
How ?
this is stoln !
A Parodie ! a Parodie ! with a kind of miracu-
lous gift , to make it absurder than it was .
Is all the rest of this batch ?
Bring me a Torch ;
lay it together , and give fire .
Cleanse the Air .
Here
was enough to have infected the whole City , if it had
not been taken in time ! See , see , how our Poets glory
shines ! brighter and brighter ! still it increases ! O , now
it 's at the highest : and now it declines as fast .
You
may see , Sic transit gloria mundi .
There 's an Emblem for you Son , and your Stu-
dies !
Nay , no speech or act of mine be drawn a -
gainst such as profess it worthily .
They are not born
every Year , as an Alderman .
There goes more to the
making of a good Poet , than a Sheriff .
Mr. Kitely .
You look upon me ! though , I live i' the City here , a -
mongst you , I will do more Reverence to him , when I
meet him , than I will to the Mayor out of his Year .
But these Paper-pedlers ! these Ink-dablers ! They can-
not expect reprehension or reproach .
They have it
with the fact .
Sir , you have sav 'd me the labour of a de-
It shall be discourse for Supper ; between your
Father and me , if he dare undertake me .
But to dis -
patch away these , you sign o ' the Soldier , and Picture o '
the Poet ( but both so false , I will not ha' you hang 'd
out at my Door till midnight ) while we are at Sup -
per , you two shall penitently fast it out in my Court
without ; and , if you will , you may pray there that we
may be so merry within as to forgive or forget you ,
when we come out .
Here 's a third , because we tender
you safety , shall watch you , he is provided for the pur-
Look to your Charge , Sir .
And what shall I do ?
O ! I had lost a Sheep an' he had not bleated !
Why , Sir , you shall give Mr. Down-right his Cloke : and
I will intreat him to take it .
A Trencher and a Nap -
kin you shall have i' the Buttry , and keep Cob and his
Wife company here ; whom I will intreat first to be
reconcil 'd : and you to endeavour with your wit to
keep 'em so .
I 'll do my best .
Why , now I see thou art honest , Tib , I receive
thee as my dear and mortal Wife again .
And I you , as my loving and obedient Husband .
Good complement ! It will be their Bridal
Night too .
They are married anew .
Come , I conjure
the rest to put off all discontent .
You , Mr. Down-right ,
your Anger ; you , Master Kno'well , your Cares ; Master
Kitely and his Wife , their Jealousie .
For , I must tell you both , while that is fed ,
Horns i' the Mind are worse than o ' the Head .
Sir , thus they go from me ; kiss me , sweet
See what a drove of Horns flie in the Air ,
Wing 'd with my cleansed and my credulous breath !
Watch 'em suspicious Eyes , watch where they fall .
See , see ! on Heads , that think th'have none at all !
O , what a plenteous World of this will come !
When Air rains Horns , all may be sure of some .
I ha' learn 'd so much Verse out of a jealous Man 's part
in a Play .
' Tis well , 'tis well ! This Night we 'll dedicate
to Friendship , Love , and Laughter .
Master Bridegroom ,
take your Bride and lead : every one a fellow .
Here is
my Mistris .
Brain-worm ! to whom all my Addresses
of Courtship shall have their reference .
Whose Ad-
ventures this Day , when our Grand-Children shall hear
to be made a fable , I doubt not but it shall find both
Spectators and Applause .
