I am at my wit 's end , Savorwit .
And I am ev'n following after you as fast as I can , sir .
My wife will be forc 'd from me , my pleasure !
Talk no more on't , sir . How can there be any
Hope i' th ' middle when we 're both at our
Wit 's end in the beginning ? My invention
Was ne 'er so gravel 'd since I first set out upon't .
Nor does my stop stick only in this wheel ,
Though it be a main vexation , but I 'm grated
In a dear absolute friend , young Master Sandfield--
Ay , there 's another rub too .
Who supposes
That I make love to his affected mistress ,
When 'tis my father works against the peace
Of both our spirits , and woos unknown to me .
He strikes out sparks of undeserved anger
' Twixt old steel friendship and new stony hate ,
As much forgetful of the merry hours
The circuits of our youth hath spent and worn
As if they had not been or we not born .
See where he comes .
Unmerciful in torment !
Will this disease never forsake mine eye ?
It must be kill 'd first if it grow so painful .
Work it out strongly at one time that th ' anguish
May never more come near thy precious sight .
If my eternal sleep will give thee rest ,
Close up mine eyes with opening of my breast .
I feel thy wrongs at midnight and the weight
Of thy close treacheries . Thou hast a friendship
As dangerous as a strumpet 's , that will kiss
Men into poverty , distress , and ruin ;
And to make clear the face of thy foul deeds ,
Thou work 'st by seconds .
Then may the sharp point of an inward horror
Strike me to earth , and save thy weapon guiltless !
Not in thy father ?
How much is truth abus 'd
When 'tis kept silent !
SANDFIELD
Oh , defend me friendship !
True , your anger 's in an error all this while , sir ,
But that a lover 's weapon ne 'er hears reason ;
' Tis out still like a mad man 's . Hear but me , sir :
' Tis my young master 's injury , not yours ,
That you quarrel with him for , and this shows
As if y ' would challenge a lame man the field
And cut off 's head because he has lost his legs .
His grief makes him dead flesh , as it appear 'd
By off'ring up his breast to you ; for believe it , sir ,
Had he not greater crosses of his own ,
Your hilts could not cross him .
How ?
Not your hilts , sir .
Come , I must have you friends ; a pox of weapons !
There 's a whore gapes for't ; put it up i' th ' scabbard .
Thou'rt a mad slave .
Come , give me both your hands .
Y'are in a quagmire both : should I release you now ,
Your wits would both come home in a stinking pickle ;
Your father 's old nose would smell you out presently .
Tell him the secret , which no mortal knows
But thou and I , and then he will confess
How much he wrong 'd the patience of his friend .
Then thus the marigold opens at the splendour
Of a hot constant friendship 'twixt you both .
' Tis not unknown to your ear some ten years since
My mistress , his good mother , with a daughter
About the age of six , crossing to Jersey ,
Was taken by the Dunkirks , sold both , and separated ,
As the last news brings hot the first and last
So much discover 'd ; for in nine years ' space
No certain tidings of their life or death
Or what place held 'em , earth , the sea , or heaven ,
Came to the old man 's ears , the knight my master ,
Till about five months since , a letter came ,
Sent from the mother , which related all
Their taking , selling , separation ,
And never meeting ; and withal required
Six hundred crowns for ransom , which my old master
No sooner heard the sound but told the sum ,
Gave him the gold , and sent us both aboard .
We landing by the way , having a care
To lighten us of our carriage because gold
Is such a heavy metal , eas 'd our pockets
In wenches ' aprons . Women were made to bear ,
But for us gentlemen , 'tis most unkindly .
Well , sir ?
A pure rogue still !
Amongst the rest , sir ,
' Twas my young master 's chance there to dote finely
Upon a sweet young gentlewoman , but one
That would not sell her honour for the Indies ,
Till a priest struck the bargain , and then half a crown dispatch 'd
it .
To be brief , wedded her and bedded her ,
Brought her home hither to his father 's house ,
And with a fair tale of mine own bringing up ,
She passes for his sister that was sold .
Let me not lose myself in wond 'ring at thee .
But how made you your score even for the mother ?
Pish , easily : we told him how her fortunes
Mock 'd us as they mock 'd her . When we were o ' th ' sea ,
She was o ' th ' land , and as report was given ,
When we were landed , she was gone to heaven .
So he believes two lies one error bred :
The daughter ransom 'd and the mother dead .
Let me admire thee and withal confess
My injuries to friendship .
They 're all pardo n 'd .
These are the arms I bore against my friend .
But what 's all this to th ' present ? This discourse
Leaves you i' th ' bog still .
On , good Savorwit !
For yet our policy has cross 'd ourselves ;
For the old knave , my master , little thinking her
Wife to his son , but his own daughter still ,
Seeks out a match for her--
Here I feel the surgeon
At second dressing .
And h'as entertain 'd
Ev'n for pure need , for fear the glass should crack
That is already broken , but well solder 'd ,
A mere sot for her suitor , a rank fox ,
One Weatherwise , that woos by the almanac ,
Observes the full and change , an errant moon-calf .
And yet , because the fool demands no portion
But the bare down of her smock , the old fellow ,
Worn to the bone with a dry covetous itch ,
To save his purse and yet bestow his child ,
Consents to waste her on lumps of almanac stuff
Kned with May-butter . Now as I have thought on't
I 'll spoil him in the baking .
Prithee , as how , sirrah ?
I 'll give him such a crack in one o ' th ' sides
He shall quite run out of my master 's favour .
I should but too much love thee for that .
Thus , then ,
To help you both at once , and so good night to you .
After my wit has shipp 'd away the fool ,
As he shall part , I 'll buzz into the ear
Of my old master that you , sir , Master Sandfield ,
Dearly affect his daughter and will take her
With little or no portion . Well stood out in't !
Methinks I see him caper at that news
And in the full cry , oh ! This brought about
And wittily dissembled on both parts ,
You to affect his love , he to love yours ,
I 'll so beguile the father at the marriage
That each shall have his own , and both being welcom 'd
And chamber 'd in one house , as 'tis his pride
To have his children 's children got successively
On his forefathers ' feather beds , in the day times ,
To please the old man 's eyesight , you may dally
And set a kiss on the wrong lip ; no sin in't :
Brothers and sisters do 't , cousins do more ,
But pray take heed you be not kin to them .
So in the night time nothing can deceive you ,
Let each know his own work , and there I leave you .
Let me applaud thee .
Bless 'd be all thy ends
That mak 'st arm 'd enemies embracing friends .
About it speedily .
I need no pricking .
I 'm of that mettle , so well-pac 'd and free ,
There 's no good riders that use spur to me .
Oh , are you come ?
Are any comforts coming ?
I never go without 'em .
Thou sport 'st joys that utterance cannot perfect .
Hark , are they risen ?
Yes , long before I left 'em .
And all intend to bring the widow homeward .
Depart then , mistress , to avoid suspect :
Our good shall arrive time enough at your heart .
Poor fools that ever more take a green surfeit
Of the first fruits of joys . Let a man but shake the tree ,
How soon they 'll hold up their laps to receive comfort !
The music that I struck made her soul dance .
Peace !
Here comes the Lady Widow , the late wife
To the deceas 'd Sir Avarice Goldenfleece ,
Second to none for usury and extortion ,
As too well it appears on a poor gentleman ,
One Master Low-water , from whose estate
He pull 'd that fleece that makes his widow weight .
Those are her suitors now , Sir Gilbert Lambston ,
Master Pepperton , Master Overdon .
Nay , good Sir Oliver Twilight , Master Sunset ,
We 'll trouble you no farther .
SUNSET , SIR OLIVER
No trouble , sweet madam .
We 'll see the widow at home ; it shall be
Our charge , that .
It shall be so indeed .
Thanks , good Sir Oliver , and to you both
I am indebted for those courtesies
That will ask me a long time to requite .
Ah , 'tis but your pleasant condition to give it out so , madam .
Mistress Grace and Mistress Jane , I wish you both
A fair contented fortune in your choices ,
And that you happen right .
GRACE , JANE
Thanks to you , good madam .
LADY GOLDENFLEECE
There 's more in that word "right " than
you imagine.--
I now repent , girls , a rash oath I took
When you were both infants , to conceal a secret .
What does't concern , good madam ?
No, no .
Since you are both so well , 'tis well enough .
It must not be reveal 'd ; 'tis now no more
Than like mistaking of one hand for t 'other .
A happy time to you both .
The like to you , madam .
I shall long much to have this riddle open 'd .
I would you were so kind to my poor kinswoman
And the distressed gentleman her husband ,
Poor Master Low-water , who on ruin leans .
You keep this secret as you keep his means .
LADY GOLDENFLEECE
Thanks , good Sir Oliver Twilight . Welcome , sweet
Master Pepperton ; Master Overdon , welcome .
And goes the business well 'twixt those young lovers ?
Betwixt your son and Master Sunset 's daughter ,
The line goes even , sir .
Good lad , I like thee .
But sir , there 's no proportion , height , or evenness
Betwixt that equinoctial and your daughter .
' Tis true , and I 'm right glad on't .
Are you glad , sir ?
There 's no proportion in't .
Ay , marry , am I , sir .
I can abide no word that ends in portion ;
I 'll give her nothing .
Say you should not , sir ,
As I 'll ne 'er urge your worship 'gainst your nature ,
Is there no gentleman , think you , of worth and credit
Will open 's bed to warm a naked maid ?
A hundred gallant fellows , and be glad
To be so set a-work ! Virginity
Is no such cheap ware as you make account on
That it had need with portion be set off ,
For that sets off a portion in these days .
Play on , sweet boy !
Oh , I could hear this music all day long ,
When there 's no money to be parted from !
Strike on , good lad !
Do not wise men and great often bestow
Ten thousand pound in jewels that lie by 'em ?
If so , what jewel can lie by a man
More precious than a virgin ? If none more precious ,
Why should the pillow of a fool be grac 'd
With that brave spirits with dearness have embrac 'd ?
And then , perhaps , ere the third spring come on ,
Sends home your diamond crack 'd , the beauty gone ;
And more to know her , 'cause you shall not doubt her ,
A number of poor sparks twinkling about her .
Now thou play 'st Dowland 's to thy master .
But shall I dry your eyes with a merry jig now
And make you look like sunshine in a shower ?
How , how , my honest boy , sweet Savorwit ?
Young Master Sandfield , gallant Master Sandfield--
Ha ! What of him ?
Affects your daughter strangely .
Brave Master Sandfield ! Let me hug thy zeal
Unto thy master 's house . Ha , Master Sandfield !
But he 'll expect a portion .
Not a whit , sir ,
As you may use the matter .
Nay , and the matter fall into my using
The devil a penny that he gets of me .
He lies at the mercy of your lock and key , sir ;
You may use him as you list .
Say 'st thou me so ?
Is he so far in doing ?
Quite over head and ears , sir .
Nay , more : he means to run mad and break his neck
Off some high steeple if he have her not .
Now bless the young gentleman 's gristles ; I hope
To be a grandfather yet by 'em .
That may you , sir ,
To , marry , a chopping girl with a plump buttock
Will hoist a farthingale at five years old ,
And call a man between eleven and twelve
To take part of a piece of mutton with her .
Ha , precious wag ! Hook him in finely , do .
Make clear the way for him first ; set the gull going .
An ass , an ass ! I 'll quickly dash his wooing .
Why now the clocks
Go right again . It must be a strange wit
That makes the wheels of youth and age so hit ;
The one are dry , worn , rusty , furr 'd , and soiled ;
Love 's wheels are glib , ever kept clean and oil 'd .
I cannot choose but think of this good fortune :
That gallant Master Sandfield !
Stay , stay , stay .
What comfort gives my almanac today ?
Luck , I beseech thee ! Good days ,
evil days , June , July ; speak a good word for me now , and I have
her . Let me see : " the fifth day , 'twixt hawk and buzzard ;
the sixth day , backward and forward . " That was beastly to
me , I remember . " The seventh day , on a slippery pin ; the
eighth day , fire and tow ; the ninth day , the market is marr 'd . "
That 's long of the hucksters , I warrant you ; but now " the
tenth day . " Luck , I beseech thee now before I look into't !
" The eleventh day , against the hair . " A pox on't !
Would that hair had been left out ! " Against the hair ! "
That hair will go nigh to choke me ; had it been against anything
but that , 'twould not have troubled me because it lies cross i'
th ' way . Well , I 'll try the fortune of a good face yet , though
my almanac leave me i' th ' sands .
Such a match , too . I could not wish a better .
Mass , here he walks.--Save you , sweet Sir Oliver !
Sir Oliver Twilight !
Oh , pray come to me a quarter of a year hence ; I have a little
business now .
How , a quarter of a year hence ? What , shall I come to you in
September ?
Nor in November neither , good my friend .
Y'are not a mad knight ; you will not let your daughter hang past
August , will you ? She 'll drop down under tree then . She 's no
winter fruit , I assure you , if you think to put her in crust after
Christmas .
Sir , in a word , depart : my girl 's not for you ;
I gave you a drowsy promise in a dream ,
But broad awake now , I call 't in again .
Have me commended to your wit ; farewell , sir .
Now the devil run away with you , and some lousy fiddler with your
daughter ! May Clerkenwell have the first cut of her and Hound 's
Ditch pick the bones ! I 'll never leave the love of an open-hearted
widow for a narrow-ey 'd maid again , go out of the roadway like
an ass to leap over hedge and ditch : I 'll fall into the beaten
path again and invite the widow home to a banquet . Let who list
seek out new ways , I 'll be at my journey 's end before him .
My almanac told me true how I should fare ;
Let no man think to speed against the hair .
Is there no saving means ? No help religious
For a distressed gentlewoman to live by ?
Has virtue no revenue ? Who has all then ?
Is the world 's lease from hell , the devil head-landlord ?
Oh , how was conscience , the right heir , put by ?
Law would not do such an unrighteous deed ,
Though with the fall of angels 't had been fee 'd .
Where are our hopes in banks ? Was honesty
A younger sister without portion left ?
No dowry in the Chamber beside wantonness ?
O miserable orphan !
' Twixt two extremes runs there no blessed mean ,
No comfortable strain that I may kiss it ?
Must I to whoredom or to beggary lean ,
My mind being sound ? Is there no way to miss it ?
Is't not injustice that a widow laughs
And lays her mourning part upon a wife ?
That she should have the garment , I the heart ;
My wealth her uncle left her , and me her grief ?
Yet , stood all miseries in their loathed 'st forms
On this hand of me , thick like a foul mist ,
And here the bright enticements of the world
In clearest colours , flattery , and advancement ,
And all the bastard glories this frame jets in ,
Horror nor splendour , shadows fair nor foul
Should force me shame my husband , wound my soul .
Cousin , y 'are welcome . This is kindly done of you
To visit the despis 'd .
I hope not so , coz .
The want of means cannot make you despis 'd ;
Love not by wealth but by desert is priz 'd .
Y'are pleas 'd to help it well , coz .
I am come to you ,
Beside my visitation , to request you
To lay your wit to mine , which is but simple ,
And help me to untie a few dark words
Made up in knots--they 're of the widow 's knitting ,
That ties all sure--for my wit has not strength
Nor cunning to unloose 'em .
Good , what are they ,
Though there be little comfort of my help ?
She wish 'd Sir Oliver 's daughter and myself
Good fortune in our choices and repented her
Of a rash oath she took when we were both infants ,
A secret to conceal ; but since all 's well ,
She holds it best to keep it unreveal 'd .
Now what this is , heaven knows .
Nor can I guess .
The course of her whole life and her dead husband 's
Was ever full of such dishonest riddles
To keep right heirs from knowledge of their own .
And now I 'm put i' th ' mind on't , I believe
It was some piece of land or money given
By some departing friend upon their deathbed ,
Perhaps to yourself , and Sir Oliver 's daughter
May wrongfully enjoy it , and she hired ,
For she was but an hireling in those days ,
To keep the injury secret .
The most likeliest
That ever you could think on .
Is it not ?
Sure , coz . I think you have untied the knot ;
My thoughts lie at more ease . As in all other things ,
In this I thank your help , and may you live
To conquer your own troubles and cross ends ,
As you are ready to supply your friends .
I thank you for the kind truth of your heart ,
In which I flourish when all means depart .
Sure in that oath of hers there sleeps some wrong
Done to my kinswoman .
Who 'd you speak withal ?
The gentlewoman of this house , forsooth .
Whose footman are you ?
One Sir Gilbert Lambston 's .
Sir Gilbert Lambston 's ? There my cousin walks .
Thank your good worship .
How now , whence are you ?
This letter will make known .
Whence comes it , sir ?
From the knight , my master , Sir Gilbert Lambston .
Return't ; I 'll receive none
on't !
There it must lie then ;
I were as good run to Tyburn afoot and hang myself
At mine own charges as carry it back again .
Life , had he not his answer ? What strange impudence
Governs in man when lust is lord of him ?
Thinks he me mad , 'cause I have no moneys on earth ,
That I 'll go forfeit my estate in heaven
And live eternal beggar ? He shall pardon me ,
That 's my soul 's jointure ; I 'll starve ere I sell that .
Oh , is he gone , and left the letter here ?
Yet I will read it , more to hate the writer .
" Mistress Low-water , if you desire to understand
your own comfort , hear me out ere you refuse me . I 'm in the way
now to double the yearly means that first I offered you ; and to
stir you more to me , I 'll empty your enemy 's bags to maintain
you , for the rich widow , the Lady Goldenfleece , to whom I have
been a longer suitor than you an adversary , hath given me so
much encouragement lately , insomuch that I am perfectly assured
the next meeting strikes the bargain . The happiness that follows
this 'twere idle to inform you of ; only consent to my desires ,
and the widow 's notch shall lie open to you . Thus much to your
heart ; I know y 'are wise . Farewell . Thy friend to his power ,
and another 's , Gilbert Lambston . "
In this poor brief , what volumes has he thrust
Of treacherous perjury and adulterous lust !
So foul a monster does this wrong appear
That I give pity to mine enemy here .
What a most fearful love reigns in some hearts
That dare oppose all judgment to get means ,
And wed rich widows only to keep queans .
What a strange path he takes to my affection ,
And thinks 't the near 'st way , 'twill never be ,
Goes through mine enemy 's ground to come to me .
This letter is most welcome ; I repent now
That my last anger threw thee at my feet :
My bosom shall receive thee .
' Tis good policy too ,
To keep one that so mortally hates the widow ;
She 'll have more care to keep it close herself .
And look what wind her revenge goes withal :
The self-same gale whisks up the sails of love .
I shall loose much good sport by that.--
Now , my sweet mistress !
Sir Gilbert , you change suits oft ;
You were here in black but lately .
My mind ne 'er shifts though .
A foul mind the whilst--
But sure , sir , this is but a dissembling glass
You sent before you ; 'tis not possible
Your heart should follow your hand .
Then may both perish !
MISTRESS LOW-WATER
Do not wish that so soon , sir . Can you make
A three-months ' love to a rich widow 's bed ,
And lay her pillow under a quean 's head ?
I know you ca n't , howe 'er you may dissemble 't ;
You have a heart brought up better .
Faith , you wrong me in't ;
You shall not find it so . I do protest to thee ,
I will be lord of all my promises ,
And ere 't be long , thou shalt but turn a key
And find 'em in thy coffer ; for my love ,
In matching with the widow , is but policy
To strengthen my estate and make me able
To set off all thy kisses with rewards :
That the worst weather our delights behold ,
It may hail pearl and shower the widow 's gold .
You talk of a brave world , sir .
' Twill seem better
When golden happiness breaks forth itself
Out of the east port of the widow 's chamber .
And here it sets .
Here shall the downfall be ;
Her wealth shall rise from her and set in thee .
You men have th ' art to overcome poor women .
Pray give my thoughts the freedom of one day ,
And all the rest take you .
I straight obey .
This bird 's my own .
There is no happiness but has her season :
Herein the brightness of her virtue shines .
The husk falls off in time that long shuts up
The fruit in a dark prison ; so sweeps by
The cloud of miseries from wretches ' eyes
That yet , though fall 'n , at length they see to rise :
The secret powers work wondrously and duly .
Why , how now , Kate ?
Oh , are you come , sir ? Husband ,
Wake , wake , and let not patience keep thee poor ;
Rouse up thy spirit from this falling slumber .
Make thy distress seem but a weeping dream
And this the opening morning of thy comforts .
Wipe the salt dew off from thy careful eyes ,
And drink a draught of gladness next thy heart
T' expel the infection of all poisonous sorrows .
You turn me past my senses .
Will you but second
The purpose I intend , I 'll be first forward .
I crave no more of thee but a following spirit ;
Will you but grant me that ?
Why , what 's the business
That should transport thee thus ?
Hope of much good ,
No fear of the least ill : take that to comfort thee .
Yea ?
Sleep not on't ; this is no slumbering business .
' Tis like the sweating sickness : I must keep
Your eyes still wake ; y 'are gone if once you sleep.
I will not rest then till thou hast thy wishes .
Peruse this love paper as you go .
A letter ?
Good Master Sandfield , for the great affection
You bear toward my girl , I am well pleas 'd
You should enjoy her beauty . Heaven forbid , sir ,
That I should cast away a proper gentleman
So far in love with a sour mood or so .
No, no ,
I 'll not die guilty of a lover 's neck-cracking .
Marry , as for portion , there I leave you , sir ,
To the mercy of your destiny again ;
I 'll have no hand in that .
Faith , something , sir ;
Be 't but t ' express your love .
I have no desire , sir ,
To express my love that way , and so rest satisfied .
I pray take heed in urging that too much
You draw not my love from me .
Fates foresee , sir .
Faith , then you may go ; seek out a high steeple
Or a deep water : there 's no saving of you .
How naturally he plays upon himself !
Marry , if a wedding dinner , as I told you ,
And three years ' board , well lodg 'd in mine house ,
And eating , drinking , and a sleeping portion
May give you satisfaction , I am your man , sir ;
Seek out no other .
I am content to embrace it , sir ,
Rather than hazard languishment or ruin .
I love thee for thy wisdom ; such a son-in-law
Will cheer a father 's heart . Welcome , sweet Master Sandfield .
Whither away , boys ? Philip ?
To visit my love , sir ,
Old Master Sunset 's daughter .
That 's my Philip .
Ply 't hard , my good boys both , put 'em to't finely .
One day , one dinner and one house shall join you .
That 's our desire , sir .
Pish ! Come hither , Savorwit .
Observe my son and bring me word , sweet boy ,
Whether h'as a speeding wit or no in wooing .
That will I , sir . That your own eyes might tell
you .
I think it speedy : your girl has a round belly .
How soon the comfortable shine of joy
Breaks through a cloud of grief !
The tears that I let fall for my dead wife
Are dried up with the beams of my girl 's fortunes .
Her life , her death , and her ten years ' distress
Are ev'n forgot with me ; the love and care
That I ought her , her daughter sh ' owes it all :
It can but be bestow 'd , and there 'tis well .
How now , what news ?
There 's a Dutch merchant , sir ,
That 's now come over desires some conference with you .
How ? A Dutch merchant ? Pray send him in to me .
What news with him , trow ?
Sir Oliver Twilight ?
That 's my name indeed , sir .
I pray be covered , sir ; y 'are very welcome .
This is my business , sir . I took into my charge
A few words to deliver to yourself
From a dear friend of yours that wonders strangely
At your unkind neglect .
Indeed ! What might
He be , sir ?
Nay , y 'are i' th ' wrong gender now ;
' Tis that distressed lady , your good wife , sir .
What say you , sir ? My wife ?
Yes , sir , your wife !
This strangeness now of yours seems more to harden
Th' uncharitable neglect she tax 'd you for .
Pray give me leave , sir . Is my wife alive ?
Came any news to you , sir , to th ' contrary ?
Yes , by my faith , did there .
Pray , how long since , sir ?
' Tis now some ten weeks .
Faith , within this month , sir ,
I saw her talk and eat ; and those in our calendar
Are signs of life and health .
Mass , so they are in ours .
And these were the last words her passion threw me :
" No grief , " quoth she , " sits to my heart so close
As his unkindness and my daughter 's loss . "
You make me weep and wonder , for I swear
I sent her ransom , and that daughter 's here .
Here ! That will come well to lighten her of one grief .
I long to see her for the piteous moan
Her mother made for her .
That shall you , sir . Within there !
Sir ?
Call down my daughter .
Yes , sir .
Here 's strange budgelling ! I tell you , sir ,
Those that I put in trust were near me , too ;
A man would think they should not juggle with me :
My own son , and my servant , no worse people , sir .
And yet , ofttimes , sir , what worse knave to a man
Than he that eats his meat ?
Troth , you say true , sir .
I sent 'em simply , and that news they brought ,
My wife had left the world ; and with that sum
I sent to her , this brought his sister home .
Look you , sir , this is she .
If my eye sin not , sir ,
Or misty error falsify the glass ,
I saw that face at Antwerp in an inn
When I set forth first to fetch home this boy .
How ? In an inn ?
Oh , I am betray 'd , I fear !
How do you , young mistress ?
Your eyes wrong your tongue , sir ,
And makes you sin in both ; I am not she .
No ? Then I never saw face twice . Sir Oliver Twilight ,
I tell you my free thoughts : I fear y 'are blinded .
I do not like this story ; I doubt much
The sister is as false as the dead mother .
Yea ! Say you so , sir ? I see nothing lets me ,
But to doubt so too then .
So , to your chamber ; we have done with you .
I would be glad you had . Here 's a strange storm.--
Sift it out well , sir ; till anon I leave you , sir .
Business commands me hence , but as a pledge
Of my return , I 'll leave my little son with you ,
Who yet takes little pleasure in this country
' Cause he can speak no English , all Dutch he .
A fine boy ; he 's welcome , sir , to me .
Where 's your leg and your thanks to the gentleman ?
What says he , sir ?
He thanks you for your kindness .
Pretty knave !
Had not some business held me by the way ,
This news had come to your ear ten days ago .
It comes too soon now , methinks ; I 'm your debtor .
But I could wish it , sir , for better ware .
We must not be our own choosers in our fortunes .
Here 's a cold pie to breakfast : wife alive ,
The daughter doubtful , and the money spent !
How am I juggled withal !
It hits i'faith , sir ;
The work goes even .
Oh , come , come , come , are you come , sir ?
Life , what 's the matter now ?
There 's a new reckoning
Come in since .
Pox on't ! I thought all had been paid ;
I ca n't abide these after-reckonings .
I pray come near , sir ; let 's be acquainted with you .
You 're bold enough abroad with my purse , sir .
No more than beseems manners and good use , sir .
Did not you bring me word some ten weeks since
My wife was dead ?
Yes , true , sir , very true , sir .
Pray stay ! And take my horse along with you ,
And with the ransom that I sent for her
That you redeem 'd my daughter ?
Right as can be , sir ;
I never found your worship in a false tale yet .
I thank you for your good word , sir , but I 'm like
To find your worship now in two at once .
I should be sorry to hear that .
I believe you , sir .
Within this month my wife was sure alive--
There 's six weeks bated of your ten-weeks ' lie--
As has been credibly reported to me
By a Dutch merchant , father to that boy ,
But now come over , and the words scarce cold .
Oh , strange!--'Tis a most rank untruth ; where
is he , sir ?
He will not be long absent .
All 's confounded.--
If he were here , I 'll tell him to his face , sir ;
He wears a double tongue : that 's Dutch and English .
Will the boy say 't ?
' Las , he can speak no English .
All the better ; I 'll gabble something to him.--
Why la , I thought as much .
What says the boy ?
He says his father is troubled with an imperfection at one time
of the moon and talks like a madman .
What ? Does the boy say so ?
I knew there was somewhat in't .
Your wife alive ! Will you believe all tales , sir ?
Nay , more , sir : he told me he saw this wench
Which you brought home at Antwerp in an inn ,
Tells me I 'm plainly cozen 'd of all hands ,
' Tis not my daughter neither .
All 's broke out.--
How ? Not your daughter , sir ? I must to't again .
Oh , Ah ha ! I thought how 'twould prove i'
th ' end . The boy says they never came near Antwerp : a quite contrary
way , round about by Parma .
What 's the same
That is , he saw no such wench in an inn . ' Tis well I came in
such happy time to get it out of the boy before his father returned
again . Pray be wary , sir ; the world 's subtle : come and pretend
a charitable business in policy , and work out a piece of money
on you .
Mass , art advis 'd of that ?
The age is cunning , sir ; beside , a Dutchman will live upon any
ground and work butter out of a thistle .
Troth , thou say 'st true in that : they 're the best thrivers in
turnips , hartichalks , and cabishes ; our English are not like them .
Oh , fie , no , sir !
Ask him from whence they came , when they came hither .
What , what ? I cannot blame him then .
What says he to thee ?
The poor boy blushes for him ; he tells me his father came from
making merry with certain of his countrymen and he 's a little
steep 'd in English beer . There 's no heed to be taken of his tongue
now .
Hoyda ! How com 'st thou by all this ? I heard him speak but three
words to thee .
Oh , sir , the Dutch is a very wide language . You shall have ten
English words even for one , as for example ,
there 's a word for you , master .
Why , what 's that same
How do you and all your generation .
Why , 'tis impossible ! How prove you that , sir ?
and , your generation .
' Tis a most saucy language ; how cam 'st thou by 't ?
I was brought up to London in an eelship ;
There was the place I caught it first by th ' tail .
I shall be tripp 'd anon ; pox , would I were gone!--
I 'll go seek out your son , sir ; you shall hear
What thunder he 'll bring with him .
Do , do , Savorwit ;
I 'll have you all face to face .
Cuds me ! What else , sir ?
And you take me so near the net again ,
I 'll give you leave to squat me ! I have 'scap 'd fairly .
We are undone in Dutch ; all our three-months ' roguery
Is now come over in a butter firkin .
Never was man so toss 'd between two tales !
I know not which to take , not which to trust .
The boy here is the likeliest to tell truth ,
Because the world 's corruption is not yet
At full years in him ; sure he cannot know
What deceit means : 'tis English yet to him .
And when I think again , why should the father
Dissemble for no profit ? He gets none ,
Whate 'er he hopes for , and I think he hopes not .
The man 's in a good case : being old and weary ,
He dares not lean his arm on his son 's shoulder
For fear he lie i' th ' dirt , but must be rather
Beholding to a stranger for his prop .
I make bold once again , sir , for a boy here .
Oh , sir , y 'are welcome . Pray resolve me one thing , sir :
Did you within this month , with your own eyes ,
See my wife living ?
I ne 'er borrowed any .
Why should you move that question , sir ? Dissembling
Is no part of my living .
I have reason
To urge it so far , sir , pray be not angry though ,
Because my man was here since your departure ,
Withstands all stiffly , and to make it clearer ,
Question 'd your boy in Dutch , who , as he told me ,
Return 'd this answer first to him : that you
Had imperfection at one time o ' th ' moon
Which made you talk so strangely .
Why , la you , sir ! Here 's no such thing ;
He says he lies in 's throat that says it .
Then the rogue lies in 's throat , for he told me so ,
And that the boy should answer at next question
That you ne 'er saw this wench nor came near Antwerp .
He says he told him no such matter ; he 's a knave and a rascal .
Why , how am I abus 'd ? Pray tell me one thing :
What 's in Dutch ?
How ?
There 's no such thing in Dutch ; it may be an ass
In English .
Hoyda ! Then am I that ass
In plain English : I am grossly cozen 'd , most
Inconsiderately ! Pray let my house receive you
For one night that I may quit these rascals ,
I beseech you , sir .
If that may stead you , sir ,
I 'll not refuse you .
A thousand thanks , and welcome .
On whom can fortune more spit out her foam :
Work 'd on abroad and play 'd upon at home !
So , set the table ready . The widow 's i' th ' next room , looking
upon my clock with the days and the months and the change of the
moon ; I 'll fetch her in presently .
She 's not so mad to be fetch 'd in with the moon , I warrant you .
A man must go roundlier to work with a widow than to woo her
with the hand of a dial , or stir up her blood with the striking
part of a clock ; I should ne 'er stand to show her such things
in chamber .
Welcome , sweet widow , to a bachelor 's house here ; a single man
I , but for two or three maids that I keep.
Why , are you double with them then ?
An exceeding good mourning wit ! Women are wiser than ever they
were since they wore doublets . You must think , sweet widow , if
a man keep maids , they 're under his subjection .
That 's most true , sir .
They have no reason to have a lock but the master must have a
key to't .
To him , Sir Gilbert . He fights with me at a wrong weapon now .
Nay , and Sir Gilbert strike , my weapon falls ;
I fear no thrust but his . Here are more shooters ,
But they have shot two arrows without heads ;
They cannot stick i' th ' butt yet . Hold out , knight ,
And I 'll cleave the black pin i' th ' midst o ' th ' white .
Nay , and he led me into a closet , sir , where he showed me diet
drinks for several months , as scurvigrass for April , clarified
whey for June , and the like .
Oh , madam , he is a most necessary property , an't be but to save
our credit , ten pound in a banquet .
Go , y 'are a wag , Sir Gilbert .
How many there be in the world of his fortunes that prick their
own calves with briers to make an easy passage for others , or
like a toiling usurer sets his son a-horseback in cloth-of-gold
breeches while he himself goes t ' th ' devil afoot in a pair of
old strossers .
But shall I give a more familiar sign ?
His are the sweetmeats , but the kisses mine .
Excellent . A pox o ' your fortune !
Saucy courting has brought all modest
wooing clean out of fashion . You shall have few maids nowadays
got without rough handling ; all the town 's so us 'd to't , and most
commonly too they 're join 'd before they 're married because they 'll
be sure to be fast enough .
Sir , since he strives t ' oppose himself against us ,
Let 's so combine our friendships in our straits
By all means graceful to assist each other .
For I protest it shall as much glad me
To see your happiness and his disgrace ,
As if the wealth were mine , the love , the place .
And with the like faith I reward your friendship .
I 'll break the bawdy ranks of his discourse
And scatter his libidinous whispers straight.--
Madam .
How cheer you , gentlemen ?
Pox on 'em !
They wak 'd me out of a fine sleep; three minutes
Had fasten 'd all the treasure in mine arms .
You took no note of this conceit ,
it seems , madam .
Twelve trenchers , upon every one a month .
January , February , March , April--
Ay , and their posies under 'em .
Pray , what says May ? She 's the spring lady .
PEPPERTON
" Now gallant May in her array ,
Doth make the field pleasant and gay . "
" This month of June use clarified whey ,
Boil 'd with cold herbs , and drink alway . "
Drink't all away , he should say .
' Twere much better indeed , and wholesomer for his liver .
September 's a good one here , madam .
Oh , have you chose your month ? Let 's hear't , Sir Gilbert .
" Now mayst thou physics safely take ,
And bleed , and bathe for thy health 's sake .
Eat figs and grapes and spicery
For to refresh thy members dry . "
Thus it is still when a man 's simple meaning lights among wantons .
How many honest words have suffered corruption since Chaucer 's
days ? A virgin would speak those words then that a very midwife
would blush to hear now , if she have but so much blood left to
make up an ounce of grace . And who is this long on but such wags
as you that use your words like your wenches ? You cannot let
'em pass honestly by you , but you must still have a flirt at 'em .
You have paid some of us home , madam .
If conceit will strike this stroke , have at the
widow 's plumtree . I 'll put 'em down all for a banquet.--Widow
and gentlemen , my friends and servants , I make you wait long here
for a bachelor 's pittance .
Oh , sir , y 'are pleas 'd to be modest .
No, by my troth , widow . You shall find it otherwise .
What , the twelve signs ?
These are the signs of my love , widow .
Worse meat would have serv 'd us , sir . By my faith ,
I 'm sorry you should be at such charges , sir ,
To feast us a whole month together here .
Widow , thou'rt welcome a whole month , and ever .
And what be those , sir , that brought in the banquet ?
Those are my tenants ; they stand for fasting days .
Or the six weeks in Lent .
Y'are i' th ' right , Sir Gilbert .
Sweet widow , take your place at Aries here ;
That 's the head sign . A widow is the head
Till she be married .
What is she then ?
The middle .
' Tis happy she 's no worse .
Taurus , Sir Gilbert Lambston , that 's for you .
They say you 're a good town-bull .
Oh , spare your friends , sir .
And Gemini for Master Pepperton .
He had two boys at once by his last wife .
I hear the widows find no fault with that ,
sir .
Cancer the Crab for Master Overdon ,
For when a thing 's past fifty , it grows crooked .
Now for yourself , sir .
Take no care for me ,
Widow : I can be anywhere . Here 's Leo ,
Heart and back ; Virgo , guts and belly .
I can go lower yet , and yet fare better ,
Since Sagittarius fits me the thighs ;
I care not if I be about the thighs ,
I shall find meat enough .
But under pardon , sir .
Though you be lord o ' th ' feast and the conceit both ,
Methinks it had been proper for the banquet
To have had the signs all fill 'd and no one idle .
I know it had , but whose fault 's that , widow ?
You should have got you more suitors to have stopp 'd
The gaps .
Nay , sure , they should get us , and not
We them . There be your tenants , sir ; we are
Not proud ; you may bid them sit down .
By th ' mass ,
It 's true too . Then sit down , tenants ,
Once with your hats on , but spare the meat , I charge you ,
As you hope for new leases . I must make
My signs draw out a month yet , with a bit
Every morning to breakfast , and at
Full moon with a whole one ; that 's restorative .
Sit round , sit round , and do not speak , sweet tenants .
You may be bold enough , so you eat but little .
How like you this now , widow ?
It shows well , sir ;
And like the good old hospitable fashion .
How ! Like a good old hospital ! My mistress makes
an arrant gull on him .
But yet methinks there wants clothes for the feet .
That part 's uncovered yet . Push , no matter for the feet .
Yes , if the feet catch cold , the head will feel it .
Why then you may draw up your legs , and lie
Rounder together .
H'as answered you well , madam .
And you draw up your legs too , widow , my tenant
Will feel you there , for he 's one of the calves .
Better and better , sir ; your wit fattens as he feeds .
Sh'as took the calf from his tenant and put it
upon his ground now .
How now , my lady 's man , what 's the news , sir ?
Madam , there 's a young gentleman below ;
H'as earnest business to your ladyship .
Another suitor , I hold my life , widow .
What is he , sir ?
He seems a gentleman ,
That 's the least of him , and yet more I know not .
Under the leave o ' th ' master of the house here ,
I would he were admitted .
With all my heart , widow ; I fear him not .
Come cut and long tail !
I have the least fear
And the most firmness ; nothing can shake me .
If he be a gentleman , he 's welcome ;
There 's a sign does nothing , and that 's fit
For a gentleman . The feet will be kept warm
Enough now for you , widow , for if he be
A right gentleman , he has his stockings warm 'd
And he wears socks beside , partly for warmth ,
Partly for cleanliness ; and if he observe
Fridays too , he comes excellent well .
Pisces will be a fine fish dinner for him .
Why then you mean , sir , he shall sit as he comes ?
Ay , and he were a lord , he shall not sit
Above my tenants . I 'll not have two lords
To them , so I may go look my rent
In another man 's breeches . I was
Not brought up to be so unmannerly .
I have pick 'd out a bold time.--Much good do you ,
Gentlemen .
Y'are welcome as I may say , sir .
Pardon my rudeness , madam .
No such fault , sir ;
You 're too severe to yourself ; our judgment quits you .
Please you to do as we do .
Thanks , good madam .
Make room , gentlemen .
Sit still , tenants .
I 'll call in all your old leases and rack you else .
Oh , sweet landlord !
Take my cloak , sirrah .
If any be disturb 'd , I 'll not sit , gentlemen .
I see my place .
A proper woman turn 'd gallant !
If the widow refuse me , I care not
If I be a suitor to him . I have known
Those who have been as mad , and given half
Their living for a male companion .
How , Pisces ! Is that mine ? ' Tis a conceited
banquet .
If you love any fish , pray fall to , sir .
If you had come sooner , you might have happened
Among some of the flesh signs , but now they 're all taken up ;
Virgo had been a good dish for you , had not
One of my tenants been somewhat busy with her .
Pray let him keep her , sir ; give me meat fresh :
I 'd rather have whole fish than broken flesh .
What say you to a bit of Taurus ?
No, I thank you , sir ;
The bull 's too rank for me .
How , sir ?
Too rank , sir .
Fie , I shall strike you dumb like all your fellows .
What , with your heels or horns ?
Perhaps with both .
It must be at dead low water , when I 'm dead then .
' Tis brave , Kate , and nobly spoke of thee .
This quarrel must be drown 'd . Pickadille , my lady 's fool !
You 're your own man , sir .
Prithee , step in to one o ' th ' maids .
That I will , sir , and thank you , too .
Nay , hark you , sir : call for my sun-cup presently ; I 'd forgot
it .
How , your sun-cup ? Some cup , I warrant , that he
stole out o ' th ' Sun Tavern .
The more I look on him , the more I thirst for't .
Methinks his beauty does so far transcend ,
Turns the signs back , makes that the upper end .
How cheer you , widow ? Gentlemen , how cheer you ?
Fair weather in all quarters !
The sun will peep anon ; I have sent one for him .
In the meantime I 'll tell you a tale of these .
This Libra here that keeps the scale so even
Was i' th ' old time an honest chandler 's widow
And had one daughter which was called Virgo ,
Which now my hungry tenant has deflower 'd .
This Virgo , passing for a maid , was sued to
By Sagittarius there , a gallant shooter ,
And Aries , his head rival ; but her old crabbed
Uncle Cancer here , dwelling in Crooked Lane ,
Still cross 'd the marriage , minding to bestow her
Upon one Scorpio , a rich usurer .
The girl , loathing that match , fell into folly
With one Taurus , a gentleman in Townbull Street ,
By whom she had two twins , those Gemini there ,
Of which two brats she was brought abed in Leo
At the Red Lion about Tower Hill .
Being in this distress , one Capricorn ,
An honest citizen , pitied her case and married her
To Aquarius , an old water-bearer ,
And Pisces was her living ever after ;
At Standard she sold fish where he drew water .
It shall be yours , sir .
Meat and mirth too ! Y'are lavish ;
Your purse and tongue has been at cost today , sir .
You may challenge all comers at these twelve weapons , I warrant
you .
Your sun-cup call you it ! ' Tis a simple voyage that I have made
here . I have left my doublet within for fear I should sweat through
my jerkin , and thrown a cypress over my face for fear of sun burning .
How now , who 's this ? Why , sirrah !
Can you endure it , mistress ?
Endure what , fool ?
Fill the cup , coxcomb .
Nay , an't be no hotter , I 'll go put on my doublet again .
What a whoreson sot is this !
Prithee , fill the cup , fellow , and give 't the widow .
Sirrah , how stand you ? Bestow your service there
Upon her ladyship .
What 's here ? A sun ?
It does betoken , madam , a cheerful day
To somebody .
It rises full in the face of yon
Fair sign , and yet by course he is the last
Must feel the heat.--Here , gentlemen , to you all ,
For you know the sun must go through the twelve signs .
Most wittily , widow : you jump with my conceit right ;
There 's not a hair between us .
Give it Sir Gilbert .
I am the next through whom the golden flame
Shines when 'tis spent in thy celestial ram ;
The poor feet there must wait and cool a while .
We have our time , sir ; joy and we shall meet :
I have known the proud neck lie between the feet .
So round it goes .
I like this drinking world well .
So fill 't him again .
Fill 't me ? Why , I drunk last , sir .
I know you did , but Gemini must drink twice ,
Unless you mean that one of them shall be chok 'd .
Fly from my heart all variable thoughts !
She that 's entic 'd by every pleasing object
Shall find small pleasure , and as little rest .
This knave hath lov 'd me long ; he 's best and worthiest ,
I cannot but in honour see him requited.--
Sir Gilbert Lambston !
How ! Pardon me , sweet lady ,
That with a bold tongue I strike by your words :
Sir Gilbert Lambston ?
Yes , sir , that 's my name .
There should be a rank villain of that name ;
Came you out of that house ?
How , sir slave !
Fall to your bull ; leave roaring till anon .
Yet again ! And you love me , gentlemen ,
Let 's have no roaring here . If I had thought that ,
I 'd have sent my bull to the bear garden .
Why , so you should have wanted one of your signs .
But I may chance want two now , and they fall
Together by the ears .
What 's the strange fire
That works in these two creatures ? Cold signs both ,
Yet more hot than all their fellows .
Ho , Sol in Pisces !
The sun 's in New Fish Street . Here 's an end of this course .
Madam , I am bold to remember your worship for a year 's wages and
an livery cloak .
How , will you shame me ? Had you not both last week , fool ?
Ay , but there 's another year past since that .
Would all your wit could make that good , sir .
I am sure the sun has run through all the twelve signs since ,
and that 's a year ; these gentlemen can witness .
The fool will live , madam .
Ay , as long as your eyes are open , I warrant him .
Sirrah !
Does your worship call ?
Commend my love and service to the
widow ;
Desire her ladyship to taste that morsel .
This is the bit I watch 'd for all this while ,
But it comes duly .
And wherein has this name of mine offended ,
That y 'are so liberal of your infamous titles ,
I , but a stranger to thee ? It must be known , sir ,
Ere we two part .
Marry , and reason , good sir .
Oh , strike me cold ! This should be your hand , Sir Gilbert ?
Why , make you question of that , madam ? ' Tis one of the letters
I sent you .
Much good do you , gentlemen .
How now ? What 's the matter ?
Look to the widow ; she paints white ! Some
for my lady ! Run , villain !
Can nobody help her case but a lawyer ,
and so many suitors here ?
Oh , treachery unmatch 'd , unheard of !
How do you , madam ?
Oh , impudence as foul ! Does my disease
Ask how I do ? Can it torment my heart
And look with a fresh colour in my face ?
What 's this ? What 's this ?
I am sorry for this qualm , widow .
He that would know a villain when he meets him ,
Let him ne 'er go to a conjurer : here 's a glass
Will show him without money , and far truer !
Preserver of my state , pray tell me , sir ,
That I may pay you all my thanks together ,
What bless 'd hap brought that letter to your hand
From me , so fast lock 'd in mine enemy 's power ?
I will resolve you , madam . I have a kinsman
Somewhat infected with that wanton pity
Which men bestow on the distress of women ,
Especially if they be fair and poor ;
With such hot charity , which indeed is lust ,
He sought t ' entice , as his repentance told me ,
Her whom you call your enemy , the wife
To a poor gentleman , one Low-water--
Right , right , the same .
Had it been right , 't 'ad now been .
And , according to the common rate of sinners ,
Offer 'd large maintenance , which with her seem 'd nothing :
For if she would consent , she told him roundly ,
There was a knight had bid more at one minute
Than all his wealth could compass , and withal
Pluck 'd out that letter as it were in scorn ;
Which , by good fortune , he put up in jest
With promise that the writ should be returnable
The next hour of his meeting . But , sweet madam ,
Out of my love and zeal , I did so practice
The part upon him of an urgent wooer
That neither he nor that return 'd more to her .
Plague o ' that kinsman !
Here 's a gallant rascal !
Sir , you have appear 'd so noble in this action ,
So full of worth and goodness , that my thanks
Will rather shame the bounty of my mind
Than do it honour . Oh , thou treacherous villain !
Does thy faith bear such fruit ?
Are these the blossoms of a hundred oaths
Shot from thy bosom ? Was thy love so spiteful
It could not be content to mock my heart ,
Which is in love a misery too much ,
But must extend so far to the quick ruin
Of what was painfully got , carefully left me ;
And , 'mongst a world of yielding , needy women ,
Choose no one to make merry with my sorrows
And spend my wealth on in adulterous surfeits
But my most mortal enemy ? Oh , despiteful !
Is this thy practice ? Follow it , 'twill advance thee !
Go , beguile on ! Have I so happily found
What many a widow has with sorrow tasted ,
Even when my lip touch 'd the contracting cup ,
Even then to see the spider ? ' Twas miraculous !
Crawl with thy poisons hence , and for thy sake
I 'll never covet titles and more riches ,
To fall into a gulf of hate and laughter .
I 'll marry love hereafter ; I 've enough ,
And wanting that , I have nothing . There 's thy way .
Do you hear , sir ? You must walk .
Hear't ! Thrust him down stairs !
Out of my house , you treacherous , lecherous rascal !
All curses scatter you !
Life , do you thunder here ? If you had stayed a little longer ,
I 'd have ripp 'd out some of my bull out of your belly again .
' Twas a most noble discovery ; we must love you forever for't .
Sir , for your banquet and your mirth , we thank you ;
You , gentlemen , for your kind company ;
But , you , for all my merry days to come ,
Or this had been the last else .
Love and fortune
Had more care of your safety , peace , and state , madam .
Now will I thrust in for't .
I 'm for myself now .
What 's fifty years ? ' Tis man 's best time and season .
Now the knight 's gone , the widow will hear reason .
Now , now ! The suitors flatter ; hold on , Kate :
The hen may pick the meat while the cocks prate .
If thou talk 'st longer , I shall turn to marble ,
And death will stop my hearing .
Horrible fortune !
Nay , sir , our building is so far defac 'd
There is no stuff left to raise up a hope .
Oh , with more patience could my flesh endure
A score of wounds and all their several searchings
Than this that thou hast told me !
Would that Flemish ram
Had ne 'er come near our house ! There 's no going home
As long as he has a nest there , and his young one ,
A little Flanders ' egg new fledg 'd ; they gape
For pork , and I shall be made meat for 'em .
' Tis not the bare news of my mother 's life ,
May she live long and happy , that afflicts me
With half the violence that the latter draws ,
Though in that news I have my share of grief ,
As I had share of sin and a foul neglect :
It is my love 's betraying ; that 's the sting
That strikes through flesh and spirit , and sense nor wit
From thee , in whom I ne 'er saw ebb till now ,
Nor comforts from a faithful friend can ease me .
I 'll try the goodness of a third companion ,
What he 'll do for me .
Hold ! Why , friend ?
Why , master , is this all your kindness , sir ? Offer to steal into
another country and ne 'er take your leave on 's ? Troth , I take
it unkindly at your hands , sir ; but I 'll put it up for once .
Faith , there was no conscience in
this , sir : leave me here to endure all weathers , whilst you make
your soul dance like a juggler 's egg upon the point of a rapier !
By my troth , sir , y 'are too blame in't . You might have given
us an inkling of your journey ; perhaps others would as fain have
gone as you .
Burns this clay lamp of miserable life
When joy , the oil that feeds it , is dried up ?
He has remov 'd his house .
So it seems , madam .
I 'll ask that gentleman . Pray , can you tell me , sir ,
Which is Sir Oliver Twilight 's ?
Few can better , gentlewoman .
It is the next fair house your eye can fix on .
I thank you , sir . Go on .
He had a son about some ten years since .
That son still lives .
I pray , how does he , sir ?
Faith , much about my health ; that 's never worse .
If you have any business to him , gentlewoman ,
I can cut short your journey to the house .
I 'm all that ever was of the same kind .
Oh , my sweet son ! Never fell fresher joy
Upon the heart of mother ! This is he , sir !
My seven years ' travel has ev'n worn him out
Of my remembrance .
Oh , this gear 's worse and worse !
I am so wonderstruck at your bless 'd presence
That through amaz 'd joy , I neglect my duty .
Rise , and a thousand blessings spring up with thee .
I would we had but one in the meantime ;
Let the rest glow at leisure .
But know you not this gentleman yet , son ?
I take it 's Master Beveril .
My name 's Beveril , sir .
Right welcome to my bosom !
You 'd not think , son ,
How much I am beholding to this gentleman
As far as freedom ; he laid out the ransom ,
Finding me so distress 'd .
' Twas worthily done , sir ,
And I shall ever rest your servant for't .
You quite forget your worth . ' Twas my good hap , sir ,
To return home that way after some travels
Where finding your good mother so distress 'd ,
I could not but in pity see her releas 'd .
It was a noble charity , sir ; heaven quit you .
It comes at last .
I left a sister here ,
New married when I last took leave of England .
Oh , Mistress Low-water .
Pray , sir , how does she ?
So little comfort I can give you , sir ,
That I would fain excuse myself for silence .
Why , what 's the worst , sir ?
Wrongs has made her poor .
You strike my heart ! Alas , good gentlewoman !
Here 's a gentleman ; you know him : Master Sandfield .
I crave pardon , sir .
He can resolve you from her kinswoman .
Welcome to England , madam .
Thanks , good sir .
Now there 's no way to 'scape : I 'm
compass 'd round ;
My shame is like a prisoner set with halberds .
Pish , master , master ! ' Tis young flood again ,
And you can take your time now ; away quick !
Push , thou 'st a swimming head .
Will you but hear me ?
When did you lose your tide when I set forth with you ?
That 's true .
Regard me then ; though you have no feeling ,
I would not hang by th ' thumbs with a good will .
I hang by th ' heart , sir , and would fain have ease .
Then this or none . Fly to your mother 's pity ,
For that 's the court must help you : y 'are quite gone
At common law ; no counselor can hear you .
Confess your follies and ask pardon for 'em ,
Tell her the state of all things ; stand not nicely :
The meat 's too hard to be minc 'd now ;
She breeds young bones by this time .
Deal plainly : heaven will bless thee ; turn out all ,
And shake your pockets after it . Beg , weep ,
Kneel , anything ; 'twill break no bones , man .
Let her not rest , take breathing time , nor leave thee
Till thou hast got her help .
Lad , I conceive thee .
About it then ; it requires haste . Do't well :
There 's but a short street between us and hell .
Ah , my poor sister !
' Las , good gentlewoman
My heart ev'n weeps for her .
Nay , son , we 'll go now .
May I crave one word , madam ?
With me , son ?
The more , the better welcome .
Now , now luck !
I pray not often : the last prayer I made
Was nine-year-old last Bartholomew-tide ; 'twould have been
A jolly chopper , and 't 'ad liv 'd till this time .
Why do your words start back ? Are they afraid
Of her that ever lov 'd them ?
I have a suit to you , madam .
You have told me that already ; pray what is't ?
If't be so great my present state refuse it ,
I shall be abler , then command and use it ;
Whate 'er 't be , let me have warning to provide for't .
Provide forgiveness then , for that 's the want
My conscience feels . Oh , my wild youth has led me
Into unnatural wrongs against your freedom once .
I spent the ransom which my father sent
To set my pleasures free , while you lay captive .
He does it finely , faith .
And is this all now ?
You use me like a stranger ; pray stand up .
Rather fall flat ; I shall deserve yet worse .
Whate 'er your faults are , esteem me still
a friend ,
Or else you wrong me more in asking pardon
Than when you did the wrong you ask 'd it for ,
And since you have prepar 'd me to forgive you ,
Pray let me know for what ; the first fault 's nothing .
' Tis a sweet lady , every inch of her .
Here comes the wrong then that drives home the rest .
I saw a face at Antwerp that quite drew me
From conscience and obedience ; in that fray
I lost my heart , I must needs lose my way :
There went the ransom , to redeem my mind ;
'Stead of the money , I brought over her ,
And to cast mists before my father 's eyes ,
Told him it was my sister , lost so long ,
And that yourself was dead . You see the wrong ?
This is but youthful still . Oh , that word " sister "
Afflicts me when I think on't . I forgive thee
As freely as thou didst it . For , alas ,
This may be call 'd good dealing to some parts ,
That love and youth plays daily among sons .
She helps our knavery well ; that 's one good comfort .
But such is the hard plight my state lives in
That 'twixt forgiveness I must sin again ,
And seek my help where I bestow 'd my wrongs .
Oh , mother , pity once , though against reason ,
' Cause I can merit none ; though my wrongs grieve you ,
Yet let it be your glory to relieve me .
Wherein have I given cause yet of mistrust ,
That you should doubt my succour and my love ?
Show me but in what kind I may bestow 'em .
There came a Dutchman with report this day
That you were living .
Came he so lately ?
Yes , madam .
Which news so struck my father on the sudden
That he grows jealous of my faith in both .
These five hours have I kept me from his sight
And wish 'd myself eternally so hid ;
And surely , had not your bless 'd presence quicken 'd
The flame of life in me , all had gone out .
Now to confirm me to his trust again
And settle much aright in his opinion ,
Say but she is my sister , and all 's well .
You ask devotion like a bashful beggar
That pure need urges and not lazy impudence ;
And to express how glad I am to pity you ,
My bounty shall flow over your demand .
I will not only with a constant breath
Approve that , but excuse thee for my death .
Why , here 's a woman made as a man would wish to
have her .
Oh , I am plac 'd higher in happiness
Than whence I fell before !
We 're brave fellows once again , and we can keep
our own . Now , hoffte toffte , our pipes play as loftily !
My sister fled !
Both fled ; that 's the news now . Want must obey ;
Oppressions came so thick , they could not stay .
Mean are my fortunes , yet had I been nigh ,
Distress nor wrong should have made virtue fly .
Spoke like a brother , worthy such a sister .
Grief 's like a new wound ; heat beguiles the sense ,
For I shall feel this smart more three days hence .
Come , madam , sorrow 's rude and forgets manners .
Our knavery is for all the world like a shifting bankrupt ; it
breaks in one place , and sets up in another : he tries all trades ,
from a goldsmith to a tobacco seller , we try all shifts , from
an outlaw to a flatterer ; he cozens the husband , and compounds
with the widow , we cozen my master , and compound with my mistress .
Only here I turn o ' th ' right hand from him : he is known to live
like a rascal , when I am thought to live like a gentleman .
I have sent in one to th ' widow .
Well said , Kate ,
Thou ply 'st thy business close . The coast is clear yet .
Let me but have warning ,
I shall make pretty shift with them .
That thou shalt , wench .
My lady , sir , commends her kindly to you ,
And for the third part of an hour , sir ,
Desires your patience .
Two or three of her tenants out of Kent
Will hold her so long busied .
Thank you , sir .
' Tis fit I should attend her time and leisure .
Those were my tenants once , but what relief
Is there in what hath been or what I was ?
' Tis now that makes the man . A last year 's feast
Yields little comfort for the present humour ;
He starves that feeds his hopes with what is past .
How now ?
They 're come , newly alighted .
Peace , peace !
I 'll have a trick for 'em ; look you second me well now .
I warrant thee .
I must seem very imperious , I can tell you ;
Therefore , if I should chance to use you roughly ,
Pray forgive me beforehand .
With all my heart , Kate .
You must look for no obedience in these clothes ;
That lies in the pocket of my gown .
Well , well , I will not then .
I hear 'em coming ; step back a little , sir .
Where be those fellows ? Who looks out there ? Is there ne 'er
a knave i' th ' house to take those gentlemen 's horses ? Where
wait you today ? How stand you like a dreaming goose in a corner ?
The gentlemen 's horses , forsooth !
Yes , an't like your worship .
What 's here ? A strange alteration !
A new lord ? Would I were upon
my mare 's back again then .
Pray , gentlemen , pardon the rudeness of these grooms ;
I hope they will be brought to better fashion .
In the meantime , y 'are welcome , gentlemen .
We thank you , sir .
out his almanac I 'll hold my life h'as struck the widow i'
th ' right planet . Venus I thought 'twas a lecherous
planet that goes to't with a caudle .
How now , sir ?
The gentlemen 's horses are set up , sir .
No, no , no , we 'll away !
We 'll away .
How ! By my faith , but you shall not yet , by your leave . Where 's
Bess ? Call your mistress , sir , to welcome these kind gentlemen ,
my friends .
PEPPERTON
How ! Bess ?

Peg ?
Plain Bess ! I know how the world
goes then ; he has been abed with Bess , i'faith : there 's no trust
to these widows ; a young horsing gentleman carries 'em away clear .
Now , where 's your mistress , sir ; how chance she comes not ?
Sir , she requests you to excuse her for a while ; she 's busy with
a milliner about gloves .
Gloves ?
Hoyda ! Gloves , too !
Could she find no other time to choose gloves but now when my
friends are here ?
No, sir , 'tis no matter ; we thank you for your good will , sir .
To say truth , we have no business with her at all at this time ,
i'faith , sir .
Oh , that 's another matter ; yet , stay , stay , gentlemen , and taste
a cup of wine ere you go .
No, thank you , sir .
Master Pepperton , Master Weatherwise , will you , sir ?
I 'll see the wine in a drunkard 's
shoes first , and drink't after he has brew 'd it ! But let her
go ; she 's fitted , i'faith . A proud , surly sir here , he domineers
already , one that will shake her bones and go to dice with her
money , or I have no skill in a calendar . Life ! He that can be
so saucy to call her Bess already will call her prating quean
a month hence .
They have given thee all the slip .
So , a fair riddance .
There 's three rubs gone ; I 've a clear way to th ' mistress .

You 'd need have a clear way because y 'are a bad pricker .
MISTRESS LOW-WATER
Yet if my bowl take bank , I shall go nigh
To make myself a saver ;
Here 's alley room enough : I 'll try my fortune .
I am to begin the world like a younger brother ;
I know that a bold face and a good spirit
Is all the jointure he can make a widow .
An't shall go hard , but I 'll be as rich as he ,
Or at least seem so , and that 's wealth enough ;
For nothing kills a widow 's heart so much
As a faint , bashful wooer : though he have thousands
And come with a poor water-gruel spirit
And a fish-market face , he shall ne 'er speed .
I would not have himself left a poor widower .
Faith , I 'm glad I 'm alive to commend thee , Kate . I shall be sure
now to see my commendations delivered .
I 'll put her to't , i'faith .
But soft ye , Kate .
How and she should accept of your bold kindness ?
A chief point to be thought on , by my faith .
Marry , therefore , sir , be you sure to step in ,
For fear I should shame myself and spoil all .
Well , I 'll save your credit then for once ,
But look you come there no more .
Away , I hear her coming .
I am vanish d .
How does my life , my soul , my dear sweet madam ?
I have wrong 'd your patience , made you stand too long here .
There 's no such thing , i'faith , madam ; y 'are pleas 'd to say so .
Yes , I confess I was too slow , sir .
Why , you shall make me amends for that then with a quickness in
your bed .
That were a speedy mends , sir .
Why , then you are out of my debt ; I 'll cross the book and turn
over a new leaf with you .
So with paying a small debt , I may chance run into a greater .
My faith , your credit will be the better then . There 's many a
brave gallant would be glad of such fortune , and pay use for't .
Some of them have nothing else to do ; they would be idle and 'twere
not for interest .
I promise you , widow , were I a setter-up , such is my opinion of
your payment , I durst trust you with all the ware in my shop .
I thank you for your good will ; I can have no more .
Not of me , i'faith , nor that neither , and you know
all.--Come , make but short service , widow : a kiss and to bed ;
I 'm very hungry , i'faith , wench .
What are you , sir ?
Oh , a younger brother has an excellent stomach , madam , worth a
hundred of your sons and heirs that stay their wedding stomachs
with a hot bit of a common mistress , and then come to a widow 's
bed like a flash of lightning . Y'are sure of the first of me ,
not of the five hundredth of them . I never took physic yet in
my life ; you shall have the doctor continually with them , or some
bottle for his deputy : out flies your moneys for restoratives
and strength'nings . In me 'tis sav 'd in your purse and found
in your children : they 'll get peevish pothecaries ' stuff , you
may weigh 'em by th ' ounces ; I , boys of war , brave commanders ,
that shall bear a breadth in their shoulders and a weight in their
hips , and run over a whole country with a pound o ' beef and a
biscuit in their belly . Ho , widow , my kisses are virgins , my
embraces perfect , my strength solid , my love constant , my heat
comfortable ; but to come to the point , inutterable--
But soft ye , soft ye ; because you stand so strictly
Upon your purity , I 'll put you to't , sir .
Will you swear here you never yet knew woman ?
Never , as man e 'er knew her , by this light , widow .
What , what , sir ? ' Shrew my heart , he moves me
much .
Nay , since you love to bring a man on 's knees ,
I take into the same oath thus much more ,
That y 'are the first widow , or maid , or wife
That ever I in suit of love did court
Or honestly did woo . How say you to that , widow ?
Marry , I say , sir , you had a good portion of chastity left you ,
though ill fortune run away with the rest .
That I kept for thee , widow : she 's of fortune and all her strait-bodied
daughters ; thou shalt have 't , widow .
Push , what do you mean ?
I cannot bestow 't better .
I 'll call my servants .
By my troth , you shall not , madam .
Does your worship call , sir ?
Ha , pox ! Are you peeping ?
He came in a good time ; I thank him for't .
What do you think of me ? You 're very forward , sir .
Extremity of love .
You say y 'are ignorant ;
It should not seem so surely by your play :
For aught I see , you may make one yourself ;
You need not hold the cards to any gamester .
That love should teach men ways to wrong itself !
Are these the first fruits of your boldness , sir ?
If all take after these , you may boast on 'em .
There comes few such to market among women ;
Time you were taken down , sir . Within there !
I 've lost my way again .
There 's but two paths that lead to widows ' beds ,
That 's wealth or forwardness , and I 've took the wrong one .
He marry my lady ? Why , there 's no such thought
yet .
Oh , here they are all again too !
Are you come , gentlemen ? I wish no better men .
Oh , the moon 's chang 'd now !
See you that gentleman yonder ?
Yes , sweet madam .
Then pray be witness all of you ; with this kiss
I choose him for my husband--
A pox on't !
And with this parted gold that two hearts join .
Never with chaster love than this of mine .
And those that have the hearts to come to th ' wedding ,
They shall be welcome for their former loves .
No, I thank you ; y 'ave chok 'd me already .
I never suspected mine almanac 'till now . I believe he plays
cogging John with me : I bought it at his shop ; it may learn the
more knavery by that .
Now indeed , gentlemen , I can bid you welcome ;
Before 'twas but a flourish .
Nay , so my almanac told me there should be an eclipse , but not
visible in our horizon , but about the western inhabitants of Mexicana
and California .
Well , we have no business there , sir .
Nor we have none here , sir , and so fare you well .

You save the house a good labour , gentlemen ; the fool carries
them away in a voider . Where be these fellows ?
Sir ?
Here , sir .
What 's your worship 's pleasure ?
Oh , this is something like . Take
you your ease , sir ;
Here are those now more fit to be commanded .
How few women are of thy mind ! She thinks it too
much to keep me in subjection for one day , whereas some wives
would be glad to keep their husbands in awe all days of their
lives and think it the best bargain that e 'er they made .
I 'll spare no cost for th ' wedding , some device
too ,
To show our thankfulness to wit and fortune ;
It shall be so . Run straight for one o ' th ' wits .
How , one o ' th ' wits ? I care not if I run on that account ; are
they in town think you ?
Whither runn 'st thou now ?
To an ordinary for one of the wits .
Why to an ordinary , above a tavern ?
No, I hold your best wits to be at ordinary , nothing so good in
a tavern .
And why I pray , sir ?
Because those that go to an ordinary dine better for twelve pence
than he that goes to a tavern for his five shillings , and I think
those have the best wits that can save four shillings , and fare
better too .
So , sir , all your wit then runs upon victuals .
' Tis a sign 'twill hold out the longer then .
What were you saying to me ?
Please your worship ,
I heard there came a scholar over lately
With old Sir Oliver 's lady .
Is she come?--
What is that lady ?
A good gentlewoman ,
Has been long prisoner with the enemy .
I know't too well , and joy in her release.--
Go to that house then straight , and in one labour
You may bid them , and entreat home that scholar .
It shall be done with speed , sir .
I 'll along with you ,
And see what face that scholar has brought over ;
A thin pair of parbreaking , sea-water green chops ,
I warrant you .
Since wit has pleasur 'd me ,
I 'll pleasure wit ; scholars shall fare the better .
Oh , my blessing ! I feel a hand of mercy
Lift me up out of a world of waters ,
And now sets me upon a mountain , where
The sun plays most , to cheer my heart ev'n as
It dries my limbs . What deeps I see beneath me ,
In whose falls many a nimble mortal toils
And scarce can feed himself ! The streams of fortune
' Gainst which he tugs in vain still beat him down ,
And will not suffer him , past hand to mouth ,
To lift his arm to his posterity 's blessing .
I see a careful sweat run in a ring
About his temples , but all will not do ,
For till some happy means relieve his state ,
There he must stick and bide the wrath of fate .
I see this wrath upon an uphill land ;
Oh , bless 'd are they can see their falls and stand !
How now ?
With much entreating , sir ; he 's come .
Sir , y 'are my brother ! Joys come thick together!--
Sir , when I see a scholar , pardon me ,
I am so taken with affection for him
That I must run into his arms and clasp him .
Art stands in need , sir , of such cherishers ;
I meet too few : 'twere a brave world for scholars
If half a kingdom were but of your mind , sir ;
Let ignorance and hell confound the rest .
Let it suffice , sweet sir ; you cannot think
How dearly you are welcome .
May I live
To show you service for't .
Your love , your love , sir :
We go no higher , nor shall you go lower .
Sir , I 'm bold to send for you , to request
A kindness from your wit , for some device
To grace our wedding . It shall be worth your pains ,
And something more t ' express my love to art ;
You shall not receive all in bare embracements .
Your love I thank ; but pray , sir , pardon me ,
I 've a heart says I must not grant you that .
No ? What 's your reason , sir ?
I 'm not at peace
With the lady of this house ; now you 'll excuse me :
Sh'as wrong 'd my sister , and I may not do 't .
The widow knows you not .
I never saw her face to my remembrance .
Oh , that my heart should feel her wrongs so much ,
And yet live ignorant of the injurer !
Let me persuade thee since she knows you not :
Make clear the weather ; let not griefs betray you .
I 'll tell her y 'are a worthy friend of mine ,
And so I tell her true , thou art indeed .
Sir , here she comes .
What , are you busy , sir ?
Nothing less , lady ; here 's a gentleman
Of noble parts , beside his friendship to me .
Pray , give him liberal welcome .
He 's most welcome .
The virtues of his mind will deserve largely .
Methinks his outward parts deserve as much then ;
A proper gentleman it is .
Come , worthy sir .
I follow .
Check thy blood
For fear it prove too bold to wrong thy goodness !
A wise man makes affections but his slaves ;
Break 'em in time , let 'em not master thee !
Oh , 'tis my sister 's enemy , think of that
Some speedy grief fall down upon the fire
Before it take my heart ; let it not rise
' Gainst brotherly nature , judgment , and these wrongs !
Make clear the weather !
Oh , who could look upon her face in storms !
Yet pains may work it out : griefs do but strive
To will this spark ; I 'll keep it still alive .
Faith , Sir Gilbert , forget and forgive ;
There 's all our hands to a new bargain of friendship .
Ay , and all our hearts to boot , Sir Gilbert .
Why , la , you ! There 's but four suitors left on 's in all th ' world ,
and the fifth has the widow ; if we should not be kind to one another ,
and so few on 's , i'faith , I would we were all rak 'd up in some
hole or other .
Pardon me , gentlemen , I cannot but remember
Your late disgraceful words before the widow ,
In time of my oppression .
Puh , Saturn reign 'd then , a melancholy , grumbling planet ! He
was in the third house of privy enemies , and would have bewray 'd
all our plots ; beside there was a fiery conjunction in the dragon 's
tail that spoil 'd all that e 'er we went about .
Dragon or devil , somewhat 'twas I am sure .
Why , I tell you , Sir Gilbert , we were all out of our wits in't ;
I was so mad at that time myself , I could have wish 'd an hind-quarter
of my bull out of your belly again , whereas now I care not if
you had eat tail and all . I am no niggard in the way of friendship ;
I was ever yet at full moon in good fellowship , and so you shall
find if you look into the almanac of my true nature .
Well , all 's forgiven for once ; hands apace , gentlemen .
Ye shall have two of mine to do you a kindness ; yet when they 're
both abroad , who shall look to th ' house here ?
Not only a new friendship , but a friend .
But upon this condition , gentlemen ,
You shall hear now a thing worth your revenge .
And you doubt that ,
You shall have mine beforehand ; I 've one ready :
I never go without a black oath about me .
I know the least touch of a spur in this
Will now put your desires to a false gallop ,
By all means sland 'rous in every place ,
And in all companies , to disgrace the widow ,
No matter in what rank , so it be spiteful
And worthy your revenges ; so now I.
It shall be all my study , care , and pains ,
And we can lose no labour ; all her foes
Will make such use on't that they 'll snatch it from us
Faster than we can forge it , though we keep
Four tongues at work upon't and never cease .
Then for the indifferent world , faith , they 're apter
To bid a slander welcome than a truth .
We have the odds of our side ; this in time
May grow so general as disgrace will spread
That wild dissension may divide the bed .
Excellent !
A pure revenge ; I see no dregs in't .
Let each man look to his part now , and not feed
Upon one dish all four on 's , like plain maltmen ;
For at this feast we must have several kickshaws
And delicate made dishes , that the world
May see it is a banquet finely furnish 'd .
Why , then let me alone for one of your kickshaws ;
I have thought on that already .
Prithee , how , sir ?
Marry , sir , I 'll give it out abroad that I have lain with the
widow myself , as 'tis the fashion of many a gallant to disgrace
his new mistress when he cannot have his will of her , and lie
with her name in every tavern , though he ne 'er came within a yard
of her person ; so I , being a gentleman , may say as much in that
kind as a gallant : I am as free by my father 's copy .
This will do excellent , sir .
And moreover , I 'll give the world thus much to understand beside ,
that if I had not lain with the widow in the wane of the moon ,
at one of my seven stars ' houses , when Venus was about business
of her own and could give no attendance , she had been brought
abed with two roaring boys by this time , and the Gemini being
infants , I 'd have made away with them like a stepmother , and put
mine own boys in their places .
Why , this is beyond talk ; you out-run your master .
Whoop ! Draw home next time ; here are all the old
shooters that have lost the game at pricks ! What a fair mark
had Sir Gilbert on't if he had shot home before the last arrow
came in . Methinks these show to me now for all the world like
so many lousy beggars turn 'd out of my lady 's barn , and have ne 'er
a hole to put their heads in .
Mass , here 's her ladyship 's ass ; he tells us anything .
Ho , Pickadille !
What , Sir Gilbert Lambston !
Gentlemen , outlaws all , how do you do ?
How ! What , dost call us ? How goes the world at home , lad ?
What strange news ?
This is the state of prodigals as right as can be ;
When they have spent all their means on brave feasts ,
They 're glad to scrape to a serving-man for a meal 's meat ;
So you that whilom , like four prodigal rivals ,
Could goose or capon , crane or woodcock choose ,
Now 're glad to make up a poor meal with news .
A lamentable hearing !
He 's in passion , up to the eyebrows for us .
Oh , Master Weatherwise , I blame none but you .
You are a gentleman deeply read in Pond 's Almanac ;
Methinks you should not be such a shallow fellow .
You knew this day , the twelfth of June , would come
When the sun enters into the Crab 's room ,
And all your hopes would go aside , aside .
The fool says true , i'faith , gentlemen . I knew
' Twould come all to this pass ; I 'll show't you presently .
If you had spar 'd but four of your twelve signs now ,
You might have gone to a tavern and made merry with 'em .
H'as the best moral meaning of an ass that e 'er I heard speak
with tongue ! Look you here , gentlemen . " Fifth
day , neither fish nor flesh . "
No, nor good red herring , and you look again .
" Sixth day , privily prevented . "
Marry , faugh !
" Seventh day , shrunk in the wetting . "
Nay , so will the best ware bought for love or money .
" The eighth day , over head and ears . "
By my faith , he come home in a sweet pickle then .
" The ninth day , scarce sound at heart . "
What o ' pox ail 'd it ?
" The tenth day , a courtier 's welcome . "
That 's a cup of beer , and you can get it .
" The eleventh day , stones against the wind . "
Pox of an ass ! He might have thrown 'em better .
Now the twelfth day , gentlemen , that was our day .
" Past all redemption . "
Then the devil go with't .
Now you see plainly , gentlemen , how we 're us 'd :
The calendar will not lie for no man 's pleasure .
Push , y 'are too confident in almanac posies .
Faith , so said we .
They 're mere delusions .
How ! You see how knavishly they happen , sir .
Ay , that 's because they 're foolishly believ 'd , sir .
Well , take your courses , gentlemen , without 'em , and see what
will come on't : you may wander like masterless men ; there 's ne 'er
a planet will care a half-penny for you . If they look after you ,
I 'll be hang 'd , when you scorn to bestow two pence to look after
them .
How ! A device at the wedding say 'st thou ?
Why , have none of you heard of that yet ?
' Tis the first news , i'faith , lad .
Oh , there 's a brave traveling scholar entertain 'd into the house
o ' purpose , one that has been all the world over , and some part
of Jerusalem ; h'as his chamber , his diet , and three candles allow 'd
him after supper .
By my faith , he need not complain for victuals then , whate 'er
he be .
He lies in one of the best chambers i' th ' house , bravely matted ;
and to warm his wits as much , a cup of sack and an
bottle stands just at his elbow .
He 's shrewdly hurt , by my faith , if he catch an ague of that fashion ,
I 'll be hang 'd .
He 'll come abroad anon .
Art sure on't ?
Why , he ne 'er stays a quarter of an hour in the home together .
No ? How can he study then ?
Pha , best of all , he talks as he goes , and writes as he runs ;
besides , you know 'tis death to a traveler to stand long in one
place .
It may hit right , boys ! Honest Pickadille ,
Thou wast wont to love me .
I 'd good cause , sir , then .
Thou shalt have the same still ; take
that .
Will you believe me now : I ne 'er lov 'd you better in my life than
I do at this present .
Tell me now truly ; who are the presenters ?
What parsons are employed in the device ?
Parsons ? Not any , sir . My mistress will not be at the charge ;
she keeps none but an old Welsh vicar .
Prithee , I mean , who be the speakers ?
Troth , I know none , but those that open their mouths . Here he
comes now himself ; you may ask him .
Is this he ? By my faith , one may pick a gentleman out of his
calves , and a scholar out on 's cheeks ; one may see by his looks
what 's in him . I warrant you there has ne 'er a new almanac come
out these dozen years but he has studied it over and over .
Do not reveal us now .
Because you shall be sure on't , you have given me a nine-pence
here , and I 'll give you the slip for't .
Well said ; now the fool 's pleas 'd , we may be bold .
Love is as great an enemy to wit
As ignorance to art ; I find my powers
So much employ 'd in business of my heart
That all the time 's too little to dispatch
Affairs within me . Fortune , too remiss ,
I suffer for thy slowness : had I come
Before a vow had chain 'd their souls together ,
There might have been some hope , though ne 'er so little ;
Now there 's no spark at all , nor e 'er can be ,
But dreadful ones struck from adultery .
And if my lust were smothered with her will ,
Oh , who could wrong a gentleman so kind ,
A stranger made up with a brother 's mind ?
Peace , peace , enough , let me alone
to manage it.--
A quick invention , and a happy one ,
Reward your study , sir .
Gentlemen , I thank you .
We understand your wits are in employment , sir ,
In honour of this wedding .
Sir , the gentleman
To whom that worthy lady is betroth 'd
Vouchsafes t ' accept the power of my good will in't .
I pray resolve us then , sir ,
For we 're friends that love and honour her ,
Whether your number be yet full or no ,
Of those which you make choice of for presenters .
First , 'tis so brief , because the time is so ,
We shall not trouble many ; and for those
We shall employ , the house will yield in servants .
Nay , then , under your leave and favour , sir ,
Since all your pains will be so weakly grac 'd ,
And wanting due performance lose their lustre ,
Here are four of us gentlemen , her friends ,
Both lovers of her honour and your art ,
That would be glad so to express ourselves ,
And think our service well and worthily plac 'd .
My thanks do me no grace for this large kindness ;
You make my labours proud of such presenters .
She shall not think , sir , she 's so ill belov 'd ,
But friends can quickly make that number perfect .
She 's bound t ' acknowledge it .
Only thus much , sir ,
Which will amaze her most : I 'd have 't so carried ,
As you can do 't , that neither she nor none
Should know what friends we were till all were done .
Ay , that would make the sport .
I like it well , sir .
My hand and faith amongst you gentlemen ;
It shall be so disposed of .
We are the men then .
Then look you , gentlemen : the device is single ,
Naked , and plain because the time 's so short ,
And gives no freedom to a wealthier sport ;
' Tis only , gentlemen , the four elements
In liveliest forms : earth , water , air , and fire .
Mass , and here 's four of us , too !
It fits well , sir .
This the effect : that whereas all those four
Maintain a natural opposition
And untruc 'd war , the one against the other ,
To shame their ancient envies , they should see
How well in two breasts all these do agree .
That 's in the bride and bridegroom ; I am quick , sir .
In faith , it 's pretty , sir ; I approve it well .
But see how soon my happiness and your kindness
Is cross 'd together .
Cross 'd ? I hope not so , sir .
I can employ but two of you .
How comes that , sir ?
Air and the fire should be by men presented ,
But the two other in the forms of women .
Nay , then we 're gone again ; I think these women
Were made to vex and trouble us in all shapes !
Faith , sir , you stand too nicely .
So think I , sir .
Yet when we tax ourselves , it may the better
Set off our errors , when the fine eyes judge 'em ;
But water certainly should be a woman .
By my faith , then he is gelded since I saw him last ; he was thought
to be a man once , when he got his wife with child before he was
married .
Fie , you are fishing in another stream , sir .
But now I come to yours and you go to that , sir ; I see no reason
then but fire and water should change shapes and genders .
How prove you that , sir ?
Why , there 's no reason but water should be a man , because fire
is commonly known to be a quean .
So , sir , you argue well .
Nay , more , sir : water will break in at a little crevice , so will
a man if he be not kept out ; water will undermine , so will an
informer ; water will ebb and flow , so will a gentleman ; water
will search any place , and so will a constable , as lately he did
at my seven stars for a young wench that was stole ; water will
quench fire , and so will Wat the barber ; let water
wear a codpiece-point .
Faith , gentlemen , I like your company well .
Let 's see who 'll dispute with me at the full o ' th ' moon .
No, sir ; and you be vainglorious of your talent , I 'll put you
to't once more .
I 'm for you , sir , as long as the moon keeps in this quarter .
Well , how answer you this then ? Earth and water are both bearers ,
therefore they should be women .
Why , so are porters and peddlers , and yet they are known to be
men .
I 'll give you over in time , sir ; I shall repent the bestowing
on't else .
If I that have proceeded in five and twenty such books of astronomy
should not be able to put down a scholar now in one thousand six
hundred thirty and eight , the dominical letter being G , I stood
for a goose .
Then this will satisfy you though that be a woman ;
Oceanus , the sea , that 's chief of waters ,
He wears the form of a man , and so may you .
Now I hear reason , and I may consent .
And so , though earth challenge a feminine face ,
The matter of which earth consists , that 's dust ,
The general soul of earth is of both kinds .
Fit yourselves , gentlemen , I 've enough for me .
Earth , water , air , and fire , part 'em amongst you .
Let me play air ; I was my father 's eldest son .
Ay , but this air never possess 'd the lands .
I 'm but dispos 'd to jest with you , sir ; 'tis the same my almanac
speaks on , is't not ?
That 'tis , sir .
Then leave it to my discretion to fit both the part and the person .
You shall have your desire , sir .
We 'll agree
Without your trouble now , sir . We 're not factious
Or envy one another for best parts ,
Like quarrelling actors that have passionate fits ;
We submit always to the writer 's wits .
He that commends you may do 't liberally ,
For you deserve as much as praise can show .
We 'll send to you privately .
I 'll dispatch you .
We 'll poison your device !
She must have pleasures ,
Shows , and conceits , and we disgraceful doom .
We 'll make your elements come limping home .
How happy am I in this unlook 'd-for grace ,
This voluntary kindness from these gentlemen !
' Twill set off all my labours far more pleasing
Before the widow , whom my heart calls mistress ,
But my tongue dares not second it .
How say you now , Kate ?
I like this music well , sir .
Oh , unfortunate !
Yet though a tree be guarded from my touch ,
There 's none can hinder me to love the fruit .
Nay , now we know your mind , brother , we 'll provide for you .
Oh , were it but as free as late times knew it ,
I would deserve , if all life 's wealth could do it .
Oh my reviving joy ! Thy quick 'ning presence
Makes the sad night of threescore and ten years
Sit like a youthful spring upon my blood .
I cannot make thy welcome rich enough
With all the wealth of words .
It is express 'd , sir ,
With more than can be equall 'd ; the ill store
Lies only on my side , my thanks are poor .
Bless 'd be the goodness of his mind forever
That did redeem thy life ; may it return
Upon his fortunes double ! That worthy gentleman ,
Kind Master Beveril , shower upon him , heaven ,
Some unexpected happiness to requite him
For that my joy unlook 'd for ! Oh , more kind
And juster far is a mere stranger 's goodness
Than the sophistic faith of natural sons
Here 's one could juggle with me , take up the ransom ,
He and his loose companion .
Say you me so , sir ?
I 'll eat hard eggs for that trick .
Spend the money ,
And bring me home false news , and empty pockets !
In that young gallant 's tongue there you were dead
Ten weeks before this day , had not this merchant
Brought first the truth in words , yourself in substance .
Pray let me stay you here ere you proceed , sir .
Did he report me dead , say you ?
Else you live not .
See now , sir , you may lay your blame too rashly
When nobody look 'd after it ; let me tell you , sir ,
A father 's anger should take great advice
Ere it condemn flesh of so dear a price .
He 's no way guilty yet , for that report
The general tongue of all the country spread ,
For being remov 'd far off , I was thought dead .
Can my faith now be taken into favour , sir ?
Is't worthy to be trusted ?
No, by my troth , is't not ;
' Twould make shift to spend another ransom yet .
Well sir , I must confess y 'ave here dealt well with me ;
And what is good in you , I love again .
Now am I half ways in , just to the girdle ,
But the worst part 's behind .
Marry , I fear me , sir ,
This weather is too glorious to hold long .
I see no cloud to interpose it , sir ,
If you place confidence in what I have told you .
Nay , 'tis clear sky on that side ; would 'twere so
All over his obedience . I see that ,
And so does this good gentleman .
Do you , sir ?
That makes his honesty doubtful .
I pray , speak , sir .
The truth of your last kindness makes me bold with you .
The knight , your husband , madam , can best speak ;
He truliest can show griefs whose heart they break .
I 'm sorry yet for more ; pray let me know't , sir ,
That I may help to chide him , though 'twould grieve me .
Why , then prepare for't . You came over now
In the best time to do 't you could pick out ;
Not only spent my money , but to blind me ,
He and his wicked instrument--
Aside Now he fiddles me !
Brings home a minion here , by great chance known ,
Told me she was his sister ; she proves none .
This was unkindly done , sir . Now I 'm sorry
My good opinion lost itself upon you ;
You are not the same son I left behind me ;
More grace took him . Oh , let me end in time
For fear I should forget myself and chide him !
Where is she , sir ? Though he beguil 'd your eyes ,
He cannot deceive mine ; we 're now too hard for him .
For since our first unfortunate separation ,
I 've often seen the would that were true--
By many a happy accident , many a one ,
But never durst acknowledge her for mine own ,
And therein stood my joys distress 'd again .
You rehearse miseries , wife . Call the maid down .
She 's been too often down to be now called so ;
She 'll lie down shortly and call somebody up .
He 's now to deal with one , sir , that knows truth :
He must be sham 'd or quit ; there 's no mean saves him .
I hear her come .
You see how hard 'tis now
To redeem good opinion being once gone ;
Be careful then , and keep it when 'tis won .
Now see me take a poison with great joy ,
Which but for thy sake , I should swoon to touch .
What new affliction ? Am I set to sale
For any one that bids most shame for me ?
Look you ! Do you see what stuff they 've brought me home here ?
Oh , bless her , eternal powers ! My life , my comforts ,
My nine-years ' grief , but everlasting joy now !
Thrice welcome to my heart ; 'tis she
indeed .
What , is it ?
I 'm unfit to carry a ransom !
Down on your knees to save your belly harmless ;
Ask blessing , though you never mean to use it ,
But give 't away presently to a beggar-wench .
My faith is blemish 'd ; I 'm no man of trust , sir .
Rise with a mother 's blessing .
All this while
Sh'as rise with a son 's .
But soft ye , soft ye , wife :
I pray take heed you place your blessing right now .
This honest Dutchman here told me he saw her
At Antwerp in an inn .
True , she was so , sir .
Sir , 'tis my quality what I speak once
I affirm ever : in that inn I saw her ;
That lets her not to be your daughter now .
Oh , sir , is't come to that ?
Here 's joys ne 'er dream 'd on !
Oh , Master Sunset , I am at the rising
Of my refulgent happiness ! Now , son Sandfield ,
Once more and ever !
I am proud on't , sir .
Pardon me , boy , I have wrong 'd thy faith too much .
Now may I leave my shell and peep my head forth .
Where is this Savorwit , that honest whoreson ,
That I may take my curse from his knave 's shoulders ?
Oh , sir , I feel you at my very blade here ;
Your curse is ten stone weight and a pound over .
Come , thou'rt a witty varlet and a trusty .
You shall still find me a poor , faithful fellow , sir ,
If you have another ransom to send over
Or daughter to find out .
I 'll do thee right , boy .
I ne 'er yet knew thee but speak honest English ;
Marry , in Dutch I found thee a knave lately .
That was to hold you but in play a little
Till hither truths came over and I strong .
You shall ne 'er find me a knave in mine own tongue ;
I have more grace in me : I go out of England
Still when I take such courses ; that shows modesty , sir .
Anything full of wit and void of harm
I give thee pardon for , so was that now .
Faith , now I 'm quit , I find myself the nimbler
To serve you so again , and my will 's good
Like one that lately shook off his old irons ,
And cuts a purse at bench to deserve new ones .
Since it holds all the way so fortunate still ,
And strikes so even with my first belief ,
This is the gentleman , wife , young Master Sandfield here ,
A man of worthy parts , beside his lands ,
Whom I make choice of for my daughter 's bed .
But he 'll make choice there of another bedfellow .
I wish 'em both the happiness of love , sir .
' Twas spoke like a good lady ! And your memory
Can reach it , wife , but 'tis so long ago too ,
Old Master Sunset he had a young daughter
When you unluckily left England so ,
And much about the age of our girl there ,
For both were nurs 'd together .
' Tis so fresh
In my remembrance now y 'have waken 'd it ,
As if twelve years were but a twelve-hours ' dream .
That girl is now a proper gentlewoman ,
As fine a body , wife , as e 'er was measured
With an indenture cut in farthing steaks .
Oh , say not so , Sir Oliver ; you shall pardon me , sir .
I'faith , sir , you are too blame .
Sings , dances , plays ,
Touches an instrument with a motherly grace .
' Tis your own daughter that you mean that by .
There 's open Dutch indeed , and he could take it !
This wench , under your leave--
You have my love in't .
Is my son 's wife that shall be .
Thus I 'd hold with't ;
Is your son 's wife that should be Master Sandfield 's .
I come in happy time to a feast of marriages .
And now you put 's i' th ' mind , the hour draws on
At the new-married widow 's ; there we 're look 'd for .
There will be entertainments , sports , and banquets ;
There these young lovers shall clap hands together :
The seed of one feast shall bring forth another .
Well said , Sir Oliver .
Y'are a stranger , sir ,
Your welcome will be best .
Good sir , excuse me .
You shall along , i'faith ; you must not refuse me .
Oh , mother , these new joys that sets my soul up ,
Which had no means nor any hope of any ,
Has brought me now so far in debt to you ,
I know not which way to begin to thank you .
I am so lost in all , I cannot guess
Which of the two my service most constrains ,
Your last kind goodness or your first dear pains .
Love is a mother 's duty to a son ,
As a son 's duty is both love and fear .
I owe you a poor life , madam , that 's all :
Pray call for't when you please ; it shall be ready for you .
Make much on't , sir , till then .
If butter 'd sack will .
Methinks the more I look upon her , son ,
The more thy sister 's face runs in my mind .
Belike she 's somewhat like her ; it makes the better , madam .
Was Antwerp , say you , the first place you found her in ?
Yes , madam . Why do you ask ?
Whose daughter were you ?
I know not rightly whose , to speak truth , madam .
The mother of her was a good twigger the whilst .
No ? With whom were you brought up then ?
With those , madam ,
To whom , I 've often heard , the enemy sold me .
What 's that ?
Too often have I heard this piteous story
Of a distressed mother I had once ,
Whose comfortable sight I lost at sea ;
But then the years of childhood took from me
Both the remembrance of her and the sorrows .
Oh , I begin to feel her in my blood !
My heart leaps to be at her . What was that mother ?
Some said an English lady , but I know not .
What 's thy name ?
Grace .
May it be so in heaven ,
For thou art mine on earth . Welcome , dear
child ,
Unto thy father 's house , thy mother 's arms ,
After thy foreign sorrows .
' Twill prove gallant .
What , son ! Such earnest work ; I bring thee joy now
Will make the rest show nothing , 'tis so glorious .
Why , 'tis not possible , madam , that man 's happiness
Should take a greater height than mine aspires .
No, now you shall confess it ; this shall quit thee
From all fears present or hereafter doubts
About this business .
Give me that , sweet mother .
Here , take her then , and set thine arms a-work ;
There needs no 'fection , 'tis indeed thy sister .
My sister !
Cuds me , I feel the razor !
Why , how now , son ? How comes a change so soon ?
Oh , I beseech you , mother , wound me anywhere
But where you pointed last . That 's present death !
Devise some other miserable torment ,
Though ne 'er so pitiless , and I 'll run and meet it .
Some way more merciful let your goodness think on
May steal away my joys , but save my soul !
I 'll willingly restore back every one
Upon that mild condition ; anything
But what you spake last will be comfortable .
Y'are troubled with strange fits in England here .
Your first suit to me did entreat me hardly
To say 'twas she , to have old wrath appeas 'd ,
And now 'tis known your sister , y 'are not pleas 'd .
How should I show myself ?
Say 'tis not she .
Shall I deny my daughter ?
Oh , you kill me
Beyond all tortures !
Why do you deal thus with me ?
She is my wife ! I married her at Antwerp ;
I have known the way unto her bed these three months .
And that 's too much by twelve weeks for a sister .
I understand you now , too soon , too plain .
Oh , mother , if you love my peace forever ,
Examine her again , find me not guilty .
' Tis now too late , her words make that too true .
Her words ? Shall bare words overthrow a soul ?
A body is not cast away so lightly .
How can you know 'tis she ? Let sense decide it ;
She then so young , and both so long divided .
She tells me the sad story .
Does that throw me ?
Many a distress may have the face of yours
That never was kin to you .
But , however , sir ,
I trust you are not married .
Here 's the witness ,
And all the wealth I had with her ; this ring
That join 'd our hearts together .
Oh , too clear now !
Thou 'st brought in evidence to o 'erthrow thyself ;
Had no one word been spoke , only this shown ,
' T had been enough to approv 'd her for mine own .
See here , two letters that begun my name
Before I knew thy father ; this I gave her ,
And , as a jewel , fasten 'd to her ear .
Pardon me , mother , that you find it stray ;
I kept it till I gave my heart away .
Oh , to what mountain shall I take my flight
To hide the monster of my sin from sight ?
I 'll to Wales presently ; there 's the best hills
To hide a poor knave in .
Oh , heap not desperation upon guilt !
Repent yet and all 's sav 'd ; 'twas but hard chance :
Amongst all sins , heaven pities ignorance .
She 's still the first that has her pardon sign 'd ;
All sins else see their faults , she 's only blind .
Go to thy chamber , pray , leave off , and win ;
One hour 's repentance cures a twelve-month 's sin .
Oh , my distressed husband , my dear brother !
Oh , Savorwit ! Never came sorrow yet
To mankind like it ; I 'm so far distress 'd ,
I 've no time left to give my heart attendance ,
Too little all to wait upon my soul !
Before this tempest came , how well I stood ,
Full in the beams of blessedness and joy !
The memory of man could never say
So black a storm fell in so bright a day .
I am that man that ev'n life surfeits of ;
Or if to live , unworthy to be seen
By the savage eyesight ! Give 's thy hand ;
Commend me to thy prayers .
Next time I say 'em .
Farewell , my honest breast , that cravest no more
Than possible kindness ; that I 've found thee large in ,
And I must ask no more : there wit must stay ;
It cannot pass where fate stops up the way .
Joy thrive with thee ; I 'll never see thee more .
What 's that , sir ?
Pray come back , and bring those words with you ;
You shall not carry 'em so out of my company .
There 's no last refuge when your father knows it ;
There 's no such need on't yet : stay but till then ,
And take one with you that will imitate you
In all the desperate onsets man dare think on .
Were it to challenge all the wolves in France
To meet at one set battle , I 'd be your half in't ;
All beasts of venom , what you had a mind to ,
Your part should be took still . For such a day
Let 's keep ourselves in heart , then am I for you .
In the meantime , to beat off all suspicion ,
Let 's to the bridehouse too ; here 's my petition .
Thou hast a learning art when all hopes fly .
Let one night waste ; there 's time enough left to die .
A minute 's as good as a thousand year , sir ,
To pink a man 's heart like a summer suit .
Bestir your bones nimbly , you ponderous , beef-buttock 'd knaves ;
what a number of lazy hinds do I keep company withal ! Where 's
the flesh-colour , velvet cushion now for my lady 's pease-porridge-tawny-satin
bum ? You attendants upon revels !
You can prate and domineer well because you have a privileged
place , but I 'd fain see you set your hand to't !
Oh , base bone-pickers , I set my hand to't ! When did you e 'er
see a gentleman set his hand to anything unless it were to a sheepskin
and receive a hundred pound for his pains ?
And afterward lie in the Counter for his pleasure .
Why , true , sir ; 'tis for his pleasure indeed , for , spite of all
their teeths , he may lie i' th ' hole when he list .
Marry , and should for me .
Ay , thou wouldst make as good a bawd as the best jailor of them
all ; I know that .
How , fool !
Hark ! I must call you knave within ; 'tis but staying somewhat
the longer for't .
This fair assembly is most freely welcome .
ALL
Thanks to you , good sir .
Come , my long-wish 'd-for madam ,
You and this worthy stranger take best welcome ;
Your freedom is a second feast to me .
How is't with my brother ?
The fit holds him still ;
Nay , love 's more violent .
' Las , poor gentleman !
I would he had my office without money ;
If he should offer any , I 'd refuse it
I have the letter ready ; he 's worthy
Of a place that knows how to use it .
That 's well said.--
Come ladies , gentlemen ; Sir Oliver , good :
Seat yourselves ; shall we be found unreadiest ?
What is yon gentleman with the funeral face there ?
Methinks that look does ill become a bride-house .
Who does your worship mean , sir ? My son Philip ?
I am sure he had ne 'er less reason to be sad .
Why are you sad , son Philip ?
How , sir , sad ?
You shall not find it so , sir .
Take heed he do not then .
You must beware how you carry your face in this company ; as far
as I can see , that young bridegroom has hawk 's eyes : he 'll go
nigh to spell sister in your face ; if your nose were but crooked
enough to serve for an S , he 'd find an eye presently , and then
he has more light for the rest .
I 'll learn then to dissemble .
Nay , and you be to learn that now , you 'll ne 'er sit in a branch 'd-velvet
gown as long as you live ! You should have took that at nurse
before your mother wean 'd you ; so do all those that prove great
children and batten well .
Peace , here comes a scholar indeed ; he has learn 'd it , I warrant
you .
Kind sir , you 're welcome ; you take all the pains , sir .
I wish they were but worthy of the grace
Of your fair presence and this choice assembly .
Here is an abstract , madam , of what 's shown ,
Which I commend to your favour .
Thank you for't , sir .
I would I durst present my love as boldly .
My honest brother !
Look thee here , sweetheart .
What 's there , sweet madam ?
Music , and we 're ready .
The flame of zeal--
The wicked fire of lust ,
Does now spread heat through water , air , and dust .
The wheel of time--
The devil set fire o ' th ' distaff .
I that was wont in elder times to pass
For a bright angel , so they call 'd me then ,
Now so corrupted with the upstart fires
Of avarice , luxury , and inconstant heats ,
Struck from the bloods of cunning , clap-fall 'n daughters ,
Night-walking wives , but , most , libidinous widows ,
That I , that purify ev'n gold itself ,
Have the contemptible dross thrown in my face ,
And my bright name walk common in disgrace .
How am I us 'd o ' late that I am so handled ,
Thrust into alleys , hospitals , and tubs !
I was once a name of comfort , warm 'd great houses
When charity was landlord ; I have given welcome
To forty russet yeomen at a time
In a fair Christmas-hall . How am I chang 'd !
The chimneys are swept up , the hearth as cold
As the forefathers ' charity in the son .
All the good hospitable heat now turns
To my young landlord 's lust , and there it burns .
Rich widows , that were wont to choose by gravity
Their second husbands , not by tricks of blood ,
Are now so taken with loose Aretine flames
Of nimble wantonness and high-fed pride
They marry now but the third part of husbands ,
Boys , smooth-fac 'd catamites , to fulfill their bed ,
As if a woman should a woman wed .
These are the fires o ' late : my brightness darks
And fills the world so full of beggarly sparks .
Heart ! How am I disgrac 'd ! What rogue should
this be ?
By my faith , Monsieur Fire , y 'are a hot whoreson !
I fear my brother is beside his wits ;
He would not be so senseless to rail thus else .
After this heat , you madams fat and fair ,
Open your casements wide and take in air ;
But not that air false women make up oaths with ,
No, nor that air gallants perfume their clothes with :
I am that air that keeps about the clouds .
None of my kindred was smelt out in crowds ;
Not any of our house was ever tainted
When many a thousand of our foes have fainted .
Yet some there are that be my chief polluters ,
Widows that falsify their faith to suitors
And will give fair words when the sign 's in Cancer ,
But , at the next remove , a scurvy answer ;
Come to the poor men 's houses , eat their banquet ,
And at night with a boy toss 'd in a blanket .
Nay , shall I come more near ? Perhaps at noon ,
For here I find a spot full in the moon .
I know youth 's trick ; what 's she that can withstand it
When Mercury reigns , my lady 's chamber planet ?
He that believes a widow 's words shall fail
When Venus ' gown-skirts sweeps the Dragon 's tail .
Fair weather the first day she makes to any ,
The second cloudy , and the third day rainy ;
The fourth day a great storm , lightning and thunder :
A bolt strikes the suitor , a boy keeps her under .
Life ! These are some counterfeit slaves crept
in their rooms ,
A' purpose for disgrace ; they shall all share with me .
Heart ! Who the devil should these be ?
My faith , gentlemen ,
Air has perfum 'd the room well !
So methinks , madam .
A man may smell her meaning two rooms off ,
Though his nose wanted reparations
And the bridge left at Shoreditch as a pledge
For in a bleaking-house .
Life ! What should be his meaning in't ?
I wonder .
Methinks this room should yet retain such heat
Struck out from the first ardour and so glow yet ,
You should desire my company , wish for water ,
That offers here to serve your several pipes
Without constraint of mill or death of water house .
What if I sprinkled on the widow 's cheeks
A few cool drops to lay the guilty heat
That flashes from her conscience to her face ;
Would't not refresh her shame ? From such as she
I first took weakness and inconstancy ;
I sometimes swell above my banks and spread .
They 're commonly with child before they 're wed ;
In me the sirens sing before they play ,
In her more witchcraft , for her smiles betray .
Where I 'm least seen , there my most danger lies ,
So in those parts hid most from a man 's eyes :
Her heart , her love , or what may be more close .
I know no mercy , she thinks that no loss .
In her , poor gallants ! Pirates thrive in me ;
I help to cast away , and so does she .
Nay , and you can hold nothing , sweet sir Water ,
I 'll wash my hands a' you ever hereafter .
Earth stands for a full point : me you should hire
To stop the gaps of water , air , and fire .
I love muck well , but your first husband better :
Above his soul he lov 'd it , as his end
Did fearfully witness it ; at his last gasp
His spirit flam 'd , as it forsook his breast ,
And left the sparkles quarreling 'bout his lips .
Now of such metal the devil makes him whips ;
He shall have gold enough to glut his soul :
And as for earth , I 'll stop his crane 's throat full .
The wealth he left behind him , most men know ,
He wrung inconscionably from the rights
Of poor men 's livings ; he drunk dry their brows .
That liquor has a curse , yet nothing sweeter ;
When your posterity drinks , then 'twill taste bitter .
And now to vex , 'gainst nature , form , rule , place ,
See once four warring elements all embrace .
How ! Sir Gilbert Lambston , Master Overdon !
All our old suitors ! You have took pains , my masters .
We made a vow we 'd speak our minds to you .
And I think we 're as good as our words , though it cost some of
our purses : I owe money for the clouds yet , I care not who knows
it ; the planets are sufficient enough to pay the painter , and
I were dead .
Who are you , sir ?
Your most unworthy servant .
Pardon me , is't you , sir ?
My disgrace urg 'd my wit to take some form
Wherein I might both best and properliest
Discover my abusers and your own ,
And show you some content before y ' had none .
Sir , I owe much both to your care and love ,
And you shall find your full requital worthy .
Was this the plot now your poor envy works
out ?
I do revenge myself with pitying on you .
Take Fire into the buttery , he has most
need on't ;
Give Water some small beer , too good for him ;
Air , you may walk abroad like a fortune-teller ;
But take down Earth and make him drink i' th ' cellar .
The best revenge that could be .
I commend you , madam .
I thought they were some such sneakers .
The four suitors ! And here was a mess of mad elements !
Lights , more lights there ! Where be these blue-coats ?
You know your lodgings , gentlemen , tonight .
' Tis bounty makes bold guests , madam .
Good rest , lady .
A most contentful night begin a health , madam ,
To your long joys , and may the years go round with't .
As many thanks as you have wish 'd 'em hours , sir ,
Take to your lodging with you .
A general rest to all .
I 'm excepted .
Take in another to you then ; there 's
room enough
In that exception , faith , to serve us both .
The dial of my sleep goes by your eyes .
Now , like a greedy usurer alone ,
I sum up all the wealth this day has brought me ,
And thus I hug it .
Prithee !
Thus , I kiss it .
I ca n't abide these kissings .
How , sir ? Not ?
I 'll try that sure ; I 'll kiss you out of that humour .
Push , by my troth , I cannot .
What cannot you , sir ?
Not toy , nor bill and imitate house pigeons ;
A married man must think of other matters .
How , other matters , sir ? What other matters ?
Why , are there no other matters that belong to't ?
Do you think y 'have married only a cock-sparrow
And fit but for one business like a fool ?
You shall not find it so .
You can talk strangely , sir .
Come , will you to bed ?
No, faith , will not I.
What , not to bed , sir ?
And I do , hang me ! Not to bed with you !
How , not to bed with me ! Sir , with whom else ?
Why , am not I enough to lie with myself ?
Is that the end of marriage ?
No, by my faith ,
' Tis but the beginning , yet death is the end on't ,
Unless some trick come i' th ' middle and dash all .
Were you so forward lately and so youthful
That scarce my modest strength could save me from you ,
And are you now so cold ?
I 've thought on't since .
It was but a rude part in me , i'faith ,
To offer such bold tricks to any woman ,
And by degrees I shall well break myself from't ;
I feel myself well chasten 'd since that time ,
And not the third part now so loosely minded .
Oh , when one sees their follies , 'tis a comfort !
My very thoughts take more staid years upon 'em .
Oh , marriage is such a serious divine thing !
It makes youth grave and sweetly nips the spring .
If I had chose a gentleman for care
And worldly business , I had ne 'er took you ;
I had the offers of enough more fit
For such employment : I chose you for love ,
Youth , and content of heart , and not for troubles ;
You are not ripe for them . After y 'have spent
Some twenty years in dalliance , youth 's affairs ,
Then take a book in your hand and sum up cares ;
As for wealth now , you know that 's got to your hands .
But had I known 't had been so wrongfully got ,
As I heard since , you should have had free leave
To have made choice of another master for't .
Why , can that trouble you ?
It may too soon . But go ;
My sleeps are sound : I love not to be started
With an ill conscience at the fall of midnight ,
And have mine eyes torn ope with poor men 's curses .
I do not like the fate on't : 'tis still apt
To breed unrest , dissension , wild debate ,
And I 'm the worst at quarrels upon earth ,
Unless a mighty injury should provoke me .
Get you to bed , go .
Not without you , in troth , sir .
If you could think how much you wrong yourself
In my opinion of you , you would leave me now
With all the speed you might ; I like you worse
For this fond heat , and drink in more suspicion of you .
You high-fed widows are too cuing people
For a poor gentleman to come simply to .
What 's that , sir ?
You may make a youth on him ;
' Tis at your courtesy , and that 's ill trusted .
You could not want a friend beside a suitor
To sit in your husband 's gown and look over your writings .
What 's this ?
I say there is a time when women
Can do too much and understand too little .
Once more , to bed ; I 'd willingly be a father
To no more noses than I got myself ,
And so good night to you .
Now I see the infection .
A yellow poison runs through the sweet spring
Of his fair youth already ; 'tis distracted ,
Jealous of that which thought yet never acted.--
Oh , dear sir ! On my knees , I swear to thee--
I prithee use them in thy private chamber
As a good lady should ; spare 'em not there ,
' Twill do thee good . Faith , none 'twill do thee here .
Have I yet married poverty and miss 'd
love ?
What fortune has my heart ? That 's all I crav 'd ,
And that lies now a-dying ; it has took
A speeding poison , and I 'm ignorant how :
I never knew what beggary was till now .
My wealth yields me no comfort in this plight ;
Had want but brought me love , I 'd happen 'd right .
So , this will serve now for a preparative
To ope the pores of some dislike at first ;
The physic will pay 't home .
How dost thou , sir ?
How goes the work ?
Your brother has the letter .
I find no stop in't then ; it moves well hitherto .
Did you convey it closely ?
He ne 'er set eye of me .
I cannot read too often .
Peace , to your office .
What blessed fate took pity of my heart ,
But with her presence to relieve me thus ?
All the large volumes that my time hath master 'd
Are not so precious to adorn my spirit
As these few lines are to enrich my mind .
I thirst again to drink of the same fountain .
" Kind Sir , I found your care and love so
much in the performance of a little , wherein your wit and art
had late employment , that I dare now trust your bosom with business
of more weight and eminence . Little thought the world that since
the wedding dinner all my mirth was but dissembled , and seeming
joys but counterfeit . The truth to you , sir , is , I find so little
signs of content in the bargain I made i' th ' morning that I began
to repent before evening prayer , and to show some fruits of his
willful neglect and wild disposition , more than the day could
bring forth to me , h'as now forsook my bed ; I know no cause for't . "
But I 'll be sworn I do .
" Being thus distress 'd , sir , I desire your
comfortable presence and counsel , whom I know to be of worth and
judgment , that a lady may safely impart her griefs to you , and
commit 'em to the virtues of commiseration and secrecy . Your
unfortunate friend , The Widow-wife . I have took order for your
private admittance with a trusty servant of mine own , whom I have
plac 'd at my chamber door to attend your coming . "
He shall not wait too long and curse my slowness !
I would you 'd come away then .
How much am I beguil 'd in that young gentleman !
I would have sworn had been the perfect abstract
Of honesty and mildness ; 'tis not so .
I pardon you , sweet brother ; there 's no hold
Of what you speak now : you 're in Cupid 's pound .
Bless 'd be the secret hand that brought thee hither ;
But the dear hand that writ it , ten times bless 'd !
That 's I still ; h'as bless 'd me now ten times at twice .
Away ; I hear him coming .
Strike it sure now .
I warrant thee , sweet Kate ; choose your best--
Who 's there ?
Oh sir , is't you ? Y'are welcome then ;
My lady still expects you , sir .
Who 's with her ?
Not any creature living , sir .
Drink that ;
I 've made thee wait too long .
It does not seem so now , sir .
Sir , if a man tread warily as any
Wise man will , how often may he come
To a lady 's chamber and be welcome to her !
Thou giv'st me learned counsel for a closet .
Make use on't , sir , and you shall find no loss in't .
So , you are surely in , and you must under .
Pardon my rude disturbance , my wrongs urge it ;
I did but try the plainness of her mind ,
Suspecting she dealt cunningly with my youth ,
And told her the first night I would not know her ;
But minding to return , I found the door
Warded suspiciously , and I heard a noise ,
Such as fear makes , and guiltiness at th ' approaching
Of an unlook 'd-for husband .
This is strange , sir .
Behold , it 's barr 'd ; I must not be kept out !
There is no reason , sir .
I 'll be resolv 'd in't .
If you be sons of honour , follow me !
Then must I stay behind , for I think I was begot i' th ' woodyard ,
and that makes everything go so hard with me .
That 's he ! Be sure on him !
Be not so furious , sir .
She whispered to him to slip into her closet .
What , have I taken you ? Is not my dream true now ?
Unmerciful adulteress , the first night !
Nay , good sir , patience !
Give me the villain 's heart ,
That I may throw 't into her bosom quick ;
There let the lecher pant !
Nay , sweet sir !
Pardon me ; his life 's too little for me .
How am I wrongfully sham 'd ! Speak your intent , sir ,
Before this company ; I pursue no pity .
This is a fine , thievish juggling , gentlemen .
She asks her mate that shares in guilt with her .
Too gross , too gross !
Rash mischief !
Treacherous sir ,
Did I for this cast a friend 's arm about thee ,
Gave thee the welcome of a worthy spirit ,
And lodg 'd thee in my house , nay , entertain 'd thee
More like a natural brother than a stranger ,
And have I this reward ? Perhaps the pride
Of thy good parts did lift thee to this impudence .
Let her make much on 'em ; she gets none of me .
Because thou'rt deeply read in most books else ,
Thou wouldst be so in mine ;
there it stands for thee :
Turn o 'er the leaves , and where you left , go forward ;
To me , it shall be like the book of fate ,
Ever clasp 'd up .
Oh , dear sir , say not so .
Nay , I 'll swear more : forever I refuse her ;
I 'll never set a foot into her bed ,
Never perform the duty of man to her
So long as I have breath .
What an oath was there , sir ! Call 't again .
I knew by amorous sparks struck from their eyes
The fire would appear shortly in a blaze ,
And now it flames indeed . Out of my house ,
And take your gentleman of good parts along with you !
That shall be all your substance ; he can live
In any emperor 's court in Christendom !
You know what you did , wench , when you chose him
To thrust out me ; you have no politic love !
You are to learn to make your market , you !
You can choose wit , a burden light and free ,
And leave the grosser element with me ,
Wealth , foolish trash , I thank you . Out of my doors !
Nay , good sir , hear her .
LADY TWILIGHT , SUNSET
Sweet sir !
Pray , to your chambers , gentlemen ; I should be here
Master of what is mine .
Hear her but speak , sir .
What can she speak but woman 's common language ?
She 's sorry and asham 'd for't ; that helps nothing .
Sir , since it is the hard hap of my life
To receive injury where I plac 'd my love--
Why , la , I told you what escapes she 'd have !
Nay , pray , sir , hear her forward .
Let our parting
Be full as charitable as our meeting was ,
That the pale , envious world , glad of the food
Of others ' miseries , civil dissensions ,
And nuptial strifes , may not feed fat with ours ;
But since you are resolv 'd so willfully
To leave my bed and ever to refuse me ,
As by your rage I find it your desire ,
Though all my actions deserve nothing less ,
Here are our friends , men both of worth and wisdom ,
Place so much power in them to make an evenness
Between my peace and yours . All my wealth within doors
In gold and jewels lie in those two caskets
I lately led you to , the value of which
Amounts to some five thousand apiece ;
Exchange a charitable hand with me ,
And take one casket freely . Fare thee well , sir .
How say you to that now ?
Troth , I thank her , sir .
Are not both mine already ? You shall wrong me
And then make satisfaction with mine own ?
I cannot blame you , a good course for you .
I know 'twas not my luck to be so happy ;
My miseries are no starters : when they come ,
Stick longer by me .
Nay , but give me leave , sir ;
The wealth comes all by her .
So does the shame ,
Yet that 's most mine ; why should not that be too ?
Sweet sir , let us rule so much with you :
Since you intend an obstinate separation ,
Both from her bed and board , give your consent
To some agreement reasonable and honest .
Must I deal honestly with her lust ?
Nay , good sir .
Why , I tell you , all the wealth her husband left her
Is not of power to purchase the dear peace
My heart has lost in these adulterous seas ;
Yet , let her works be base , mine shall be noble .
That 's the best word of comfort I heard yet .
Friends may do much . Go , bring those caskets forth .
I hate her sight ; I 'll leave her , though I lose by 't .
Spoke like a noble gentleman , i'faith !
I 'll honour thee for this .
Oh , cursed man !
Must thy rash heat force this division ?
You shall have free leave now , without all fear ;
You shall not need oil 'd hinges , privy passages ,
Watchings , and whisperings : take him boldly to you .
Oh , that I had that freedom , since my shame
Puts by all other fortunes , and owns him
A worthy gentleman . If this cloud were past him ,
I 'd marry him , were 't but to spite thee only ,
So much I hate thee now .
Here come the caskets , sir ; hold your good mind now ,
And we shall make a virtuous end between you .
Though nothing less she merit but a curse ,
That might still hang upon her and consume her still ,
As 't has been many a better woman 's fortune
That has deserv 'd less vengeance and felt more ,
Yet my mind scorns to leave her shame so poor .
Nobly spoke still .
This strikes me into music ; ha , ha !
Parting of goods before the bodies join ?
This 'tis to marry beardless , domineering boys ! I knew 'twould
come to this pass . Well fare a just almanac yet , for now is Mercury
going into the second house near unto Ursa Major , that great hunks ,
the Bear at the bridge-foot in heaven , which shows horrible bear
baitings in wedlock ; and the sun near ent 'ring into th ' Dog sets
'em all together by th ' ears .
You see what 's in't ?
I think 'tis as I left it .
Then do but gage your faith to this assembly
That you will ne 'er return more to molest me ,
But rest in all revenges full appeas 'd
And amply satisfied with that half my wealth ,
And take 't as freely as life wishes health .
La , you , sir ; come , come , faith , you shall swear that .
Nay , gentlemen , for your sakes , now I 'll deal fairly with her .
I would we might see that , sir .
I could set her free ,
But now I think on't , she deserves it not .
Nay , do not check your goodness ; pray , sir , on with't .
I could release her ere I parted with her ,
But 'twere a courtesy ill plac 'd , and set her
At as free liberty to marry again ,
As you all know she was before I knew her .
What , couldst thou , sir ?
But 'tis too good a blessing for her .
Up with the casket , sirrah !
Oh , sir , stay !
I have nothing to say to you .
Do you hear , sir ?
Pray , let 's have one word more with you for our money .
Since y 'have expos 'd me to all shame and sorrow
And made me fit but for one hope and fortune
Bearing my former comforts away with you ,
Show me a parting charity but in this :
For all my losses , pay me with that freedom ,
And I shall think this treasure as well given
As ever 'twas ill got .
I might afford it you
Because I never mean to be more troubled with you ;
But how shall I be sure of the honest use on't ,
How you 'll employ that liberty ? Perhaps sinfully ,
In wantonness unlawful , and I answer for't ;
So I may live a bawd to your loose works still
In giving 'em first vent . Not I , shall pardon me ;
I 'll see you honestly join 'd ere I release you .
I will not trust you for the last trick you play 'd me ;
Here 's your old suitors .
Now we thank you , sir .
My almanac warns me from all cuckoldy conjunctions .
Be but commander of your word now , sir ,
And before all these gentlemen , our friends ,
I 'll make a worthy choice .
Fly not ye back now .
I 'll try thee once . I am married to another ;
There 's thy release !
Hoyda ! There 's a release with a witness !
Thou'rt free , sweet wench .
Married to another !
Then in revenge to thee ,
To vex thine eyes , cause thou hast mock 'd my heart ,
And with such treachery repaid my love ,
This is the gentleman I embrace and choose .
Oh , torment to my blood , mine enemy !
None else to make thy choice of but the man
From whence my shame took head ?
' Tis done to quit thee .
Thou that wrong 'st woman 's love , her hate can fit thee .
Brave wench , i'faith ! Now thou hast an honest gentleman ,
Rid of a swaggering knave , and there 's an end on't .
A man of good parts , this t 'other had nothing .
Life , married to another !
Oh , brave rascal with two wives !
Nay , and our women be such subtle animals , I 'll lay wait at the
carrier 's for a country chambermaid and live still a bachelor .
When wives are like almanacs , we may have every year a new one ,
then I 'll bestow my money on 'em ; in the meantime , I 'll give 'em
over and ne 'er trouble my almanac about 'em .
I come in a good time to see you hang 'd , sir ,
And that 's my comfort . Now , I 'll tickle you , sir .
You make me laugh indeed .
Sir , you remember
How cunningly you chok 'd me at the banquet
With a fine bawdy letter ?
Your own fist , sir .
I 'll read the statute book to you now for't .
Turn to the act in
There lies a halter for your windpipe .
Fie , no!
Faith , but you 'll find it so , sir , an't be followed .
So says my almanac , and he 's a true man .
Look you : " The thirteenth day , work for
the hangman . "
The fourteenth day , make haste ; 'tis time you were there then !
How , is the book so saucy to tell me so ?
Sir , I must tell you now , but without gall ,
The law would hang you if married to another .
You can but put me to my book , sweet brother ,
And I 've my neck-verse perfect , here and here .
Heaven give thee eternal joy , my dear , sweet brother !
Who 's here ?
Oh , devil ! Herself ! Did she betray me ?
A pox of shame , nine coaches shall not stay me !
I 've two such deep healths in two joys to pledge ,
Heaven keep me from a surfeit !
Mistress Low-water !
Is she the jealous cuckold all this coil 's about ?
And my right worshipful serving-man , is it you , sir ?
A poor , wrong 'd gentleman , glad to serve for his own , sir .
By my faith , y 'have serv 'd the widow a fine trick between you .
No more my enemy now , my brother 's wife ,
And my kind sister .
There 's no starting now from't ;
' Tis her own brother , did not you know that ?
' Twas never told me yet .
I thought you 'd know n't .
What matter is't ? ' Tis the same man was chose still ,
No worse now than he was . I 'm bound to love you ;
Y'have exercis 'd in this a double charity ,
Which , to your praise , shall to all times be known ,
Advanc 'd my brother and restor 'd mine own .
Nay , somewhat for my wrongs , like a good sister ,
For well you know the tedious suit did cost
Much pains and fees ; I thank you , 'tis not lost .
You wish 'd for love , and , faith , I have bestow 'd you
Upon a gentleman that does dearly love you ;
That recompense I 've made you . And you must think , madam ,
I lov 'd you well , though I could never ease you ,
When I fetch 'd in my brother thus to please you .
Here 's unity forever strangely wrought !
I see too late there is a heavy judgment
Keeps company with extortion and foul deeds ,
And like a wind which vengeance has in chase ,
Drives back the wrongs into the injurer 's face .
My punishment is gentle , and to show
My thankful mind for't , thus I 'll revenge this
With an embracement here , and here a kiss .
Why , now the bells they go trim , they go trimly !
I wish 'd thee , sir , some unexpected blessing
For my wife 's ransom , and 'tis fall 'n upon thee .
A pox of this ! My almanac ne 'er gull 'd me till
this hour . " The thirteenth day , work for the hangman , "
and there 's nothing toward it ; I 'd been a fine ass , if I 'd given
twelve pence for a horse to have rid to Tyburn tomorrow . But
now I see the error , 'tis false figured ; it should be " thirteen
days and a half , work for the hangman , " for he ne 'er works
under thirteen pence half-penny . Beside , Venus being a spot in
the sun 's garment shows there should be a woman found in hose
and doublet .
Nay , faith , sweet wife , we 'll make no more hours on't now ; 'tis
as fine a contracting time as ever came amongst gentlefolks .
Son Philip , Master Sandfield , come to the book here !
Now I 'm waked into a thousand miseries
and their torments .
And I come after you , sir , drawn with wild
horses ; there will be a brave show on 's anon if this weather continue .
Come , wenches , where be these young gentlemen 's hands now ?
Poor gentleman , my son!--
Some other time , sir .
I 'll have 't now , i'faith , wife .
What are you making here ?
I have sworn , sweet madam ,
My son shall marry Master Sunset 's daughter ,
And Master Sandfield , mine .
So you go well , sir ;
But what make you this way then ?
This ? For my son .
Oh , back , sir , back ! This is no way for him .
SUNSET , SIR OLIVER
How ?
Oh , let me break an oath to save two souls ,
Lest I should wake another judgment greater !
You come not here for him , sir .
What 's the matter ?
Either give me free leave to make this match
Or I 'll forbid the banes .
Good madam , take it .
Here , Master Sandfield , then--
Cuds bodkins !
Take you this maid .
You could not please me better , madam .
Hoyda ! Is this your hot love to my daughter , sir ?
Come hither , Philip ; here 's a wife for you .
Zunes , he shall ne 'er do that ! Marry his sister ?
Had he been rul 'd by you , he had married her ,
But now he marries Master Sunset 's daughter ,
And Master Sandfield , yours ; I 've sav 'd your oath , sir .
Oh , may this blessing hold !
Or else all the liquor runs out .
What riddle 's this , madam ?
A riddle of some fourteen years of age now .
You can remember , madam , that your daughter
Was put to nurse to Master Sunset 's wife .
True , that we talk 'd on lately .
I grant that , madam .
Then you shall grant what follows . At that time
You likewise know old Master Sunset here
Grew backward in the world , till his last fortunes
Rais 'd him to this estate .
Still this we know too .
His wife , then nurse both to her own and yours ,
And both so young , of equal years , and daughters ,
Fearing the extremity of her fortunes then
Should fall upon her infant , to prevent it ,
She chang 'd the children , kept your daughter with her ,
And sent her own to you for better fortunes .
So long , enjoin 'd by solemn oath unto't
Upon her death bed , I have conceal 'd this ;
But now so urg 'd , here 's yours , and this is his .
Whoop , the joy is come of our side !
Hay , I 'll cast mine almanac to the moon too , and strike out a
new one for next year !
It wants expression , this miraculous blessing !
Methinks I could spring up and knock my head
Against yon silver ceiling now for joy !
By my faith , but I do not mean to follow you there , so I may dash
out my brains against Charles ' Wain and come down as wise as a
carman .
I never wonder 'd yet with greater pleasure .
What tears have I bestow 'd on a lost daughter
And left her behind me !
This is Grace ,
This Jane ; now each has her right name and place .
I never heard of this .
I 'll swear you did not , sir .
How well I have kept mine oath against my will !
Clap hands , and joy go with you . Well said , boys !
How art thou bless 'd from shame and I from ruin !
I , from the baker 's ditch , if I 'd seen you in .
Not possible the whole world to match again
Such grief , such joy , in minutes lost and won .
Whoever knew more happiness in less compass ?
Ne 'er was poor gentleman so bound to a sister
As I am for the wittiness of thy mind ;
Not only that thy due , but all our wealth
Shall lie as open as the sun to man
For thy employments , so the charity
Of this dear bosom bids me tell thee now .
I am her servant for't .
Hah , worthy sister !
The government of all I bless thee with .
Come , gentlemen , on all perpetual friendship .
Heaven still relieves what misery would destroy ;
Never was night yet of more general joy .
WEATHERWISE
Now let me see what weather shall we have now .
Hold fair now , and I care not . Mass , full moon , too ,
Just between five and six this afternoon !
This happens right : " The sky for the best
part clear ,
Save here and there a cloud or two dispers 'd . "
That 's some dozen of panders and half a score
Pickpockets ; you may know them by their whistle ,
And they do well to use that while they may ,
For Tyburn cracks the pipe and spoils the music .
What says the destiny of the hour this evening ?
Hah ! Fear no colours ! " By my troth ,
agreed then :
The red and white looks cheerfully . For know ye all ,
The planet 's Jupiter : you should be jovial ;
There 's nothing lets it but the sun i' th ' Dog :
Some bark in corners that will fawn and cog ,
Glad of my fragments for their ember week .
The sign 's in Gemini too : both hands should meet ;
There should be noise i' th ' air if all things hap ,
Though I love thunder when you make the clap .
Some faults perhaps have slipp 'd , I am to answer ;
And if in anything your revenge appears ,
Send me in with all your fists about mine ears .
