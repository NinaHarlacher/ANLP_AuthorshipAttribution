Welcome , good Captain Ironside , and Bro-
ther ;
You shall along with me .
I 'm lodg 'd hard by
Here , at a noble Ladies House i' th ' street ,
The Lady Loadstones ( one will bid us welcome )
Where there are Gentlewomen , and male Guests
Of several humours , carriage , constitution ,
Profession too : but so diametral
One to another , and so much oppos 'd ,
As if I can but hold them all together ,
And draw 'em to a sufferance of themselves ,
But till the Dissolution of the Dinner ,
I shall have just occasion to believe
My wit is magisterial ; and our selves
Take infinite delight i' the success .
Troth , Brother Compass , you shall pardon me ;
I love not so to multiply acquaintance
At a Meals cost ; 'twill take off o ' my freedom
So much ; or bind me to the least observance .
Why , Ironside , you know I am a Scholar ,
And part a Soldier ; I have been employed
By some the greatest States-men o ' the Kingdom ,
These many years : and in my time convers 'd
With sundry humors , suiting so my self
To company , as honest Men , and Knaves ,
Good-fellows , Hypocrites , all sorts of People ,
Though never so divided in themselves ,
Have studied to agree still in the usage ,
And handling of me ( which hath been fair too . )
Sir I confess you to be one well read
In Men , and Manners ; and that , usually ,
The most ungover n 'd Persons , you being present ,
Rather subject themselves unto your censure ,
Than give you least occasion of distaste ,
By making you the subject of their mirth :
But ( to deal plainly with you , as a Brother )
When ever I distrust i' my own Valour :
I 'll never bear me on anothers Wit ,
Or offer to bring off , or save my self
On the opinion of your Judgment , Gravity ,
Discretion , or what else .
But ( being away )
You 'are sure to have less-wit-work , gentle Brother ,
My humour being as stubborn as the rest ,
And as unmanageable .
You do mistake
My Caract of your friendship all this while !
Or at what rate I reckon your assistance ,
Knowing by long experience , to such Animals ,
Half-hearted Creatures , as these are , your Fox there ,
Unkennel 'd with a Cholerick , ghastly aspect ,
Or two or three comminatory Terms ,
Would run their fears to any hole of shelter ,
Worth a days laughter ! I am for the sport :
For nothing else .
But , Brother , I ha' seen
A Coward , meeting with a Man as valiant
As our St .
George ( not knowing him to be such ,
Or having least opinion that he was so )
Set to him roundly , I , and swinge him soundly :
And i' the vertue of that error , having
Once overcome , resolv 'd for ever after
To erre ; and think no Person , nor no Creature
More valiant than himself .
I think that too :
But , Brother , ( could I over intreat you )
I have some little Plot upon the rest
If you would be contented , to endure
A sliding reprehension at my hands ,
To hear your self , or your profession glanc 'd at
In a few slighting terms : It would beget
Me such a main Authority , o ' the bie ,
And do your self no dis-repute at all !
Compass , I know that universal Causes
In nature produce nothing , but as meeting
Particular Causes , to determine those ,
And specifie their acts .
This is a piece
Of Oxford Science , staies with me ere since
I left that place ; and I have often found
The truth thereof , in my private passions :
For I do never feel my self perturb 'd
With any general words 'gainst my profession ,
Unless by some smart stroke upon my self
They do awake , and stir me : else , to wise
And well experienc 'd Men , words do but signifie ;
They have no power , save with dull Grammarians ,
Whose Souls are nought , but a Syntaxis of them .
Here comes our Parson , Parson Palate here ,
A venerable Youth ! I must salute him ,
And a great Clerk ! he 's going to the Ladies ,
And though you see him thus , without his Cope ,
I dare assure you , he 's our Parish Pope !
God save my reverend Clergy , Parson Palate .
THe witty Mr. Compass ! how is't , with you ?
My Lady stays for you , and for your
Counsel ,
Touching her Niece Mrs. Placentia Steel !
Who strikes the fire of full fourteen to day ,
Ripe for a Husband .
I , she chimes , she chimes .
Saw you the Doctor Rut , the House Physician ?
He 's sent for too .
To Counsel ?
time yo'were there .
Make haste , and give it a round quick dispatch :
That we may go to Dinner betimes , Parson :
And drink a Health , or two more , to the business .
This is a strange put-off ! a reverend youth ,
You use him most surreverently methinks !
What call you him ?
Palate Please ?
or Parson Palate ?
All 's one , but shorter ! I can gi' you his Character .
He is the Prelate of the Parish , here ,
And governs all the Dames , appoints the Cheer ,
Writes down the Bills of Fare , pricks all the Guests ,
Makes all the Matches and the Marriage Feasts
Within the Ward ; draws all the Parish Wills ,
Designs the Legacies , and strokes the Gills
Of the chief Mourners : And ( whoever lacks )
Of all the Kindred , he hath first his Blacks .
Thus holds he Weddings up , and Burials ,
As his main Tithing ; with the Gossips Stalls ,
Their Pews ; he 's top still , at the Publick Mess ,
Comforts the Widow , and the fatherless ,
In funeral Sack ! Sits 'bove the Alderman?
For of the Ward-mote Quest , he better can ,
The mystery , than the Levitick Law :
That piece of Clark-ship doth his Vestry awe .
He is , as he conceives himself , a fine
Well furnish 'd , and apparelled Divine .
Who made this Epigram , you ?
No, a great Clerk
As any 's of his bulk ( Benj .
Johnson ) made it .
But what 's the other Character , Doctor Rut ?
The same Man made 'em both : but his is shorter ,
And not in Rhime , but Blanks .
I 'll tell you that , too .
Rut is a young Physician to the Family :
That , letting God alone , ascribes to nature
More than her share ; licentious in discourse ,
And in his life a profest Voluptuary ;
The slave of Money , a Buffoon in Manners ;
Obscene in Language ; which he vents for Wit ;
Is sawcy in his Logicks , and disputing ;
Is any thing but Civil , or a Man .
See here they are ! and walking with my Lady ,
In consultation , afore the Door ;
We will slip in , as if we saw 'em not .
I , 'tis his fault , she 's not bestow 'd ,
My Brother Interests .
Who , old Sir Moath ?
He keeps off all her Suitors , keeps the Portion
Still in his Hands : and will not part with all ,
On any terms .
Hinc ill? lachrym? ;
Thence flows the cause o ' the main grievance .
That
It is a main one ! how much is the Portion ?
No petty sum .
But sixteen thousand Pound .
He should be forc 'd , Madam , to lay it down .
When is it payable ?
When she is married .
Marry her , marry her , Madam .
Get her married .
Loose not a day , an hour ? ? ?
Not a minute .
Pursue your Project real , Mr. Compass
Advis 'd you to .
He is the perfect Instrument
Your Ladiship should sail by .
Now , Mr. Compass
Is a fine witty Man ; I saw him go in , now .
Is he gone in ?
Yes , and a Feather with him ,
He seems a Soldier .
Some new Suitor , Madam .
I am beholding to him : He brings ever
Variety of good Persons to my Table ,
And I must thank him , though my Brother Interest
Dislike of it a little .
He likes nothing
That runs your way .
Troth , and the other cares not .
He 'll go his own way , if he think it right .
He 's a true Friend ! and there 's Mr. Practice ,
The fine young Man of Law , comes to the House :
My Brother brooks him not , because he thinks
He is by me assigned for my Niece :
He will not hear of it .
Not of that Ear :
But yet your Ladiship doth wisely in it ? ?
' Twill make him to lay down the Portion sooner ,
If he but dream you 'll match her with a Lawyer .
So Mr. Compass says .
It is between
The Lawyer , and the Courtier , which shall have her .
Who , Sir Diaphanous Silk-worm ?
A fine Gentleman ,
Old Mr. Silk-worm 's Heir .
And a neat Courtier ,
Of a most elegant Thread .
And so my Gossip
Polish assures me .
Here she comes ! good Polish
Welcome in troth ! How do 'st thou , gentle Polish ?
Who 's this ?
Dame Polish , her She-parasite ,
Her talking , soothing , sometime governing Gossip .
YOur Ladiship is still the Lady Loadstone ,
That draws , and draws unto you , Guests of all
sorts :
The Courtiers , and the Soldiers , and the Scholars ,
The Travellers , Physicians , and Divines ,
As Doctor Ridley writ , and Doctor Barlow .
They both have wrote of you , and Mr. Compass .
We mean , they shall write more , ere it be long .
Alas , they are both dead , and't please you ; but
Your Ladiship means well , and shall mean well ,
So long as I live .
How does your fine Niece ?
My charge , Mistris Placentia Steel ?
She is not well .
Not well ?
Her Doctor says so .
Not very well ; she cannot shoot at Buts ,
Or manage a great Horse , but she can cranch
A sack of Small-coal ! eat you Lime , and Hair ,
Soap-ashes , Loam , and has a dainty spice
O' the Green-sickness ! Pol .
'Od shield ! Rut .
Or the Dropsie !
A toy , a thing of nothing .
But my Lady , here ,
Her noble Aunt .
She is a noble Aunt !
And a right worshipful Lady , and a vertuous ;
I know it well ! Rut .
Well , if you know it , peace .
Good Sister Polish , hear your betters speak .
Sir I will speak , with my good Ladies leave ,
And speak , and speak again ; I did bring up
My Ladies Niece , Mrs. Placentia Steel ,
With my own Daughter ( who 's Placentia too )
And waits upon my Lady , is her Woman :
Her Ladiship well knows Mrs. Placentia
Steel ( as I said ) her curious Niece , was left
A Legacy to me , by Father and Mother ,
With the Nurse , Keep , that tended her : her Mother
She died in Child-bed of her , and her Father
Liv 'd not long after : for he lov 'd her Mother !
They were a godly couple ! yet both di 'd ,
( As we must all . )
No Creature is immortal ,
I have heard our Pastor say : no , not the faithful !
And they did die ( as I said ) both in one month ,
Sure she is not long liv 'd , if she spend Breath thus .
R r r Pol .
And
490 The Magnetick Lady .
And did bequeath her , to my care , and hand ,
To polish , and bring up .
I moulded her ,
And fashion 'd her , and form 'd her ; she had the sweat
Both of my Brows and Brains .
My Lady knows it
Since she could write a quarter old .
I know not
That she could write so early , my good Gossip .
But I do know she was so long your care ,
Till she was twelve year old ; that I call 'd for her ,
And took her home , for which I thank you Polish ,
And am beholden to you .
I sure thought
She had a Lease of talking , for nine lives ? ?
It may be she has .
Sir , sixteen thousand Pound
Was then her Portion ! for she was , indeed ,
Their only Child ! and this was to be paid
Upon her Marriage , so she married still
With my good Ladies liking here , her Aunt :
( I heard the Will read ) Mr. Steel , her Father ,
The World condemn 'd him to be very rich ,
And very hard ; and he did stand condemn 'd
With that vain World , till , as 'twas prov 'd , after
He left almost as much more to good uses
In Sir Moath Interest 's hands , my Ladies Brother ,
Whose Sister he had married : he holds all
In his close gripe .
But Mr. Steel was liberal ,
And a fine Man ; and she a dainty Dame ,
And a religious , and a bountiful ? ? ?
Spare the torture ,
I do confess without it .
And her Husband ,
What a fine couple they were ?
and how they liv 'd ?
And lov 'd together , like a pair of Turtles ! Com .
And feasted all the Neighbours .
Com Take her off
Some body that hath mercy .
O he knows her ,
It seems ! Com .
Or any measure of compassion :
Doctors , if you be Christians , undertake
One for the Soul , the other for the Body !
She would dispute with the Doctors of Divinity ,
At her own Table ! and the Spittle Preachers !
And find out the Armenians .
The Armenians ?
I say , the Armenians .
Nay , I say so too !
So Mr. Polish call 'd 'em , the Armenians !
And Medes and Persians , did he not ?
Yes , he knew 'em ,
And so did Mistris Steell : She was his Pupil .
The Armenians , he would say , were worse than Papists :
And then the Persians were our Puritans ,
Had the fine piercing wits ! Com .
And who , the Medes ?
The middle Men , the luke-warm Protestants ?
Out , out .
Sir , she would find them by their
branching :
Their branching Sleeves , brancht Cassocks , and brancht
Doctrine ,
Beside their Texts .
Stint Karlin : I 'll not hear ,
Confute her Parson .
I respect no Parsons ,
Chaplins , or Doctors , I will speak .
Yes , so't be reason ,
Let her .
' Death , she cannot speak reason .
Nor sense , if we be Masters of our senses !
What mad Woman ha' they got here , to bate ?
Sir , I am mad , in truth , and to the purpose ;
And cannot but be mad , to hear my Ladies
Dead Sister slighted , witty Mrs. Steel !
If she had a wit , Death has gone neer to spoil it ,
Assure your self .
She was both witty , and zealous ,
And lighted all the Tinder o ' the truth ,
( As one said ) of Religion , in our Parish ;
She was too learn 'd to live long with us !
She could the Bible in the Holy Tongue :
And read it without Pricks : had all her Masoreth ;
Knew Burton , and his Bull ; and scribe Prin-Gent .
Pr?sto-be-gon : and all the Pharisees .
Dear Gossip ,
Be you gone , at this time , too , and vouchsafe
To see your charge , my Niece .
I shall obey
If your wise Ladiship think fit : I know
To yield to my Superiors .
A good Woman !
But when she is impertinent , grows earnest ,
A little troublesome , and out of season :
Her love and zeal transport her .
I am glad
That any thing could port her hence .
We now
Have hope of Dinner , after her long Grace .
I have brought your Ladiship a hungry Guest here ,
A Soldier , and my Brother Captain Ironside :
Who being by custom grown a Sanguinary ,
The solemn and adopted Son of slaughter :
Is more delighted i' the chase of an Enemy ,
An execution of three days , and nights ,
Then all the hope of numerous succession ,
Or happiness of Issue could bring to him .
He is no Suitor then ?
So't should seem .
And if he can get pardon at Heavens hand
For all his murthers , is in as good case
As a new christ 'ned Infant : ( his Imployments
Continu 'd to him , without interruption ,
And not allowing him , or time , or place
To commit any other sin , but those )
Please you to make him welcome for a meal , Madam .
The nobleness of his profession makes
His welcome perfect : though your course description
Would seem to sully it .
Never , where a beam
Of so much favour doth illustrate it ,
Right knowing Lady .
She hath cur 'd all well .
And he hath fitted well the Complement .
NO , here they come ! the prime Magnetick Guests
Our Lady Loadstone so respects : the Artick !
And th ' Antartick ! Sir Diaphonous Silk-worm !
A Courtier extraordinary ; who by diet
Of Meats and Drinks , his temperate Exercise ,
Choice Musick , frequent Baths , his horary shifts
Of Shirts and Waste-coats , means to immortalize
Mortality it self , and makes the essence
Of his whole happiness the trim of Court .
I thank you , Mr. Compass , for your short
It is much in little , Sir .
Concise , and quick : the true stile of an Orator .
But Mr. Practice here , my Ladies Lawyer ,
Or Man of Law : ( for that 's the true writing )
A Man so dedicate to his profession ,
And the preferments go along with it ;
As scarce the thund 'ring brute of an Invasion ,
Another eighty eight , threat 'ning his Country
With ruin , would no more work upon him ,
Than Syracusa 's Sack , on Archimede :
So much he loves that Night-cap ! the Bench-gown !
With the broad Guard o ' th ' back ! These shew
A Man betroth 'd unto the study of our Laws !
Which you but think the crafty impositions ,
Of subtile Clerks , feats of fine understanding ,
To abuse Clots , and Clowns with , Mr. Compass ,
Having no ground in nature to sustain it ,
Or light , from those clear causes ; to the inquiry
And search of which , your Mathematical Head
Hath so devow 'd it self .
Tut , all Men are
Philosophers , to their inches .
There 's within ,
Sir Interest , as able a Philosopher ,
In buying and selling ! has reduc 'd his thrift ,
To certain principles , and i' that method !
As he will tell you instantly , by Logorythms ,
The utmost profit of a stock imployed :
( Be the commodity what it will ) the place ,
Or
The Magnetick Lady .
491
Or time , but causing very , very little ,
Or , I may say , no paralax at all ,
In his pecuniary observations !
He has brought your Nieces Portion with him , Madam ;
At least , the Man that must receive it : Here
They come negotiating the affair ;
You may perceive the Contract in their Faces ,
And read th ' Indenture .
If you 'll sign 'em : So .
WHat is he , Mr. Compass ?
A Vi-politick !
Or a sub-aiding Instrument of State !
A kind of a laborious Secretary
To a great Man ! ( and likely to come on )
Full of attendance ! and of such a stride
In business Politick , or Oeconomick ,
As well his Lord may stoop t ' advise with him ,
And be prescribed by him in affairs
Of highest consequence , when he is dull 'd ,
Or wearied with the less .
' Tis Mr. Bias ,
Lord Whach'um 's Politick .
You know the Man ?
I ha' seen him wait at Court , there , with his Maniples
Of Papers and Petitions .
He is one
That over-rules , tho ' by his authority
Of living there ; and cares for no Man else :
Neglects the Sacred Letter of the Law ;
And holds it all to be but a dead heap
Of civil Institutions : the rest only
Of common Men , and their causes , a Farrago ,
Or a made dish in Court ; a thing of nothing .
And that 's your quarrel at him ?
a just plea .
I tell you , Sister Loadstone ?
( Hang your Ears
This way , and hear his Praises : now Moath opens . )
I ha' brought you here the very Man ! the Jewel
Of all the Court ! close Mr. Bias ! Sister ,
Apply him to your side ! or you may wear him
Here o ' your Breast ! or hang him in your Ear !
He 's a fit Pendant for a Ladies tip !
A Chrysolite , a Gem : the very Agate
Of State , and Polity : cut from the Quar
Of Machiavel , a true Cornelian ,
As Tacitus himself ! and to be made
The broach to any true State-cap in Europe !
You praise him , Brother , as you had hope to sell
No, Madam , as he had hope to sell your Niece
Unto him .
' Ware your true Jests , Mr. Compass ;
They will not relish .
I will tell you , Sister ,
I cannot cry his Carract up enough :
He is unvaluable : All the Lords
Have him in that esteem , for his Relations ,
Corrant 's , Avises , Correspondences
With this Ambassador , and that Agent ! He
Will screw you out a Secret from a Statist ? ?
So easie , as some Cobler worms a Dog .
And lock it in the Cabinet of his memory ?
' Till 't turn a politick Insect , or a Fly !
Thus long .
You may be merry , Mr. Compass ,
But though you have the reversion of an Office ,
You are not in't , Sir . Bia .
Remember that .
Why should that fright me , Mr. Bi ?
, from telling
Whose ass you are ?
Sir , he 's one , can do
His turns there : and deliver too his Letters ,
As punctually , and in as good a fashion ,
As ere a Secretary can in Court .
Why , is it any matter in what fashion
A Man deliver his Letters , so he not open 'em ?
Yes , we have certain precedents in Court ,
From which we never swerve , once in an Age :
And ( whatsoe 'er he thinks ) I know the Arts ,
And Sciences do not directlier make
A Graduate in our Universities ,
Than an habitual gravity prefers
A Man in Court .
Which by the truer stile ,
Some call a formal , flat servility .
Sir , you may call it what you please : But we
( That tread the path of publick businesses )
Know what a tacit shrug is , or a shrink ;
The wearing the Callot , the politick Hood ,
And twenty other Parerga , o ' the bie ,
You Seculars understand not : I shall trick him ,
If his Reversion come i' my Lords way .
What is that , Mr. Practice ?
you sure know ?
Mas ' Compasses Reversion ?
A fine place
( Surveyor of the Projects general )
I would I had it .
What is't worth ?
O Sir ,
A Nemo scit .
We 'll think on't afore Dinner .
C H O R U S.
Now , Gentlemen , what censure you of our Protasis ,
But , there is nothing done in it , or concluded :
I thought the Law of
Comedy had reserv 'd to the Catastrophe : and that the Epi-
tasis , ( as we are taught ) and the Catastasis , had been inter-
vening parts , to have been expected .
But you would
have all come together it seems : The Clock should strike
Yes , if the nature of a Clock were to speak , not
So , if a Child could be born in a Play , and grow
get him a reputation , and marry an Emperours Daugh -
ter : for his Mrs. Convert her Fathers Country ; and at
last come home , lame and all-to-be-laden with Miracles .
These Miracles would please , I assure you : and
take the People ! For there be of the People , that will ex -
pect Miracles , and more than Miracles from this Pen .
Do they think this Pen can juggle ?
I would we
had Hokos pokos for 'em then ; your People , or Travitanto
Who 's that , Boy ?
Another Juggler , with a long name .
Or that
your expecters would be gone hence , now , at the first
My name is John , indeed ? ?
Because , who ex -
pect what is impossible , or beyond nature , defraud them -
Nay , there the Boy said well : They do defraud
themselves indeed .
And therefore , Mr. Damplay , unless like a solemn
Justice of wit , you will damn our Play , unheard , or
unexamin 'd ; I shall intreat your Mrs. Madam Expecta -
tion , if she be among these Ladies , to have patience , but
a pissing while : give our Springs leave to open a little ,
by degrees : A Source of ridiculous matter may break
forth anon , that shall steep their Temples , and bathe
their Brains in laughter , to the fomenting of stupidity
it self , and the awaking any velvet Lethargy in the
Why do you maintain your Poets quarrel so
with Velvet , and good Clothes , Boy ?
we have seen him in
indifferent good Clothes , ere now .
R r r 2 Boy .
And
492 The Magnetick Lady .
And may do in better , if it please the King
( his Master ) to say Amen to it , and allow it , to whom
he acknowledgeth all .
But his Clothes shall never be the
best thing about him , though ; he will have somewhat
beside , either of humane Letters , or severe Honesty ,
shall speak him a Man , though he went naked .
He is beholden to you , if you can make this
good , Boy .
Himself hath done that already , against Envy .
What 's your Name , Sir ?
or your Country ?
John Try-gust my Name : A Cornish Youth , and
the Poets Servant .
West-country breed I thought , you were so
Or rather sawcy ; to find out your Palate ,
Mr. Damplay .
' Faith we do call a Spade , a Spade in
If you dare damn our Play , i' the wrong
Place , we shall take heart to tell you so .
Good Boy .
Sweet Mistris , pray you be merry : you are sure
To have a Husband now .
I , if the store
Hurt not the choice .
Store is no sore , young Mistris ,
My Mother is wont to say .
And she 'll say wisely
As any Mouth i' the Parish .
Fix on one ,
Fix upon one , good Mistris .
At this call too ,
Here 's Mr. Practise , who is call 'd to the Bench
Of purpose .
Yes , and by my Ladies means ?
' Tis thought to be the Man .
A Lawyers Wife .
And a fine Lawyers Wife .
Is a brave Calling .
Sweet Mistris Practise ! Keep.
Gentle Mistris Practise !
Fair , open Mistris Practise ! Keep.
I , and close ,
And cunning Mrs. Practise ! Pla .
I not like that ;
The Courtiers is the neater calling .
Yes ,
My Lady Silk-worm .
And to shine in Plush .
Like a young night Crow , a Diaphanous Silk-worm .
Lady Diaphanous sounds most delicate !
Which would you chose , now Mistris ?
' Cannot tell .
The Copy does confound one .
Here 's my Mother .
How now , my dainty Charge , and diligent Nurse ?
What were you chanting on ?
( God bless you Maiden . )
We were inchanting all ; wishing a Husband
For my young Mistris here .
A man to please her .
She shall have a Man , good Nurse , and must
have a Man :
A Man and a half , if we can choose him out :
We are all in Counsel within , and sit about it :
The Doctors and the Scholars ; and my Lady ,
Who 's wiser then all us ?
Where 's Mr. Needle ?
Her Ladiship so lacks him to prick out
The Man ?
How does my sweet young Mistris ?
You look not well methinks ! how do you , dear Charge ?
You must have a Husband , and you shall have a Husband .
There 's two put out to making for you : A Third
Your Uncle promises : But you must still
Be rul 'd by your Aunt , according to the Will
Of your dead Father and Mother ( who are in Heaven . )
Your Lady-Aunt has choise i' the House for you :
We do not trust your Uncle ; he would keep you
A Batchelor still , by keeping of your Portion :
And keep you not alone without a Husband ,
But in a sickness : I , and the Green-sickness ,
The Maidens Malady ; which is a Sickness :
A kind of Disease , I can assure you ,
And like the Fish our Mariners call Remora ?
A Remora Mistris ! Pol .
How now Goody Nurse ?
Dame Keep of Katerns ?
what ?
have you an Oar
I ' the Cockboat , 'cause you are a Sailors Wife ,
And come from Shawdell ?
I say a Remora :
For it will stay a Ship that 's under sail !
And Stays are long and tedious things to Maids !
And Maidens are young Ships that would be sailing
When they be rigg 'd : wherefore is all their trim else ?
True ; and for them to be staid , ?
The stay is dangerous :
You know it Mr. Needle .
I know somewhat :
And can assure you , from the Doctors Mouth ,
She has a Dropsie ; and must change the Air ,
Before she can recover .
Say you so , Sir ?
The Doctor says so .
Says his Worship so ?
I warrent 'em he says true then ; they sometimes
Are Sooth-sayers , and always cunning Men .
Which Doctor was it ?
E'en my Ladies Doctor :
The neat House-Doctor : But a true Stone-Doctor .
Why ?
hear you , Nurse ?
How comes this jeer
to pass ?
This is your fault in truth : It shall be your fault ,
And must be your fault : why is your Mistris sick ?
She had her health , the while she was with me .
Alas good Mistris Polish , I am no Saint ,
Much less , my Lady , to be urg 'd give Health ,
Or Sickness at my Will : but to wait
The Stars good Pleasure , and to do my duty .
You must do more than your duty , foolish Nurse :
You must do all you can ; and more than you can ,
More than is possible ; when Folks are sick ,
Especially a Mistris , a young Mistris .
Here 's Mr. Doctor himself cannot do that .
Doctor Do-all can do it .
Thence he 's call 'd so .
WHence ?
what 's he call 'd ?
Doctor , do all you can ,
I pray you , and beseech you , for my charge here .
She 's my tendring Gossip , loves my Neice .
I know you can do all things , what you please , Sir ,
For a young Damsel , my good Ladies Neice here !
You can do what you list .
Peace Tiffany .
Especially in this new Case o ' the Dropsie .
The Gentlewoman ( I do fear ) is leven 'd .
Leven 'd ?
what 's that ?
Puft , blown , and't please your Worship .
What ! Dark by darker ?
What is blown ?
puff 'd ?
speak English ?
Tainted ( and't please you ) some do call it .
She swells , and swells so with it .
?
Give her vent ,
If she do swell .
A Gimblet must be had :
It is a Tympanites she is troubled with ;
There are three kinds : The first is Ana-sarca
Under the Flesh a Tumour : that 's not hers .
The second is Ascites , or Aquosus ,
A watry humour : that 's not hers neither .
But Tympanites ( which we call the Drum )
A wind Bombs in her Belly , must be unbrac 'd ,
And with a Faucet , or a Peg , let out ,
And she 'll do well : get her a Husband .
Yes ,
I say so , Mr. Doctor , and betimes too .
As
Soon as we can : let her bear up to day ,
Laugh , and keep company , at Gleek or Crimp .
Your Ladiship says right , Crimp sure will cure her .
Yes , and Gleek too ; peace Gossip Tittle-Tattle ,
She must to morrow down into the Country ,
Some Twenty miles ; A Coach and six brave Horses :
Take
The Magnetick Lady .
493
Take the fresh Air a Month there , or five Weeks ;
And then return a Bride up to the Town ,
For any Husband i' the Hemisphere
To chuck at ; when she has dropt her Timpany .
Must she then drop it ?
Thence , 'tis call 'd a Dropsie .
The Timpanites is one spice of it ;
A Toy , a thing of nothing , a meer Vapour :
I 'll blow't away .
Needle , get you the Coach
Ready against to morrow Morning .
Yes Madam .
I 'll down with her my self , and thank the Doctor .
We all shall thank him .
But , dear Madam , think ,
Resolve upon a Man this day .
I ha' do n't .
To tell you true , ( sweet Gossip ) here is none
But Master Doctor , he shall be o ' the Counsel :
The Man I have design 'd her to , indeed ,
Is Master Practise : he 's a neat young Man ,
Forward , and growing up in a profession !
Like to be some body , if the Hall stand !
And Pleading hold ! A prime young Lawyers Wife ,
Is a right happy Fortune .
And she bringing
So plentiful a Portion , they may live
Like King and Queen at Common Law together !
Sway Judges ; guide the Courts ; command the Clerks ;
And fright the Evidence ; rule at their Pleasures ,
Like petty Soveraigns in all Cases .
O , that
Will be a work of time ; she may be old
Before her Husband rise to a chief Judge ;
And all her flower be gone .
No, no , a Lady
O' the first Head I 'd have her ; and in Court :
The Lady Silk-worm , a Diaphanous Lady :
And be a Vi-countess to carry all
Before her , ( as we say ) her Gentleman-Usher :
And cast off Pages , bare , to bid her Aunt
Welcom unto her Honour at her Lodgings .
You say well , Ladies Gossip ; if my Lady
Could admit that , to have her Neice precede her .
For that , I must consult mine own Ambition ,
My zealous Gossip .
O , you shall precede her :
You shall be a Countess ! Sir Diaphanous
Shall get you made a Countess ! Here he comes ;
Has my Voice certain : O fine Courtier !
O blessed man ! the bravery prickt out ,
To make my dainty charge a Vi-countess :
And my good Lady , her Aunt , Countess at large !
ITell thee , Parson , if I get her , reckon
Thou hast a Friend in Court ; and shalt command
A Thousand pound , to go on any Errand ,
For any Church preferment thou hast a mind to .
I Thank your Worship : I will so work for you ,
As you shall study all the ways to thank me :
I 'll work my Lady , and my Ladies Friends ;
Her Gossip , and this Doctor , and Squire Needle ,
And Mr. Compass , who is all in all ;
The very Fly she moves by : He is one
That went to Sea with her Husband , Sir John Loadstone ,
And brought home the rich Prizes : all that Wealth
Is left her : for which Service she respects him :
A dainty Scholar in the Mathematicks ;
And one she wholly imploys .
Now Dominus Practise
Is yet the man ( appointed by her Ladiship )
But there 's a trick to set his Cap awry ,
If I know any thing : he hath confest
To me in private , that he loves another ,
My Ladies Woman , Mrs. Pleasance : therefore
Secure you of Rivalship .
I thank thee ,
My noble Parson : There 's Five hundred pound
Waits on thee more for that .
Accost the Neice :
Yonder she walks alone : I 'll move the Aunt :
But here 's the Gossip ; she expects a morsel .
Ha' you ne 'er a Ring , or Toy to throw away ?
Yes , here 's a Diamond of some Threescore Pound
I pray you give her that .
If she will take it .
And there 's an Emerald for the Doctor too :
Thou Parson , thou shalt coin me : I am thine .
Here Mr. Compass comes : Do you see my Lady ,
And all the rest , how they do flutter about him ?
He is the Oracle of the House and Family .
Now is your time : go nick it with the Neice :
I will walk by ; and hearken how the Chimes go .
NAy , Parson , stand not off ; you may approach :
This is no such hid Point of State , we handle ,
But you may hear it : for we are all of Counsel .
The gentle Mr. Practise hath dealt clearly ,
And nobly with you , Madam .
Ha' you talk 'd with him ?
And made the Overture ?
Yes , first I mov 'd
The Business trusted to me by your Ladiship ,
I ' your own words , almost your very Syllables :
Save where my Memory trespass 'd 'gainst their Elegance :
For which I hope your Pardon .
Then I inlarg 'd
In my own homely Stile , the special goodness
And greatness of your Bounty in your Choice ,
And free conferring of a Benefit ,
So without ends , conditions , any tye ,
But his meer Vertue , and the value of it ,
To call him to your Kindred , to your Veins ,
Insert him in your Family , and to make him
A Nephew by the offer of a Neice ,
With such a Portion ; which when he had heard ,
And most maturely acknowledg 'd ( as his Calling
Tends all unto maturity ) he return 'd
A Thanks as ample as the Curtesie ,
( In my Opinion ) ; said it was a Grace ,
Too great to be rejected or accepted
By him ! But as the Terms stood with his Fortune ,
He was not to prevaricate with your Ladiship ,
But rather to require ingenious leave ,
He might with the same love that it was offer 'd
Refuse it , since he could not with his honesty ,
( Being he was ingag 'd before ) receive it .
The same he said to me .
And name the Party ?
He did , and he did not .
Come , leave your Schemes ,
And fine Amphibolies , Parson .
You 'll hear more .
Why , now your Ladiship is free to chuse
The Courtier Sir Diaphanous : he shall do it ,
I 'll move it to him my self .
What will you move to him ?
The making you a Countess .
Stint , fond Woman .
Know you the Party Mr. Practise means ?
No, but your Parson says he knows , Madam .
I fear he Fables ; Parson , do you know
Where Mr. Practise is ingag 'd ?
I 'll tell you !
But under seal , her Mother must not know :
' Tis with your Ladiships Woman , Mrs. Pleasance .
How ! Lad .
He is not mad .
O hide the hideous Secret
From her , she 'll trouble all else .
You do hold
A Cricket by the Wing .
Did he name Pleasance ?
Are you sure , Parson ?
O 'tis true , your Mistris !
I find where your Shooe wrings you , Mr. Compass :
But , you 'll look to him there .
Yes , here 's Sir Moath ,
Your Brother , with his Bias , and the Party
Deep in discourse ; 'twill be a Bargain and Sale ,
I see by their close working of their Heads ,
And
494 The Magnetick Lady .
And running them together so in Counsel .
Will Mr. Practise be of Counsel against us ?
He is a Lawyer , and must speak for his Fee ,
Against his Father and Mother , all his Kindred ;
His Brothers or his Sisters : no exception
Lies at the Common-Law .
He must not alter
Nature for Form , but go on in his Path ?
It may be he will be for us .
Do not you
Offer to meddle , let them take their Course :
Dispatch , and marry her off to any Husband ;
Be not you scrupulous ; let who can have her :
So he lay down the Portion , though he geld it :
It will maintain the suit against him : somewhat ,
Something in hand is better than no Birds ;
He shall at last accompt for the utmost Farthing ,
If you can keep your hand from a Discharge .
Sir , do but make her Worshipful Aunt a Countess ,
And she is yours : her Aunt has Worlds to leave you !
The Wealth of six East-Indian Fleets at least !
Her Husband , Sir John Loadstone , was the Governour
O' the Company seven years .
And came there home
Six Fleets in seven years ?
I cannot tell ,
I must attend my Gossip her good Ladiship .
And will you make me a Vi-countess too ?
For ,
How do they make a Countess ?
in a Chair ?
Or 'pon a Bed ?
Both ways , sweet Bird , I 'll shew you .
THe truth is , Mr. Practise , now we are sure
That you are off , we dare come on the bolder :
The Portion left was Sixteen thousand pound ,
I do confess it , as a just man should .
And call here Mr. Compass , with these Gentlemen ,
To the relation : I will still be just .
Now for the Profits every way arising ,
It was the Donors Wisdom , those should pay
Me for my Watch , and breaking of my Sleeps ;
It is no petty charge , you know that sum ;
To keep a man awake for Fourteen year .
But ( as you knew to use it i' that time )
It would reward your waking .
That 's my Industry ,
As it might be your Reading , Study and Counsel ;
And now your Pleading , who denies it you ?
I have my Calling too .
Well , Sir , the Contract
Is with this Gentleman , Ten thousand pound .
( An ample Portion for a younger Brother ,
With a soft , tender , delicate Rib of Mans Flesh ,
That he may work like Wax , and print upon . )
He expects no more , than that sum to be tendred ,
And he receive it : Those are the Conditions .
A direct Bargain , and in open sale Market .
And what I have furnish 'd him withal o ' the by ,
To appear , or so : A matter of Four hundred ,
To be deduc 'd upo ' the payment .
?
You deal like a just Man still .
Draw up this ,
Good Mr. Practise , for us , and be speedy .
But here 's a mighty gain , Sir , you have made
Of this one Stock ! the Principal first doubled ,
In the first Seven year ; and that redoubled
I ' the next Seven ! beside Six thousand pound ,
There 's threescore thousand got in Fourteen year ,
After the usual Rate of Ten i' the Hundred ,
And the Ten thousand paid .
I think it be !
How will you scape the Clamour and the Envy ?
Let 'em exclaim and envy ; what care I ?
Their Murmurs raise no Blisters i' my Flesh .
My Monies are my Blood , my Parents Kindred :
And he that loves not those , he is unnatural :
I am perswaded that the love of Money
Is not a Vertue , only in a Subject ,
But might befit a Prince .
And ( were there need )
I find me able to make good the Assertion ,
To any reasonable mans Understanding ;
And make him to confess it .
Gentlemen ,
Doctors , and Scholars , you 'll hear this , and look for
As much true secular Wit , and deep Lay-sense ,
As can be shown on such a common Place .
First , we all know the Soul of man is infinite
In what it covers .
Who desireth knowledge ,
Desires it infinitely .
Who covets Honour ,
Covets it infinitely : It will be then
No hard thing for a coveting man to prove ,
Or to confess , he aims at infinite Wealth .
His Soul lying that way .
Next , every man
Is i' the hope or possibility
Of a whole World : this present World being nothing ,
But the dispersed Issue of first one :
And therefore I cannot see , but a just man
May with just reason , and in office ought
Propound unto himself .
An infinite Wealth !
I 'll bear the Burden : Go you on , Sir Moath .
Thirdly , if we consider man a Member
But of the Body Politick , we know ,
By just Experience , that the Prince hath need
More of one Wealthy , than ten fighting Men .
There you went out o ' the Road , a little from us .
And therefore , if the Princes aims be infinite ,
It must be in that , which makes all .
Infinite Wealth .
Fourthly , 'tis natural to all good Subjects ,
To set a price on Money , more than Fools
Ought on their Mrs. Picture ; every Piece
Fro ' the Penny to the Twelve pence , being the Hierogliphick ,
And sacred Sculpture of the Soveraign .
A manifest Conclusion , and a safe one .
Fifthly , Wealth gives a Man the leading Voice ,
At all Conventions ; and displaceth worth ,
with general allowance to all Parties :
It makes a Trade to take the Wall of Vertue ;
And the mere Issue of a Shop Right Honourable .
Sixthly , it doth inable him that hath it ,
It gives him precise knowledge of himself ;
For , be he rich , he straight with evidence knows
Whether he have any compassion ,
Or inclination unto Vertue , or no ;
Where the poor Knave erroneously believes ,
If he were rich , he would build Churches , or
Do such mad things .
Seventhly , your wise poor Men
Have ever been contented to observe
Rich Fools , and so to serve their turns upon them :
Subjecting all their Wit to the others Wealth .
And become Gentlemen Parasites , Squire Bawds ,
To feed their Patrons honourable Humours .
Eightly , 'tis certain that a Man may leave
His Wealth , or to his Children , or his Friends ;
His Wit he cannot so dispose by Legacy ?
As they shall be a Harrington the better for't .
He may intail a Jest upon his House :
Or leave a Tale to his Posterity ,
To be told after him .
As you have done here ?
T'invite your Friend and Brother to a Feast ,
Where all the Guests are so mere Heterogene ,
And Strangers , no Man knows another , or cares
If they be Christians or Mahumetans !
That here are met .
Is't any thing to you , Brother ,
To know Religions more than those you fight for ?
Yes , and with whom I eat .
I may dispute ,
And how shall I hold Argument with such ,
I neither know their Humours nor their Heresies ;
Which are Religions now , and so receiv 'd ?
Here 's no Man among these that keeps a Servant ,
T'inquire
The Magnetick Lady .
495
To ' inquire his Master of : yet i' the House ,
I hear it buz 'd there are a brace of Doctors ,
A Fool , and a Physician ; with a Courtier ,
That feeds on Mulberry-leaves , like a true Silk-worm :
A Lawyer , and a mighty Money-Bawd ,
Sir Moath ! has brought his politick Bias with him :
A man of a most animadverting humour ;
Who , to endear himself unto his Lord ,
Will tell him , you and I , or any of us ,
That here are met , are all perncious Spirits ,
And men of pestilent purpose , meanly affected
Unto the State we live in : and beget
Himself a thanks with the great men o ' the time ,
By breeding Jealousies in them of us ,
Shall cross our Fortunes , frustrate our Endeavours ,
Twice seven years after : And this trick be call 'd
Cutting of Throats , with a whispering , or a Pen-knife .
I must cut his Throat now : I'am bound in Honour ,
And by the Law of Arms , to see it done ;
I dare to do it ; and I dare profess
The doing of it : being to such a Rascal ,
Who is the common offence grown of mankind ,
And worthy to be torn up from society .
You shall not do it here , Sir .
Why ?
will you
Intreat your self into a beating for him ,
My courteous Brother ?
If you will , have at you ,
No man deserves it better ( now I think on't )
Than you : that will keep consort with such Fidlers ,
Pragmatick Flies , Fools , Publicans , and Moaths :
And leave your honest and adopted Brother .
' Best raise the House upon him , to secure us ;
He 'll kill us all ! Pal .
I love no Blades in Belts .
Nor I.
Would I were at my Shop again ,
In Court , safe stow 'd up , with my politick Bundels .
How they are scatter 'd ! Iro .
Run away like Cimici ,
Into the cranies of a rotten Bed-stead .
I told you such a passage would disperse 'em ,
Although the House were their Fee-simple in Law ,
And they possest of all the blessings in it .
Pray Heaven they be not frighted from their Stomachs :
That so my Ladies Table be disfurnish 'd
Of the Provisions ! Com .
No, the Parson 's calling
By this time , all the Covey again , together .
Here comes good tydings ! Dinner 's o ' the Board .
STay , Mrs. Pleasance , I must ask you a question :
Ha' you any Sutes in Law ?
I , Mr. Compass ?
Answer me briefly , it is dinner time .
They say you have retain 'd brisk Mr. Practice
Here , of your Counsel ; and are to be join 'd
A Patentee with him .
In what ?
who says so ?
You are dispos 'd to jest .
No, I am in earnest .
It is given out i' the House so , I assure you ;
But keep your right to your self , and not acquaint
A common Lawyer with your Case .
If he
Once find the gap ; a thousand will leap after .
I 'll tell you more anon .
This Riddle shews
A little like a Love-trick , o ' one face ,
If I could understand it .
I will study it .
C H O R U S.
BUt whom doth your Poet mean now by this ?
Mr. Bias ?
what Lord 's Secretary doth he pur-
pose to personate , or perstringe ?
You might as well ask me , what Alderman , or
Alderman 's Mate , he meant by Sir Moath Interest ?
or
what eminent Lawyer , by the ridiculous Mr. Practice ?
who hath rather his name invented for laughter , than
any offence or injury it can stick on the reverend Pro-
fessors of the Law : And so the wise ones will think .
It is an insiduous question , Brother Damplay !
Iniquity it self would not have urg 'd it .
It is picking
Would
you ask of Plautus , and Terence , ( if they both liv 'd now )
Yes , he would : and inquire of Martial , or any
other Epigrammatist , whom he meant by Titius , or Sejus ,
( the common John a Noke , or John a Stile ) under whom
they note all Vices and Errors , taxable to the Times ?
As
if there could not be a name for a Folly fitted to the
Stage , but there must be a Person in nature found out to
own it .
Why , I can phant 'sie a Person to my self , Boy ,
who shall hinder me ?
And in not publishing him , you do no man an
But if you will utter your own ill meaning on
that Person , under the Author 's words , you make a Li-
bel of his Comedy .
O , he told us that in a Prologue , long since .
If you do the same reprehensible ill things , still
the same reprehension will serve you , though you heard
it afore : They are his own words : I can invent no bet-
ter , nor he .
It is the solemn vice of interpretation , that de-
the Glass of custom ( which is Comedy ) is so held up to
me by the Poet , as I can therein view the daily examples
of Mens lives , and mages of truth , in their Manners , so
drawn for my delight , or profit , as I may (either way )
use them : and will I , rather ( than make that true use )
hunt out the Persons to defame , by my malice of misap -
plying ?
and imperil the innocence and candor of the Au-
thor , by his calumny ?
It is an unjust way of hearing and
beholding Plays , this , and most unbecoming a Gentleman
to appear malignantly witty in anothers Work .
They are no other but narrow , and shrunk na -
tures , shrivel 'd up , poor things , that cannot think well of
themselves , who dare to detract others .
That Signature
is upon them , and it will last .
A half-witted Barbarism !
which no Barbers Art , or his Balls , will ever expunge or
take out .
Why , Boy ?
This were a strange Empire , or ra -
ther a Tyranny , you would entitle your Poet to , over
Gentlemen , that they should come to hear , and see
Plays , and say nothing for their Money .
O , yes , say what you will ; so it be to purpose
and in place .
Can any thing be out of purpose at a Play ?
I ,
see no reason , if I come here , and give my eighteen
Pence , or two Shillings for my Seat , but I should take it
out in censure , on the Stage .
Your two Shilling worth is allow 'd you : but you
will take your ten Shilling worth , your twenty Shilling
worth , and more : And teach others ( about you ) to do
the like , that follow your leading Face ; as if you were
Who should teach us the right , or wrong at a Play ?
If your own Science cannot do it , or the love of
Modesty , and Truth ; all other intreaties , or attempts ?
are vain .
You are fitter Spectators for the Bears , than
us , or the Puppets .
This is a popular ignorance indeed ,
somewhat better apparel 'd in you , than the People : but
a hard-handed , and stiff ignorance , worthy a Trewel , or
a Hammer-man ; and not only fit to be scorn 'd , but to
be triumph 'd ore .
By whom , Boy ?
No
496 The Magnetick Lady .
No particular , but the general neglect , and si-
Good Master Damplay , be your self still , without
a second : few here are of your opinion to day , I hope ;
to morrow , I am sure there will be none , when they
have ruminated this .
Let us mind what you come for , the Play , which
will draw on to the Epitasis now .
WHere 's Mr. Doctor ?
O , Mr. Tim Item ,
His learned ' Pothecary ! you are welcome :
He is within at Dinner .
Dinner ! Death !
That he will eat now , having such a business ,
That so concerns him ! Nee .
Why , can any business
Concern a man like his Meat ?
O twenty Millions ,
To a Physician that 's in practice : I
Do bring him news , from all the Points o ' the Compass ,
( That 's all the parts of the sublunary Globe )
Of times , and double times .
In , in , sweet Item ,
And furnish forth the Table with your news :
Deserve your Dinner : Sow out your whole Bag full :
The Guests will hear it .
I heard they were out .
But they are piec'd , and put together again ;
You may go in , you 'll find them at high eating :
The Parson has an edifying Stomach ,
And a persuading Palate ( like his name : )
He hath begun three draughts of Sack in Doctrines ,
And four in Uses .
And they follow him .
No, Sir Diaphanous is a Recusant
In Sack .
He only takes it in French Wine ,
With an allay of Water .
In , in , Item ,
And leave your peeping .
I have a months mind ,
To peep a little too .
Sweet , Mas ' Needle ,
How are they set ?
At the Boards-end , my Lady ?
And my young Mrs. by her ?
Yes , the Parson
On the right-hand ( as he 'll not lose his place
For thrusting ) and 'gainst him Mrs. Polish :
Next , Sir Diaphanous , against Sir Moath ;
Knights , one again another : then the Soldier ,
The man of War ; and man of Peace , the Lawyer :
Then the pert Doctor , and the politick Bias ,
And Mr. Compass circumscribeth all .
Nurse Keep , nurse Keep !
What noise is that within ?
Come to my Mistriss , all their Weapons are out .
Mischief of men ! what day , what hour is this ?
Run for the Cellar of Strong-waters , quickly .
WEre you a Mad-man to do this at Table ?
And trouble all the Guests , to affright the
Ladies ,
And Gentlewomen ?
Pox upo ' your Women ,
And your half-man there , Court-Sir Amber-gris :
A perfum 'd Braggart : He must drink his Wine
With three parts Water ; and have Amber in that too .
And you must therefore break his Face with a
Glass ,
And wash his Nose in Wine .
Cannot he drink
In Orthodox , but he must have his Gums ,
And Panym Drugs ?
You should have us 'd the Glass
Rather as Balance , than the Sword of Justice :
But you have cut his Face with it , he bleeds .
Come you shall take your Sanctuary with me ;
The whole house will be up in Arms 'gainst you else ,
Within this half hour : this way to my Lodging .
Rut , Lady , Polish , Keep carrying Placentia over the Stage .
Pleasance , Item .
A most rude action ! carry her to her Bed ;
And use the Fricace to her , with those Oils .
Keep your news , Item , now , and tend this business .
Good Gossip look to her .
How do you , sweet charge ?
She 's in a sweat .
I , and a faint sweat marry .
Let her alone to Tim : he has directions ,
I 'll hear your news Tim Item , when you ha' done .
Was ever such a Guest brought to my Table ?
These boistrous Soldiers ha' no better breeding .
Here Mr. Compass comes : where 's your Captain ,
Rudhudibras de Ironside ?
Gone out of Doors .
Would he had ne 'er come in them , I may wish .
He has discredited my House , and Board ,
With his rude swaggering manners , and endanger 'd
My Nieces Health ( by drawing of his Weapon )
God knows how far ; for Mr. Doctor does not .
The Doctor is an Ass then , if he say so ,
And cannot with his conjuring names , Hippocrates ,
Galen , or Rasis , Avicen , Averroes ,
Cure a poor Wenches falling in a swoon :
Which a poor Farthing chang 'd in Rosa solis ,
Or Cynnamon-water would .
How now ?
how does she ?
She 's somewhat better .
Mr. Item has brought her
A little about .
But there 's Sir Moath , your Brother ,
Is fall 'n into a fit o ' the Happyplex ,
It were a happy place for him , and us ,
If he could steal to Heaven thus : All the House
Are calling Mr. Doctor , Mr. Doctor .
The Parson he has gi'n him gone , this half hour ;
He 's pale in the Mouth already , for the fear
O' the fierce Captain .
Help me to my Chamber ,
Nurse Keep : would I could see the day no more ,
But night hung over me , like some dark Cloud ;
That , buried with this loss of my good name ,
I , and my House might perish , thus forgotten ?
Her taking it to heart thus , more afflicts me
Than all these accidents , for they 'll blow over .
IT was a barbarous injury , I confess :
But if you will be counsell 'd , Sir , by me ,
The reverend Law lies open to repair
Your Reputation .
That will gi' you damages ;
Five thousand Pound for a Finger , I have known
Given in Court : and let me pack your Jury .
There 's nothing vexes me , but that he has stain 'd
My new white Sattin Doublet ; and bespatter 'd
My spick and span Silk-stockings , o ' the day
They were drawn on : and here 's a spot i' my Hose too .
Shrewd maims ! your Clothes are wounded de-
sperately ,
And that ( I think ) troubles a Courtier more ,
An exact Courtier , than a gash in his Flesh .
My Flesh ?
I swear had he giv'n me twice so
much ,
I never should ha' reckon 'd it .
But my Clothes
To be defac 'd , and stigmatiz 'd so foully !
I take it as a contumely done me
Above the wisdom of our Laws to right .
Why , then you 'll challenge him ?
I will advise ,
Though Mr. Practice here doth urge the Law ;
And reputation it will make me of credit ,
Beside great damages .
( Let him pack my Jury . )
He
The Magnetick Lady .
497
He speaks like Mr. Practice , one that is
The Child of a Profession he 's vow 'd to ,
And servant to the study he hath taken ,
A pure Apprentice at Law ! But you must have
The Counsel o ' the Sword ; and square your action
Unto their Canons , and that Brother-hood ,
If you do right .
I tell you , Mr. Compass ,
You speak not like a Friend unto the Laws ,
Nor scarce a subject , to perswade him thus ,
Unto the breach o ' the Peace : Sir you forget
There is a Court above , of the Star-Chamber ,
To punish Routs and Riots .
No, young Master ,
Although your name be Practice there in Term-time ,
I do remember it .
But you 'll not hear
What I was bound to say ; but like a wild
Young haggard Justice , fly at breach o ' the Peace ,
Before you know whether the amorous Knight
Dares break the Peace of Conscience in a Duel .
Troth , Mr. Compass , I take you my Friend ;
You shall appoint of me in any matter
That 's reasonable , so we may meet fair ,
On even terms .
I shall perswade no other ,
( And take your learned Counsel to advise you )
I 'll run along with him .
You say you 'll meet him
On even terms .
I do not see indeed
How that can be , 'twixt Ironside and you ,
Now I consider it .
He is my Brother .
I do confess ( we ha' call 'd so twenty year : )
But you are , Sir , a Knight in Court , allied there ,
And so befriended , you may easily answer
The worst success : He a known , noted , bold
Boy o ' the Sword , hath all Mens Eyes upon him ;
And there 's no London-Jury , but are led
In Evidence , as far by common Fame ,
As they are by present Deposition .
Then you have many Brethren , and near Kinsmen .
If he kill you , it will be a lasting quarrel
' Twixt them , and him .
Whereas Rud .
Ironside ,
Although he ha' got his Head into a Beaver ,
With a huge Feather , 's but a Corriers Son ,
And has not two old Cordov'an Skins to leave
In Leather Caps to mourn him in , if he die .
Again , you are generally belov 'd , he hated
So much , that all the Hearts , and Votes of Men
Go with you , in the wishing all prosperity
Unto your purpose : he 's a fat , corpulent ,
Unwieldy Fellow : you , a dieted Spark ,
Fit for the Combat .
He has kill 'd so many ,
As it is ten to one his turn is next ;
You never fought with any ; less , slew any :
And therefore have the hopes before you .
I hope these things thus specified unto you ,
Are fair advantages : you cannot encounter
Him upon equal terms .
Beside , Sir Silk-worm ,
He hath done you wrong in a most high degree :
And sense of such an injury receiv 'd ,
Should so exacuate , and wet your Choler ,
As you should count your self an Host of Men ,
Compar 'd to him .
And therefore you , Brave Sir ,
Have no more reason to provoke , or challenge
Him , than the huge great Porter has to try
His strength upon an Infant .
Mr. Compass ,
You rather spur me on , than any way
Abate my Courage to the Enterprise .
All Counsel 's as it 's taken .
If you stand
On point of Honour , not t ' have any odds ,
I have rather then dissuaded you , than otherwise :
If upon terms of humour and revenge ,
I have encourag 'd you .
So that I think ,
I have done the part of a Friend on either side :
In furnishing your fear with matter first ,
If you have any : Or , if you dare fight ,
To heighten , and confirm your resolution .
I now do crave your pardon , Mr. Compass :
I did not apprehend your way before ,
The true Perimiter of it : you have Circles ,
And such fine Draughts about ! Silk .
Sir , I do thank you ,
I thank you , Mr. Compass , heartily ;
I must confess , I never fought before ,
And I 'll be glad to do things orderly ,
In the right place : I pray you instruct me .
Is't best I fight ambitiously , or maliciously ?
Sir , if you never fought before , be wary ,
Trust not your self too much .
Why ?
I assure you ,
I 'm very angry .
Do not suffer , though ,
The flatuous , windy Choler of your Heart ,
To move the Clapper of your Understanding ,
Which is the guiding faculty , your Reason :
You know not , if you 'll fight , or no , being brought
Upo ' the place .
O yes , I have imagin 'd
Him treble arm 'd , provok 'd too , and as furious
As Homer makes Achilles ; and I find
My self not frighted with his Fame one jot .
Well , yet take heed .
These fights imaginary ,
Are less than skirmishes ; the fight of Shadows :
For Shadows have their figure , motion ,
And their umbratil action from the real
Posture , and motion of the Bodies act :
Whereas ( imaginarily ) many times ,
Those Men may fight , dare scarce eye one another ,
And much less meet .
But if there be no help ,
Faith I would wish you , send him a fair Challenge .
I will go pen it presently .
But word it
In the most generous terms .
Let me alone .
And silken Phrase : the courtliest kind of quarrel .
He 'll make it a Petition for his Peace .
O , yes , of right , and he may do it by Law .
COme , bring him out into the Air a little :
There set him down .
Bow him , yet bow him more ,
Dash that same Glass of Water in his Face :
Now tweak him by the Nose .
Hard , harder yet :
If it but call the Blood up from the Heart ,
I ask no more .
See , what a fear can do !
Pinch him in the Nape of the Neck now ; nip him , nip him .
He feels , there 's life in him .
He groans , and stirs .
Tell him the Captain 's gone .
Ha ! Pal .
He 's gone , Sir .
Gi' him a box , hard , hard , on his left Ear .
O ! Rut .
How do you feel your self ?
Sore , sore .
But where ?
I ' my Neck .
I nipt him there .
And i' my Head .
I box 'd him twice , or thrice , to move those Sinews .
I swear you did .
What a brave Man 's a Doctor ,
To beat one into Health ! I thought his blows
Would e 'en ha' kill 'd him : he did feel no more
Than a great Horse .
Is the wild Captain gone ?
That Man of murther ?
All is calm and quiet .
Say you so , Cousen Bias ?
Then all 's well .
How quickly a Man is lost ! Bia .
And soon recover 'd !
Where there are means , and Doctors , learned Men ,
And their Apothecaries , who are not now ,
( As Chawcer says ) their friendship to begin .
Well , could they teach each other how to win
I'their swath Bands ?
Leave your Poetry , good Gossip .
Your Chawcer 's Clouts , and wash your Dishes with 'em ,
We must rub up the Roots of his Disease ,
And crave your peace awhile , or else your absence .
Nay , I know when to hold my peace .
Then do it .
Gi' me your Hand , Sir Moath .
Let 's feel your Pulse .
It is a pursiness , a kind of stoppage ,
S s s Or
498 The Magnetick Lady .
Or tumour o ' the Purse , for want of exercise ,
That you are troubled with : some ligatures
I'th neck of your Vesica , or Marsupium ,
Are so close knit , that you cannot evaporate :
And therefore you must use relaxatives .
Beside , they say , you are so restive grown ,
You cannot but with trouble put your Hand
Into your Pocket , to discharge a Reckoning .
And this we Sons of Physick do call Chiragra ,
A kind of Cramp , or Hand-Gout .
You shall purge for't .
Indeed your Worship should do well t ' advise him
To cleanse his Body , all the three high-ways ;
That is , by Sweat , Purge , and Phlebotomy .
You say well , learned Tim , I 'll first prescribe him ,
To give his Purse a purge once , twice a week
At Dice , or Cards : And when the weather is open ,
Sweat at a Bowling-Alley : or be let Blood
I ' the lending Vein , and bleed a matter of fifty ,
Or threescore Ounces at a time .
Then put
Your Thumbs under your Girdle , and have some body
Else pull out your Purse for you , till with more ease ,
And a good habit , you can do it your self .
And then be sure always to keep good Diet ;
And h ' your Table furnish 'd from one end
Unto tother : It is good for the Eyes ;
But feed you on one dish still , ha' your Diet-drink
Ever in Bottles ready , which must come
From the King 's-head : I will prescribe you nothing ,
But what I 'll take before you mine own self :
That is my course with all my Patients .
Very methodical , Secund?m Artem .
And very safe pro captu recipientis .
All errant learned Men , how they 'spute Latin !
I had it of a Jew , and a great Rabbi ,
Who every morning cast his Cup of White-wine
With Sugar , and by the residence i' the bottom ,
Would make report of any Chronick malady ,
Such as Sir Moath 's is , being an oppilation ,
In that you call the Neck o ' the Money-bladder ,
Most anatomical , and by dissection .
O , Mr. Doctor , and his ' Pothecary !
Good Mr. Item , and my Mistriss Polish !
We need you all above ! She 's fall 'n again ,
In a worse fit than ever .
Who ?
Your charge .
Come away Gentlemen .
This fit with the Doctor ,
Hath mended me past expectation .
OSir Diaphanous , ha' you done ?
I ha' brought it .
That 's well .
But who shall carry it now ?
A Friend :
I 'll find a Friend to carry it ; Mr. Bias here
Will not deny me that .
What is't ?
To carry
A Challenge I have writ unto the Captain .
Faith , but I will , Sir , you shall pardon me
For a twi-reason of State : I 'll bear no Challenges ;
I will not hazard my Lord 's favour so ;
Or forfeit mine own judgment with his Honour ,
To turn a Ruffian : I have to commend me
Nought but his Lordships good opinion ;
And to't my Kallygraphy , a fair Hand ,
Fit for a Secretary : Now you know , a Man 's Hand
Being his executing part in fight ,
Is more obnoxious to the common peril ?
You shall not fight , Sir , you shall only search
My Antagonist ; commit us fairly there
Upo ' the Ground on equal terms .
O , Sir !
But if my Lord should hear I stood at end
Of any quarrel , 'twere an end of me
In a state course ! I ha' read the Politicks ;
And heard th ' opinions of our best Divines .
The Gentleman has reason ! Where was first
The birth of your acquaintance ?
or the Cradle
Of your strict friendship made ?
We met in France , Sir .
In France ! that Garden of humanity ,
The very Seed-plot of all courtesies :
I wonder that your friendship suck 'd that Aliment ,
The Milk of France ; and see this sowre effect
It doth produce , 'gainst all the sweets of travel :
There , every Gentleman professing Arms ,
Thinks he is bound in Honour to imbrace
The bearing of a Challenge for another ,
Without or questioning the cause , or asking
Least colour of a reason .
There 's no Cowardice ,
No Poultrounery , like urging why ?
wherefore ?
But carry a Challenge , die , and do the thing .
Why , hear you , Mr. Compass , I but crave
Your Ear in private ?
I would carry his Challenge ,
If I but hop 'd your Captain angry enough
To kill him : For ( to tell you truth ) this Knight ,
Is an impertinent in Court , ( we think him : )
And troubles my Lord 's Lodgings , and his Table
With frequent , and unnecessary visits ,
Which we ( the better sort of Servants ) like not :
Being his Fellows in all other places ,
But at our Master 's board ; and we disdain
To do those servile offices , oft-times ,
His foolish Pride , and Empire will exact ,
Against the heart , or humour of a Gentleman .
Truth , Mr. Bias , I 'd not ha' you think
I speak to flatter you : but you are one
O' the deepest Politicks I ever met ,
And the most subtilly rational .
I admire you .
But do not you conceive in such a case ,
That you are accessory to his death ,
From whom you carry a Challenge with such purpose .
Sir , the corruption of one thing in nature ,
Is held the Generation of another ;
And therefore , I had as lieve be accessory
Unto his death , as to his life .
A new
Moral Philosophy too ! you 'll carry 't then .
If I were sure 't would not incense his choler
To beat the Messenger .
O' I 'll secure you ,
You shall deliver it in my Lodging , safely ,
And do your Friend a service worthy thanks .
I 'll venture it , upon so good Induction ,
To rid the Court of an Impediment ,
This baggage Knight .
Peace to you all , Gentlemen ,
Save to this Mushroom ; who I hear is menacing
Me with a Challenge : which I come to anticipate ,
And save the Law a labour .
Will you fight , Sir ?
Yes , in my Shirt .
O , that 's to save your Doublet ;
I know it a Court-trick ! you had rather have
An Ulcer in your Body , than a Pink
More i' your Clothes .
Captain , you are a Coward ,
If you 'll not fight i' your Shirt .
Sir , I do not mean
To put it off for that , nor yet my Doublet :
Yo ' have cause to call me Coward , that more fear
The stroke of the common , and life-giving Air ,
Than all your Fury , and the Panoply .
( Which is at best , but a thin Linnen Armour . )
I think a Cup of generous Wine were better ,
Than fighting i' your Shirts .
Sir , Sir , my Valour ,
It is a Valour of another nature ,
Than to be mended by a Cup of Wine .
I should be glad to hear of any Valours ,
Differing in kind ; who have known hitherto ,
Only one Vertue , they call Fortitude ,
Worthy the name of Valour .
Which , who hath not ,
Is justly thought a Coward : And he is such .
O , you ha' read the Play there , the New Inn ,
Of Johnson 's , that decries all other Valour
But
The Magnifick Lady .
499
But what is for the publick .
I do that too ,
But did not learn it there ; I think no valour
Lies for a private cause .
Sir , I 'll redargue you ,
By disputation .
O let 's hear this !
I long to hear a Man dispute in his Shirt
Of Valour , and his Sword drawn in his Hand .
His Valour will take cold ; put on your Doublet .
His Valour will keep cold , you are deceiv 'd ;
And relish much the sweeter in our Ears :
It may be too , i' the ordinance of nature .
Their Valours are not yet so combatant ,
Or truly antagonistick , as to fight ;
But may admit to hear of some divisions ,
Of Fortitude , may put 'em off their quarrel .
I would have no Man think me so ungover n 'd ,
Or subject to my passion , but I can
Read him a Lecture 'twixt my undertakings ,
And executions : I do know all kinds
Of doing the business , which the Town calls Valour .
Yes , he has read the Town , Town-top 's his Author !
Your first ?
Is a rash head-long unexperience .
Which is in Children , Fools , or your Street-Gallants
O' the first head .
A pretty kind of Valour !
Commend him , he will spin it out in 's Shirt ,
Fine , as that Thread .
The next , an indiscreet
Presumption , grounded upon often scapes .
Or th ' insufficiency of Adversaries :
And this is in your common fighting Brothers .
Your old Perdu 's , who ( after a time ) do think ,
The one , that they are Shot-free ; the other Sword-free ,
Your third ?
Is nought but an excess of choller ,
That reigns in testy old Men ?
Noble Mens Porters ,
And self-conceited Poets .
And is rather
A peevishness , than any part of Valour .
He but rehearses , he concludes no Valour .
A history of Distempers , as they are practis 'd ,
His Harangue undertaketh , and no more .
Your next ?
Is a dull desperate resolving .
In case of some necessitous misery , or
Incumbent mischief .
Narrowness of Mind ,
Or Ignorance being the root of it .
Which thou shalt find in Gamesters , quite blown up .
Bankrupt Merchants , undiscovered Traytors .
Or your exemplified Malefactors ,
That have surviv 'd their infamy , and punishment .
One that hath lost his Ears , by a just sentence
O' the Star-Chamber , a right valiant Knave ? ?
And is a Histrionical contempt ,
Of what a Man fears most ; it being a mischief
In his own apprehension unavoidable .
Which is in Cowards wounded mortally ,
Or Thieves adjudg 'd to die .
This is a Valour ,
I should desire much to see incourag 'd :
As being a special entertainment
For our rogue People ; and make oft good sport
Unto 'em , from the Gallows to the Ground .
But mine is a judicial resolving ,
Or liberal undertaking of a danger .
?
That might be avoided .
I , and with assurance ,
That it is found in Noble-men , and Gentlemen ,
Of the best sheaf .
Who having Lives to lose ,
Like private Men , have yet a world of Honour ,
And publick Reputation to defend .
?
Which in the brave historified Greeks ,
And Romans you shall read of .
And ( no doubt )
May in our Alder-men meet it , and their Deputies ,
The Soldiers of the City , valiant Blades ,
Who ( rather than their Houses should be ransack 'd )
Would fight it out , like so many wild Beasts ;
Not for the fury they are commonly arm 'd with :
But the close manner of their fight , and custom ,
Of joyning Head to Head , and Foot to Foot .
And which of these so well-prest resolutions
Am I to encounter now ?
For commonly ,
Men that have so much choise before 'em , have
Some trouble to resolve of any one .
There are three Valours yet , which Sir Diaphanous ,
Hath ( with his leave ) not touch 'd .
Yea ; which are those ?
He perks at that !
Nay , he does more , he chatters .
A Philosophical contempt of Death ,
Is one : Then an infused kind of Valour ,
Wrought in us by our Genii , or good Spirits ;
Of which the gallant Ethnicks had deep sense :
Who generally held , that no great States-man ,
Scholar , or Soldier , ere did any thing
Sine divino aliquo afflatu .
But there 's a Christian Valour , 'bove these too .
Which is a quiet patient toleration ,
Of whatsoever the malicious World
With Injury doth unto you ; and consists
In passion , more than action , Sir Diaphanous .
Sure , I do take mine to be Christian Valour .
?
You may mistake though .
Can you justifie
On any cause , this seeking to deface ,
The divine Image in a Man ?
O , Sir !
Let 'em alone : Is not Diaphonous
As much a divine Image , as is Ironside ?
Let Images fight , if they will fight , a God 's Name .
WHere 's Mr. Needle ?
Saw you Mr. Needle ?
We are undone .
What ails the frantick Nurse ?
My Mrs. is undone , she 's crying out !
Where is this Man trow ?
Mr. Needle ?
Run for the Party , Mrs. Chair , the Mid-wife .
Nay , look how the Man stands , as he were gok't !
She 's lost , if you not haste away the party .
Where is the Doctor ?
Where a scoffing Man is .
And his Apothecary , little better ;
They laugh and jeer at all : will you dispatch ?
And fetch the party quickly to our Mistriss :
We are all undone ! The Tympany will out else .
News , news , good news , better than butter 'd news !
My Niece is found with Child , the Doctor tells me ,
And fal 'n in labour .
How ?
The Portion 's paid !
The Portion ?
O' the Captain ! Is he here ?
H' has spi 'd your Swords out ! put 'em up , put up ,
Yo ' have driven him hence ; and yet your quarrel 's ended .
In a most strange discovery .
Of light Gold .
And crack't within the Ring .
I take the Omen ,
As a good Omen .
Then put up your Sword ,
And on your Doublet .
Give the Captain thanks .
I had been slur 'd else .
Thank you noble Captain :
Your quarrelling caus 'd all this .
Where 's Compass ?
Gone ,
Shrunk hence ; contracted to his Center , I fear .
The slip is his then .
I had like t 'have been
Abus 'd i' the business , had the slip slur 'd on me ,
A counterfeit .
Sir , we are all abus 'd :
As many as were brought on to be Suitors ;
And we will joyn in thanks , all to the Captain ,
And to his fortune that so brought us off .
C H O R U S.
THis was a pittiful poor shift o ' your Poet , Boy ,
to make his prime Woman with Child , and fall
in labour , just to compose a quarrel .
With whose borrowed Ears , have you heard ,
Sir , all this while , that you can mistake the current of
500 The Magnifick Lady .
her being with Child from the very beginning ; for it
by the Author , till the Quarrel , which was but the ac -
cidental Cause , hastned on the Discovery of it , in oc -
casioning her affright , which made her fall into her
Throws presently , and within that compass of time al-
lowed to the Comedy ; wherein the Poet exprest his
prime Artifice , rather than any Errour , that the dete-
ction of her being with Child , should determine the
Quarrel , which had produc 'd it .
The Boy is too hard for you .
Brother Damplay ,
best mark the Play , and let him alone .
I care not for marking the Play : I 'll damn it ,
talk , and do that I come for .
I will not have Gentle -
men lose their Privilege , nor I my self my Prerogative ,
for ne 'er an over-grown or superannuated Poet of 'em
He shall not give me the Law : I will censure ,
and be witty , and take my Tabacco , and enjoy my
Magna Charta of Reprehension , as my Predecessors have
done before me .
Even to licence , and absurdity .
Not now , because the Gentlewoman is in travel :
and the Midwife may come on the sooner , to put her
and us out of our pain .
VVell , look to your Business afterward , Boy , that
all things be clear , and come properly forth , suited , and
set together ; for I will search what follows , severely ,
and to the nail .
Let your Nail run smooth then , and not scratch ;
lest the Author be bold to pare it to the quick , and make
it smart : you 'll find him as severe as your self .
A shrewd Boy ! and has me every where .
The
Midwife is come , she has made haste .
STay , Mr. Needle , you do prick too fast
Upo ' the Business : I must take some breath :
Lend me my Stool ; you ha' drawn a Stitch upon me ,
In faith , Son Needle , with your haste .
Good Mother , piece up this Breach : I 'll gi' you
a new Gown ,
A new Silk Grogoran Gown .
I 'll do 't , Mother .
What 'll you do ?
You ha' done too much already ,
VVith your Prick-seam , and through-stitch , Mr. Needle .
I pray you sit not fabling here old Tales ,
Good Mother Chair , the Midwife , but come up .
HOw now , Nurse ?
where 's my Lady ?
In her Chamber ,
Lock 'd up , I think : she 'll speak with no body .
Knows she o ' this accident ?
Alas , Sir ! no :
Would she might never know it .
I think her Ladiship
Too vertuous , and too nobly innocent ,
To have a hand in so ill-form 'd a Business .
Your Thought , Sir , is a brave Thought , and a safe one ;
The Child now to be born , is not more free
From the aspersion of all spot , than she .
She have her Hand in plot 'gainst Mr. Practice ,
If there were nothing else , whom she so loves ,
Cries up and values ?
knows to be a Man
Mark 'd out for a Chief Justice in his Cradle ,
Or a Lord Paramount , the Head o ' the Hall ,
The Top or the Top-gallant of our Law ?
Assure your self , she could not so deprave
The rectitude of her Judgment , to wish you
Unto a VVife might prove your Infamy ,
VVhom she esteem 'd that part o ' the Commonwealth ,
And had up for Honour to her Blood .
I must confess a great Beholdingness
Unto her Ladiships Offer , and good VVishes .
But the truth is , I never had affection ,
Or any liking , to this Niece of hers .
You foresaw somewhat then ?
I had my Notes ,
And my Prognosticks .
You read Almanacks ,
And study 'em to some purpose , I believe .
I do confess , I do believe , and pray too ,
According to the Planets , at some times .
And do observe the Sign in making Love ?
As in Phlebotomy .
And chuse your Mistris
By the good Days , and leave her by the bad ?
I do , and I do not .
A little more
VVould fetch all his Astronomy from Allestree .
I tell you , Mr. Compass , as my Friend ,
And under Seal , I cast mine Eye long since
Upo ' the other VVench , my Ladies VVoman ,
Another manner of Piece for Handsomness ,
Than is the Niece , ( but that is sub sigillo ,
And as I give it you ) in hope o ' your aid ,
And counsel in the Business .
You need counsel ?
The only famous Counsel o ' the Kingdom ,
And in all Courts ?
That is a Jeer in faith ,
VVorthy your Name , and your Profession too ,
Sharp Mr. Practice .
No, upo ' my Law ,
As I am a Bencher , and now double Reader ,
I meant in meer simplicity of Request .
If you meant so .
Th' affairs are now perplex 'd ,
And full of trouble ; give 'em breath and settling ,
I 'll do my best .
But in mean time do you
Prepare the Parson .
( I am glad to know
This ; for my self lik 'd the young Maid before ,
And lov 'd her too . )
Ha' you a Licence ?
No ;
But I can fetch one straight .
Do , do , and mind
The Parson 's Pint t ' ingage him ?
the Business ;
A knitting Cup there must be .
I shall do it .
TIs an Affront from you , Sir ; you here brought me
Unto my Ladies , and to woo a Wife ,
VVhich since is prov 'd a crack 'd Commodity :
She hath broke Bulk too soon .
No fault of mine ,
If she be crack 'd in pieces , or broke round :
It was my Sister 's Fault , that owns the House ,
Where she hath got her clap , makes all this noise .
I keep her Portion safe , that is not scatter 'd ;
The Moneys rattle not , nor are they thrown ,
To make a Muss yet 'mong the gamesom Suitors .
Can you endure that Flout , close Mr. Bias ,
And have been so bred in the Politicks ?
The Injury is done you , and by him only :
He lent you Imprest-money , and upbraids it ;
Furnish 'd you for the Wooing , and now waves you .
That makes me to expostulate the VVrong
So with him , and resent it as I do .
But do it home then .
Sir , my Lord shall know it .
And all the Lords o ' the Court too .
VVhat a Moath
You are , Sir Interest ! Int .
Wherein , I entreat you ,
Sweet Mr. Bias ?
To draw in young Statesmen ,
And Heirs of Policy , into the Noose
Of an infamous Matrimony .
Yes ,
Infamous , quasi in communem famam :
And Matrimony , quasi Matter of Money .
Learnedly urg 'd , my cunning Mr. Bias .
With his lewd , known , and prostituted Niece .
My known , and prostitute ! how you mistake ,
And
The Magnifick Lady .
501
And run upon a false ground , Mr. Bias !
( Your Lords will do me right . )
Now she is prostitute ,
And that I know it , ( please you understand me )
I mean to keep the Portion in my Hands ,
And pay no Moneys .
Mark you that , Don Bias ?
And you shall still remain in Bonds to him ,
For wooing Furniture , and Imprest-Charges .
Good Mr. Compass , for the Sums he has had
Of me , I do acquit him ; they are his own .
Here , before you , I do release him .
Good !
O Sir ! Com .
' Slid , take it : I do witness it :
He cannot hurl away his Money better .
He shall get so much , Sir , by my acquaintance ,
To be my Friend : and now report to his Lords
As I deserve , no otherwise .
But well ;
And I will witness it , and to the value :
Four hundred is the price , if I mistake not ,
Of your true Friend in Court .
Take hands , you ha' bought him ,
And bought him cheap .
I am his Worships Servant .
And you his Slave , Sir Moath , seal 'd and deliver 'd .
Ha' you not studied the Court-Complement ?
Here are a pair of Humours reconcil 'd now ,
That Money held at distance , or their Thoughts ,
Baser than Money .
OUt thou Caitiff VVitch !
Bawd , Begger , Gipsey ; any thing indeed ,
But honest Woman .
What you please , Dame Polish ,
My Ladies Stroaker .
What is here to do ?
The Gossips out ! Pol .
Thou art a Traytor to me ,
An Eve , the Apul , and the Serpent too ;
A Viper , that hast eat a Passage through me ,
Through mine own Bowels , by thy wretchlesness .
What frantick Fit is this ?
I 'll step aside ,
And hearken to it .
Did I trust thee , Wretch ,
With such a Secret , of that consequence ,
Did so concern me , and my Child , our Livelihood ,
And Reputation ?
And hast thou undone us ,
By thy Connivence , nodding in a Corner ,
And suffering her be got with Child so basely ?
Sleepy unlucky Hag ! Thou Bird of Night ,
And all Mischance to me .
Good Lady Empress !
Had I the keeping of your Daughters Clicket
In charge ?
was that committed to my trust ?
Her Daughter ! Pol .
Softly , Devil , not so loud :
You 'ld ha' the House hear , and be witness , would you ?
Let all the World be witness .
Afore I 'll
Endure the Tyranny of such a Tongue ? ?
And such a Pride ?
What will you do ?
Tell truth ,
And shame the She-man-devil in puff 'd Sleeves ;
Run any hazard , by revealing all
Unto my Lady : how you chang 'd the Cradles ,
And chang 'd the Children in 'em .
Not so high !
Calling your Daughter Pleasance there Placentia ,
And my true Mistris by the name of Pleasance .
A horrid Secret this ! worth the discovery .
And must you be thus loud ?
I will be louder ,
And cry it through the House , through every Room ,
And every Office of the Lawndry-maids ,
Till it be born hot to my Ladies Ears .
Ere I will live in such a slavery ,
I 'll do away my self .
Didst thou not swear
To keep it secret ?
and upon what Book ?
( I do remember now ) The Practice of Piety .
It was a Practice of Impiety ,
Out of your wicked Forge , I know it now ,
My Conscience tells me .
First , against the Infants ,
To rob them o ' their Names , and their true Parents ;
T' abuse the Neighbourhood , keep them in errour ;
But most my Lady : She has the main wrong :
And I will let her know it instantly .
Repentance ( if it be true ) nere comes too late .
What have I done ?
Conjur 'd a Spirit up ,
I sha' not lay again ?
Drawn on a Danger ,
And Ruine on my self thus , by provoking
A peevish Fool , whom nothing will pray off ,
Or satisfie , I fear ?
Her Patience stirr 'd ,
Is turn 'd to Fury .
I have run my Bark
On a sweet Rock , by mine own Arts and Trust ;
And must get off again , or dash in pieces .
This was a Business worth the listning after .
OMr. Compass , did you see my Mother ?
Mistris Placentia , my Ladies Niece ,
Is newly brought to Bed o ' the bravest Boy !
Will you go see it ?
First , I 'll know the Father ,
Ere I approach these Hazards .
Mistris Midwife
Has promis 'd to find out a Father for it ,
If there be need .
She may the safelier do 't ,
By vertue of her Place .
But pretty Pleasance ,
I have a News for you , I think will please you .
What is't , Mr. Compass ?
Stay , you must
Deserve it , ere you know it .
Where 's my Lady ?
Retir 'd unto her Chamber , and shut up .
She hears o ' none o ' this yet ?
VVell , do you
Command the Coach , and fit your self to travel
A little way with me .
VVhither , for Gods sake ?
Where I 'll entreat you , not to your loss , believe it .
If you dare trust your self .
With you the world ore .
The News will well requite the Pains , I assure you .
And i' this Tumult you will not be mist .
Command the Coach ; it is an instant Business ,
VVu ' not be done without you .
Parson Palate ,
Most opportunely met ; step to my Chamber ;
I 'll come to you presently .
There is a Friend ,
Or two , will entertain you .
Mr. Practice ,
Ha' you the Licence ?
HEre it is .
Let 's see it :
Your name 's not in't .
I 'll fill that presently .
It has the Seal , which is the main , and registred .
The Clerk knows me , and trusts me .
Ha' you the Parson ?
They say he 's here , he 'pointed to come hither .
I would not have him seen here for a VVorld ,
To breed suspicion .
Do you intercept him ,
And prevent that .
But take your Licence with you ,
And fill the Blank ; or leave it here with me ,
I 'll do it for you ; stay you with us at his Church ,
Behind the Old Exchange , we 'll come i' th ' Coach ,
And meet you there within this Quarter at least .
I am much bound unto you , Mr. Compass ;
You have all the Law , and Parts of Squire Practice
For ever at your use .
I 'll tell you news too :
Sir , your Reversion 's faln ; Thin-wit 's dead ,
Surveyor of the Projects general .
VVhen died he ?
E'en this morning ; I receiv 'd it
From a right hand .
Conceal it , Mr. Practice ,
And mind the main affair you are in hand with .
The Coach is ready , Sir .
' Tis well , fair Pleasance ,
Though now we shall not use it ; bid the Coachman
Drive to the Parish-Church , and stay about there ,
Till Mr. Practice come to him , and employ him :
I have a Licence now , which must have entry
Before
502 The Magnifick Lady .
Before my Lawyers .
Noble Parson Palate ,
Thou shalt be a Mark advanc't : here 's a Piece ,
And do a feat for me .
What , Mr. Compass ?
But run the words of Matrimony over
My Head , and Mrs. Pleasances in my Chamber :
There 's Captain Ironside to be a Witness :
And here 's a License to secure thee .
Parson !
What do you stick at ?
It is after-noon , Sir ,
Directly against the Canon of the Church :
You know it , Mr. Compass : and beside ,
I am ingag 'd unto our worshipful Friend ,
The learned Mr. Practice , in that business .
Come on , ingage your self : Who shall be able
To say you married us , but i' the morning ,
The most canonical miuute o ' the day ,
If you affirm it ?
That 's a spic 'd excuse ,
And shews you have set the Canon Law , before
Any profession else , of Love , or Friendship .
Come Mrs. Pleasance , we cannot prevail
With th ' rigid Parson here ; but , Sir , I 'll keep you
Lock 'd in my Lodging , 'till 't be done elsewhere ,
And under fear of Ironside .
Do you hear , Sir ?
No, no , it matters not .
Can you think , Sir ,
I would deny you any thing ?
not to loss
Of both my Livings : I will do it for you ;
Ha' you a Wedding Ring ?
I , and a Poesie :
Annulus hic nobis , quod scit uterque dabit .
Good !
This Ring will give you what you both desire .
I 'll make the whole House chant it , and the Parish .
Why , well said Parson .
Now , to you my news .
That comprehend my reasons , Mrs. Pleasance .
GO , get a Nurse , procure her at what rate
You can : and out o ' th ' House with it , Son
It is a bad Commodity .
Good Mother ,
I know it , but the best would now be made on't .
And shall : you should not fret so , Mrs. Polish ,
Nor you Dame Keep; my Daughter shall do well ,
When she has tane my Cawdle .
I ha' known
Twenty such breaches piec'd up , and made whole ,
Without a bum of noise .
You two fall out ?
And tear up one another ?
Blessed Woman ?
Blest be the Peace-maker .
The Pease-dresser !
I 'll hear no Peace from her .
I have been wrong 'd ,
So has my Lady , my good Ladies Worship ,
And I will right her , hoping she 'll right me .
Good gentle Keep , I pray thee Mistriss Nurse ,
Pardon my passion , I was misadvis 'd ,
Be thou yet better , by this grave sage Woman ,
Who is the Mother of Matrons , and great Persons ,
And knows the World .
I do confess , she knows
Something ?
and I know something .
Put your somethings
Together then .
I , here 's a chance fal 'n out
You cannot help ; less can this Gentlewoman ;
I can and will , for both .
First , I have sent
By-chop away ; the cause gone , the fame ceaseth .
Then by my Cawdle , and my Cullice , I set
My Daughter on her Feet , about the House here :
She 's young , and must stir somewhat for necessity ,
Her youth will bear it out .
She shall pretend ,
T' have had a fit o ' the Mother : there is all .
If you have but a Secretary Landress ,
To blanch the Linnen ?
Take the former counsels
Into you ; keep them safe i' your own Breasts ,
And make your Market of 'em at the highest .
Will you go peach , and cry your self a Fool
At Granam 's Cross ?
be laugh 'd at , and despis 'd ?
Betray a purpose , which the Deputy
Of a double Ward , or scarce his Alderman ,
With twelve of the wisest Questmen could find out ,
Imployed by the Authority of the City ?
Come , come , be friends : and keep these Women-matters ,
Smock-secrets to our selves , in our own verge .
We shall mar all , if once we ope the mysteries
O' the Tyring-house , and tell what 's done within :
No Theaters are more cheated with apparances ,
Or these Shop-lights , than th ' Ages , and Folk in them ,
That seem most curious .
Breath of an Oracle !
You shall be my dear Mother ; wisest Woman
That ever tip 'd her Tongue , with point of Reasons ,
To turn her hearers ! Mistriss Keep , relent ,
I did abuse thee ; I confess to Penance :
And on my Knees ask thee forgiveness .
Rise ,
She doth begin to melt , I see it .
?
Nothing
Griev 'd me so much , as when you call 'd me Bawd :
Witch did not trouble me , nor Gipsie ; no ,
Nor Beggar .
But a Bawd , was such a name !
No more rehearsals ; repetitions
Make things the worse : The more we stir (you know
The Proverb , and it signifies a ) stink .
What 's done , and dead , let it be buried .
New hours will fit fresh handles , to new thoughts .
To them , the Lady :
and after Practice .
RUn to the Church , Sirrah .
Get all the Drun-
kards
To ring the Bells , and jangle them for joy
My Niece hath brought an Heir unto the House ,
A lusty Boy .
Where 's my Sister Loadstone ?
A sleep at afternoons ! It is not wholsome ;
Against all rules of Physick , Lady Sister .
The little Doctor will not like it .
Our Niece
Is new deliver 'd of a chopping Child ,
Can call the Father by the name already ,
If it but ope the Mouth round .
Mr. Compass ,
He is the Man , they say , fame gives it out ,
Hath done that act of honour to our House ,
And friendship to pomp out a Son , and Heir ,
That shall inherit nothing , surely nothing
From me , at least .
I come t ' invite your Ladiship
To be a witness ; I will be your Partner ,
And give it a Horn-spoon , and a Treen-dish ;
Bastard , and Beggars Badges , with a Blanket
For Dame the Doxey to march round the Circuit ,
With Bag , and Baggage .
Thou malicious Knight ,
Envious Sir Moath , that eats on that which feeds thee ,
And frets her goodness , that sustains thy being ;
What company of Mankind would own thy Brother-
hood ,
But as thou hast a Title to her Blood ,
Whom thy ill nature hath chose out t ' insult on ,
And vex thus , for an accident in her House ,
As if it were her crime ! Good innocent Lady ,
Thou shew 'st thy self a true corroding Vermine ,
Such as thou art .
Why , gentle Mr. Compass ?
Because I wish you joy of your young Son ,
And Heir to the House , you ha' sent us ?
I ha' sent you ?
I know not what I shall do .
Come in Friends :
Madam , I pray you be pleas 'd to trust your self
Unto our company .
I did that too late ,
Which brought on this calamity upon me ,
With all the infamy I hear ; your Soldier ,
That swaggering Guest .
Who is return 'd here to you ,
Your
The Magnetick Lady .
503
Your vowed Friend , and Servant , comes to sup with you ,
So we do all ; and I 'll prove he hath deserv 'd
That special respect , and favour from you ,
As not your Fortunes , with your self to boot ,
Cast on a Feather-bed , and spread o ' th ' Sheets
Under a brace of your best Persian Carpets ,
Were scarce a price to thank his happy merit .
What impudence is this ?
can you indure
To hear it , Sister ?
Yes , and you shall hear it ;
Who will indure it worse .
What deserves he ,
In your opinion , Madam , or weigh 'd judgment ,
That things thus hanging ( as they do in doubt )
Suspended , and suspected , all involv 'd ,
And wrapt in error , can resolve the Knot ?
Redintegrate the fame , first of your House ?
Restore your Ladiships quiet ?
render then
Your Niece a Virgin , and unvitiated ?
And make all plain , and perfect ( as it was )
A practcie to betray you , and your name ?
He speaks impossibilities .
Here he stands ,
Whose Fortune hath done this , and you must thank him .
To what you call his swaggering , we owe all this .
And that it may have credit with you , Madam ,
Here is your Niece , whom I have married , witness
These Gentlemen , the Knight , Captain , and Parson ,
And this grave Politick Tell-troth of the Court .
What 's she that I call Niece then ?
Polish 's Daughter ;
Her Mother Goodwy ' Polish hath confess 'd it
To Grannum Keep , the Nurse , how they did change
The Children in their Cradles .
To what purpose ?
To get the Portion , or some part of it ,
Which you must now disburse intire to me , Sir ,
If I but gain her Ladiships consent .
I bid God give you joy , if this be true .
As true it is , Lady , Lady , i' th ' Song .
The Portion 's mine , with Interest , Sir Moath ;
I will not 'bate you a single Harrington ,
Of Interest upon Interest .
In mean time ,
I do commit you to the Guard of Ironside ,
My Brother here , Captain Rud-hudibras :
From whom I will expect you , or your Ransom .
Sir , you must prove it , and the possibility ,
Ere I believe it .
For the possibility ,
I leave to trial .
Truth shall speak it self .
O , Mr. Practice , did you meet the Coach ?
Yes , Sir , but empty .
Why , I sent it for you .
The business is dispatch 'd here , ere you come ;
Come in , I 'll tell you how : you are a Man
Will look for satisfaction , and must have it .
So do we all , and long to hear the right .
C H O R U S.
TRoth , I am one of those that labour with the
same longing , for it is almost pucker 'd , and
pull 'd into that knot , by your Poet , which I cannot
easily , with all the strength of my imagination , unty .
Like enough , nor is it in your office to be trou-
bled or perplexed with it , but to sit still , and expect .
The
more your Imagination busies it self , the more it is in-
tangled , especially if ( as I told in the beginning ) you
happen on the wrong end .
He hath said sufficient , Brother Damplay ; our
parts that are the Spectators , or should hear a Come -
dy , are to await the process , and events of things , as the
Poet presents them , not as we would corruptly fashion
We come here to behold Plays , and censure
them , as they are made , and fitted for us ; not to be-
slave our own thoughts , with censorious Spittle tem -

Why , here his Play might have ended , if he
would ha' let it ; and have spar 'd us the vexation of a
That conjecture is a kind of Figure-flinging , or
throwing the Dice , for a meaning was never in the Po-
ets purpose perhaps .
delight , till some unexpected , and new encounter break
out to rectifie all , and make good the Conclusion .
Which , ending here , would have shown dull ,
flat , and unpointed ; without any shape , or sharpness ,
Brother Damplay .
Well , let us expect then : And wit be with us ,
o ' the Poets part .
TRoth , Mr. Item , here 's a House divided ,
And quarter 'd into parts , by your Doctors En-
H' has cast out such aspersions on my Ladies
Niece here , of having had a Child ; as hardly
Will be wip 'd off , I doubt .
Why , is't not true ?
True ! did you think it ?
Was she not in labour ?
The Mid-wife sent for ?
There 's your error now !
Yo ' ha' drunk o ' the same Water .
I believ 'd it ,
And gave it out too .
More you wrong 'd the Party ;
She had no such thing about her , innocent Creature !
What had she then ?
only a fit o ' the Mother !
They burnt old Shooes , Goose-feathers , Assa f?tida ,
A few Horn-shavings , with a Bone , or two ,
And she is well again , about the House .
Is't possible ?
See it , and then report it .
Our Doctors Urinal-judgment is half crack 'd then .
Crack 't i' the case , most hugely , with my Lady ,
And sad Sir Moath , her Brother ; who is now
Under a Cloud a little .
Of what ?
Disgrace ?
He is committed to Rud-hudibras ,
The Captain Ironside , upon displeasure ,
From Mr. Compass , but it will blow off .
The Doctor shall reverse his instantly ,
And set all right again : if you 'll assist
But in a toy , Squire Needle , comes i' my Noddle now .
Good , Needle and Noddle ! what may 't be ?
Ilong for't .
Why , but to go to Bed : fain a distemper
Of walking i' your sleep , or talking in't
A little idly , but so much , as on it
The Doctor may have ground to raise a cure
For 's Reputation .
Any thing , to serve
The worship o ' the Man I love and honour .
O ! gi' you joy Madamoiselle Compass !
You are his Whirl-pool now : all-to-be married ,
Against your Mothers leave , and without counsel !
H' has fish 'd fair , and caught a Frog , I fear it .
What Fortune ha' you to bring him in Dower ?
You can tell Stories now : you know a world
Of Secrets to discover .
I know nothing
But what is told me ; nor can I discover
Any thing .
No, you shall not , I 'll take order .
Go ,
504 The Magnetick Lady .
Go , get you in there : It is Ember-week !
I 'll keep you fasting from his Flesh a while .
See , who 's here ?
she 'has been with my Lady ;
who kist her , all to kist her , twice or thrice .
And call 'd her Niece again , and view 'd her Linnen .
You ha' done a Miracle , Mother Chair .
Not I ,
My Cawdle has done it .
Thank my Cawdle heartily .
It shall be thank 'd , and you too , wisest Mother ;
You shall have a new , brave , four-pound Beaver-Hat ,
Set with enamel 'd Studs , as mine is here :
And a right pair of Christal Spectacles ,
Christal o ' th ' Rock , thou mighty Mother of Dames ,
Hung in an Ivory Case , at a Gold Belt ,
And Silver Bells to gingle , as you puss
Before your fifty Daughters in procession
To Church , or from the Church .
Thanks , Mrs. Polish .
She does deserve as many Pensions
As there be pieces in a ?
Maiden-head ,
Were I a Prince to give 'em .
Come sweet Charge ,
You shall present your self about the House , be confi-
dent , and bear up ; you shall be seen .
WHat ?
I can make you amends , my learned
Counsel ,
And satisfie a greater Injury
To chased Mr. Practice .
Who would think
That you could be thus testy ?
A grave heap !
Giv'n over to the study of our Laws .
And the prime honours of the Common-wealth .
And you to mind a Wife .
What should you do
With such a toy as a Wife , that might distract you ,
Or hinder you i' your Course ?
He shall not think on't .
I will make over to you my Possession ,
Of that same place is fall 'n (you know ) to satisfie
Surveyor of the Projects general .
And that 's an office you know how to stir in .
And make your profits of .
Which are ( indeed )
The ends of a Gown 'd-man : Shew your activity ,
And how you are built for business .
I accept it
As a Possession , be 't but a Reversion .
You first told Me 'twas a Possession .
I ,
I told you that I heard so .
All is one ,
He 'll make Reversion a Possession quickly .
But I must have a general Release from you .
Do one , I 'll do the other .
It 's a match
Before my Brother Ironside .
' Tis done .
We two are reconcil 'd then .
To a Lawyer ,
That can make use of a place , any half Title
Is better than a Wife .
And will save charges
Of Coaches , Vellute Gowns , and Cut-work Smocks .
He is to occupy an office wholly .
True , I must talk with you nearer , Mr. Practice ,
About recovery o ' my Wives Portion ,
What way I were best to take .
The plainest way .
What 's that , for plainness ?
Sue him at Common-Law :
You can prove your Marriage ?
We 'll talk of it within , and hear my Lady .
I 'm sure , the Rogue o ' the House went all that
way ;
She was with Child , and Mr. Compass got it .
Why , that you see is manifestly false ,
H' has married the other ; our true Niece , he says :
He would not woe 'em both : he is not such
A Stallion , to leap all .
Again , no Child
Appears , that I can find with all my search ,
And strictest way of inquiry , I have made
Through all my Family .
A fit o ' the Mother ,
The Women say she had , which the Mid-wife cur 'd ,
With burning Bones and Feathers : Here 's the Doctor .
O , noble Doctor , did not you , and your Item ,
Tell me our Niece was in labour ?
If I did ,
What follows ?
And that Mother Mid-night
Was sent for ?
So she was ; and is i' the House still .
But here has a noise been since , she was deliver 'd
of a brave Boy , and Mr. Compass 's getting .
I know no rattle of Gossips , nor their noises .
I hope you take not me for a Pimp-errant ,
To deal in Smock affairs ?
Where 's the Patient ?
The infirm Man , I was sent for , Squire Needle ?
Is Needle sick ?
My ' Pothecary tells me
He is in danger ; how is 't Tim ?
where is he ?
I cannot hold him down .
He 's up , and walks ,
And talks in his perfect sleep , with his Eyes shut ,
As sensibly , as he were broad awake .
See , here he comes .
He 's fast asleep , observe him .
He 'll tell us wonders .
What do these Women
here ?
HUnting a Man half naked ?
you are fine Beagles !
You 'd have his Dousets .
I ha' Linnen Breeks on .
He hears , but he sees nothing .
Yes , I see
Who hides the Treasure yonder .
Ha ?
what Treasure ?
If you ask questions , he 'wakes presently :
And then you 'll hear no more , till his next fit .
And whom she hides it for .
Do you mark , Sir ?
A fine she Spirit it is , an Indian Mag-pie .
She was an Aldermans Widow , and fell in love
With our Sir Moath , my Ladies Brother .
( Hear you ? )
And she has hid an Aldermans Estate ;
Dropt through her Bill in little holes , i' the Garden ,
And scrapes Earth over 'em ; where none can spy
But I , who see all by the Gloworms light ,
That creeps before .
I knew the Gentlewoman ;
Alderman Parrot 's Widow , a fine Speaker ,
As any was i' the Clothing , or the Bevy ;
She did become her Scarlet , and black Velvet ,
Her green , and purple ? ? ?
Save thy colours , Rainbow ,
Or she will run thee over , and all thy lights .
She dwelt in Doo-little Lane , a top o ' the Hill there ;
I ' the round Cage , was after Sir Chime Squirrel 's .
She would eat nought but Almonds , I assure you .
Would thou had 'st a Dose of Pills , a double Dose ,
O' the best Purge , to make thee turn Tail , tother way .
You are a foul mouth 'd , purging , absurd Doctor ;
I tell you true , and I did long to tell it you .
You
The Magnetick Lady .
505
You ha' spread a scandal i' my Ladies House here ,
On her sweet Niece , you never can take off
With all your Purges , or your Plaster of Oaths ;
Though you distil your Damm , drop by drop ,
I ' your defence .
That she hath had a Child ,
Here she doth spit upon thee , and defie thee ;
Or I do 't for her .
Madam , pray you bind her
To her behaviour .
Tie your Gossip up ,
Or send her unto Bet 'lem .
Go thou thither ,
That better hast deserv 'd it , shame of Doctors :
Where could she be deliver 'd ?
by what charm ,
Restor 'd to her strength so soon ?
who is the Father ?
Or where the Infant ?
Ask your Oracle ,
That walks , and talks in his sleep.
Where is he gone ?
You ha' lost a Fortune list 'ning to her , to her Tabour .
Good Madam lock her up .
You must give losers
Their leave to speak , good Doctor .
Follow his footing
Before he get to his Bed : This rest is lost else .
WHere is my Wife ?
what ha' you done with
my Wife ,
Gossip o ' the Counsels ?
I , sweet Mr. Compass ,
I honour you , and your Wife .
Well , do so still .
I will not call you Mother tho' , but Polish .
Good Gossip Polish , where ha' you hid my Wife ?
I hide your Wife ?
Or she 's run away .
That would make all suspected , Sir , a-fresh .
Come we will find her , if she be i' the House .
Why should I hide your Wife , good Mr. Compass ?
I know no cause , but that you are goody Polish ,
That 's good at malice ; good at mischief ; all
That can perplex or trouble a business throughly .
You may say what you will : yo ' are Mr. Compass ,
And carry a large sweep , Sir , i' your Circle .
I 'll sweep all corners , Gossip , to spring this .
If 't be above Ground .
I will have her cry 'd ,
By the Common-cryer , through all the Ward ,
But I will find her .
TIS such a Fly , this Gossip , with her buz ,
She blows on every thing , in every place !
A busie Woman is a fearful grievance !
Will he not sleep again ?
Yes , instantly ,
As soon as he is warm .
It is the nature
Of the Disease , and all these cold dry fumes ,
That are melancholick , to work at first ,
Slow , and insensibly in their ascent ,
Till being got up , and then distilling down
Upo ' the Brain ; they have a pricking quality
That breeds this restless rest , which we , the Sons
Of Physick , call a walking in the sleep ,
And telling mysteries , that must be heard
Softly , with art , as we were sewing Pillows
Under the Patients Elbows , else they 'd fly
Into a phrensie , run into the Woods ,
Where there are noises , huntings , shoutings , hallowings ,
Amidst the Brakes , and Furzes , over Bridges ,
Fall into Waters , scratch their Flesh , sometimes
Drop down a Pr?cipice , and there be lost .
How now ! what does her ?
He is up again ,
And 'gins to talk .
O' the former matter , Item ?
The Treasure , and the Lady : That 's his argument .
O me , happy Man ! he cannot off it .
I shall know all then .
With what appetite
Our own desires delude us ! Hear you Tim ?
Let no Man interrupt us .
Sir Diaphanous ,
And Mr. Bias , his Court-friend 's , desire
To kiss his Nieces Hands , and gratulate
The firm recovery of her good fame ,
And honour ?
Good , say to 'em , Mr. Item ,
My Niece is , on my Ladies side : they 'll find her there .
I pray to be but spar 'd , for half an hour :
I 'll see 'em presently .
Do , put 'em off , Tim .
And tell 'em the importance of the business .
Here , he is come ! sooth ; and have all out of him .
How do you Lady-bird ?
so hard at work , still ?
What 's that you say ?
do you bid me walk , sweet Bird ?
And tell our Knight ?
I will .
How ?
walk Knave , walk ?
I think y ' are angry with me , Pol .
Fine Pol !
Pol 's a fine Bird ! O fine , Lady Pol !
Almond for Parrat ; Parrat 's a brave Bird :
Three hundred thousand Pieces ha' you stuck
Edg-long into the Ground , within the Garden ?
O' bounteous Bird ! Int .
And me , most happy creature .
Smother your joy .
How ?
and dropp 'd twice so
many ? ?
Ha ! where ?
Contain your self .
I ' the old Well ?
I cannot , I am a Man of Flesh , and Blood :
Who can contain himself , to hear the Ghost
Of a dead Lady , do such works as these ?
And a City Lady too , o ' the strait Waste ?
He 's gone .
I will go try the truth of it .
Follow him , Tim : see what he does ; if he bring you
A 'ssay of it now .
I 'll say he 's a rare Fellow :
And has a rare Disease .
And I will work
As rare a cure upon him .
How , good Doctor ?
When he hath utter 'd all , that you would know of him ;
I 'll cleanse him with a Pill ( as small as a Pease )
And stop his Mouth : for there his Issue lies ,
Between the Muscles o ' the Tongue .
He 's come .
What did he , Item ?
The first step he stept
Into the Garden , he pull 'd these five Pieces
Up , in a Fingers breadth one of another .
The Dirt sticks on 'em still .
I know enough .
Doctor , proceed with your cure , I 'll make thee famous ,
Famous among the Sons of the Physicians ,
Machaon , Podalirius , Esculapius .
Thou shalt have a golden Beard , as well as he had ;
And thy Tim Item here , have one of Silver :
A livery Beard .
And all thy ' Pothecaries
Belong to thee .
Where 's Squire Needle ?
gone ?
He 's prick 'd away , now he has done the work .
Prepare his Pill , and gi' it him afore Supper .
I 'll send for a dozen o ' Labourers to morrow ,
To turn the surface o ' the Garden up .
In Mold ?
bruise every Clod ?
And have all sifted ;
For I 'll not lose a piece o ' the Birds bounty ,
And take an Inventory of all .
And then ,
I would go down into the Well ?
My self ;
No trusting other hands : Six hundred thousand ,
To the first three ; nine hundred thousand Pound .
' Twill purchase the whole Bench of Aldermanity ,
Stript to their Shirts .
There never did accrew
So great a gift to man , and from a Lady ,
I never saw but once ; now I remember ,
We met at Merchant-Taylors-hall , at dinner ,
In Thread-Needle-street .
Which was a sign Squire Needle
Should have the threading of this Thread .
' Tis true ;
I shall love Parrots better , while I know him .
I 'd have her Statue cut , now in white Marble .
And have it painted in most Orient Colours .
That 's right ! all City Statues must be painted ,
Else they be worth nought i' their subtile Judgments .
MY truest friend in Court , dear Mr. Bias ;
You hear o ' the recovery of our Niece
In fame and credit ?
Yes , I have been with her ,
And gratulated to her ; but I am sorry
T t t To
506 The Magnetick Lady .
To find the Author o ' the foul aspersion
Here i' your company , this insolent Doctor .
You do mistake him : he is clear got off on't .
A Gossips Jealousie first gave the hint .
He drives another way , now , as I would have him .
He 's a rare Man , the Doctor , in his way .
H' has done the noblest cure here , i' the House ,
On a poor Squire , my Sisters Taylor , Needle
That talk 'd in 's sleep; would walk to St .
John 's Wood ,
And Waltham Forrest , scape by all the Ponds ,
And Pits i' the way ; run over two-inch Bridges ;
With his Eyes fast , and i' the dead of night !
I 'll ha' you better acquainted with him .
Doctor ,
Here is my dear , dear , dearest friend in Court ,
Wise , powerful Mr. Bias ; pray you salute
Fach other , not as strangers , but true friends .
This is the Gentleman you brought to day ,
A Suitor to your Niece ?
You were
Agred , I heard ; the Writings drawn between you ?
And seal 'd .
What broke you off ?
This rumour of her ?
Was it not Mr. Bias ?
Which I find
Now false , and therefore come to make amends
I ' the first place .
I stand to the old conditions .
Faith give 'em him , Sir Moath , what e 'er they were .
You have a brave occasion now , to cross
The flanting Mr. Compass , who pretends
Right to the Portion , by th ' other Intail .
And claims it .
You do hear he 's married ?
We hear his Wife is run away from him ,
Within : She is not to be found i' the House ,
With all the Hue and Cry is made for her ,
Through every Room ; the Larders ha' been search 'd ,
The Bake-houses , and Boulting-tub , the Ovens ,
Wash-house , and Brew-house , nay the very Fornace ,
And yet she is not heard of .
Be she ne 'er heard of ,
The safety of Great Britain lies not on't .
You are content with the ten thousand Pound ,
Defalking the four hundred Garnish-money ?
That 's the condition here , afore the Doctor ,
And your demand , friend Bias .
It is Sir Moath .
Here comes the Parson then , shall make all sure .
Go you with my friend Bias , Parson Palate ,
Unto my Niece ; assure them we are agreed .
And Mrs. Compass too , is found within .
Where was she hid ?
In an old Bottle-house ,
Where they scrap 'd Trenchers ; there her Mother had
thrust her .
You shall have time , Sir , to triumph on him ,
When this fine feat is done , and his Rud-Ironside .
WAs ever any Gentlewoman us 'd
So barbarously by a malicious Gossip ,
Pretending to be Mother to her too ?
Pretending ! Sir , I am her Mother , and challenge
A right , and power for what I have done .
Out , Hag ;
Thou that hast put all nature off , and Woman ,
For sordid gain , betray 'd the trust committed
Unto thee by the dead , as from the living :
Chang 'd the poor innocent Infants in their Cradles :
Defrauded them o ' their Parents , chang 'd their names ,
Calling Placentia , Pleasance ; Pleasance , Placentia .
How knows he this ?
Abus 'd the Neighbour-hood ;
But most this Lady .
Did 'st enforce an Oath ,
To this poor Woman , on a pious Book ,
To keep close thy Impiety .
Ha' you told this ?
I told it ?
no , he knows it , and much more ,
As he 's a cunning Man .
A cunning Fool ,
If that be all .
But now to your true Daughter ,
That had the Child , and is the proper Pleasance ,
We must have an account of that too , Gossip .
This 's like all the rest of Mr. Compass .
HElp , help for Charity ; Sir Moath Interest
Is fall 'n into the Well .
Where ?
where ?
I ' the Garden .
A Rope to save his life .
How came he there ?
He thought to take possession of a Fortune ,
There newly drop't him , and the old Chain broke ,
And down fell he i' the Bucket .
Is it deep ?
We cannot tell .
A Rope : help with a Rope .
Enter Silk-worm , Ironside , Item , Needle ,
and Interest , Rut .
He is got out again .
The Knight is sav 'd .
A little sows 'd i' the Water : Needle sav 'd him .
The Water sav 'd him , 'twas a fair escape .
Ha' you no hurt ?
A little wet .
That 's nothing .
I wish 'd you stay , Sir , till to morrow : And told you ,
It was no lucky hour : since six a Clock
All Stars were retrograde .
I ' the name
Of fate , or folly , how came you i' the Bucket ?
That is a Quere of another time , Sister ,
The Doctor will resolve you ?
who hath done
The admirablest cure upon your Needle !
Gi' me thy Hand good Needle : thou cam 'st timely :
Take off my Hood and Coat ; And let me shake
My self a little .
I have a world of business .
Where is my Nephew Bias ?
and his Wife ?
Who bids God gi' em joy ?
Here they both stand
As sure affianced , as the Parson , or words
Can tie 'em .
We all wish 'em joy , and happiness .
I saw the Contract , and can witness it .
He shall receive ten thousand Pounds to morrow .
You look 'd for't , Compass , or a greater summ ,
But 'tis dispos 'd of , this , another way .
I have but one Niece , verily Compass .
I 'll find another .
Varlet , do your office .
I do arrest your Body , Sir Moath Interest ,
In the King 's name : at suit of Mr. Compass ,
And Dame Placentia his Wife .
And to resound the affront ?
I cannot stop
The Laws , or hinder Justice .
I can be
Your Bail , if't may be taken .
With the Captains ,
I ask no better .
Here are better Men ,
Will give their Bail .
But yours will not be taken ,
Worshipful Doctor ; you are good security
For a suit of Clothes , to th ' Taylor , that dares trust you :
You must to Prison , Sir ,
Unless you can find Bail the Creditor likes .
I would fain find it , if you 'd shew me where .
Faith I will bail him , at mine own apperil .
Varlet , be gone : I 'll once ha' the reputation ,
To be security for such a summ .
Bear up , Sir Moath .
He is not worth the Buckles
About his Belt , and yet this Ironside clashes .
Peace , lest he hear you Doctor ; we 'll make use
of him .
What doth your Brother Compass , Captain Ironside ,
Demand of us , by way of challenge , thus ?
Your
The Magnetick Lady .
507
Your Nieces Portion ; in the right of his Wife .
I have assur 'd one Portion , to one Niece ,
And have no more t ' account for , that I know of :
What I may do in charity ?
if my Sister
Will bid an off'ring for her Maid , and him ,
As a Benevolence to 'em , after Supper ,
I 'll spit into the Bason , and intreat
My Friends to do the like .
Spit out thy Gall ,
And Heart , thou Viper : I will now no mercy ,
No pitty of thee , thy false Niece , and Needle ;
Bring forth your Child , or I appeal you of murder ,
You , and this Gossip here , and Mother Chair .
The Gentleman 's fall 'n mad !
No, Mrs. Midwife .
I saw the Child , and you did give it me ,
And put it i' my Arms , by this ill token ,
You wish 'd me such another ; and it cry 'd .
The Law is plain ; if it were heard to cry ,
And you produce it not , he may Indict
All that conceal 't , of Felony , and Murder .
And I will take the boldness , Sir , to do it :
Beginning with Sir Moath here , and his Doctor .
Good faith this same is like to turn a business .
Pal , And a shrew 'd business , marry : they all start at't .
I ha' the right Thread now , and I will keep it .
You , goody Keep , confess the truth to my Lady ,
The truth , the whole truth , nothing but the truth .
I scorn to be prevented of my glories .
I plotted the deceit , and I will own it .
Love to my Child , and lucre of the Portion
Provok 'd me ; wherein though th ' event hath fail 'd
In part , I will make use of the best side .
This is my Daughter , and she hath had a Child
This day , unto her shame , ( I now profess it . )
By this meer false-stick , Squire Needle , but
Since this wise Knight hath thought it good to change
The foolish Father of it , by assuring
Her to his dear friend , Mr. Bias ; and him
Again to her , by clapping of him on
With his free promise of ten thousand Pound ,
Afore so many witnesses .
Whereof I
Am one .
And I another .
I should be unnatural
To my own Flesh , and Blood , would I not thank him .
I thank you , Sir : and I have reason for it .
For here your true Niece stands , fine Mrs. Compass .
( I 'll tell you truth , you have deserv 'd it from me . )
To whom you are by Bond engag 'd to pay
The sixteen thousand Pound , which is her Portion ,
Due to her Husband , on her Marriage-day .
I speak the truth , and nothing but the truth .
You 'll pay it now , Sir Moath , with Interest ?
You see the truth breaks out on every side of you .
Into what Nets of cous'nage am I cast
On ev'ry side ?
each Thread is grown a Noof :
A very Mesh : I have run my self into
A double break , of paying twice the Money .
You shall be releas 'd , of paying me a Penny ,
With these conditions .
Will you leave her then ?
Yes , and the summ , twice told , e 'er take a Wife ,
To pick out Monsieur Needle 's Basting-threads .
Gossip you are paid : though he be a fit nature ,
Worthy to have a Whore justly put on him ;
He is not bad enough to take your Daughter ,
On such a cheat .
Will you yet pay the Portion ?
What will you bate ?
No Penny the Law gives .
Yes , Bias 's Money .
What , your friend in Court ?
I will not rob you of him , nor the purchase ,
Nor your dear Doctor here , stand altogether .
Birds of a nature all , and of a feather .
Well , we are all now reconcil 'd to truth .
There rests yet a gratuity from me ,
To be conferr 'd upon this Gentleman ;
Who ( as my Nephew Compass says ) was cause
First of th ' offence , but since of all th ' amends ,
The quarrel caus 'd th ' affright ; that fright brought on
The travel , which made peace ; the peace drew on
This new discovery , which endeth all
In reconcilement .
When the Portion
Is tender 'd , and receiv 'd .
Well , you must have it ,
As good at first as last .
' Tis well said Brother .
And I , if this good Captain will accept me ,
Give him my self , endow him with my Estate ,
And make him Lord of me , and all my Fortunes :
He that hath sav 'd my hour , though by chance ,
I 'll really study his , and how to thank him .
And I imbrace you , Lady , and your goodness ,
And vow to quit all thought of War hereafter ;
Save what is fought under your Colours , Madam .
More work then for the Parson ; I shall cap
The Loadstone with an Ironside , I see .
And take in these , the forlorn Couple , with us ,
Needle , and 's Thread , whose Portion I will think on ;
As being a business , waiting on my bounty :
Thus I do take possession of you , Madam ,
My true Magnetick Mistris , and my Lady .
