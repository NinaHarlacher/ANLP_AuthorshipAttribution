such luck to spin out these fine things still ,
and like a Silk-worm , out of my self .
Here 's
Master Bartholomew Cokes , of Harrow o ' th '
Hill , i' th ' County of Middlesex , Esquire ,
takes forth his Licence to marry Mistress Grace Well-born ,
of the said Place and County : And when do 's he take
it forth ?
to day ! the Four and Twentieth of August !
Bartholmew-day ! Bartholmew upon Bartholmew ! there 's
the Device ! who would have mark 'd such a Leap-Frog
Chance now ?
A very less than Ames-ace , on two Dice !
Well , go thy ways , John Little-wit , Proctor John Little -
wit : One o ' the pretty Wits o ' Pauls , the Little-wit of
London ( so thou art call 'd ) and something beside .
When
a Quirk or a Quiblin do 's scape thee , and thou dost not
watch and apprehend it , and bring it afore the Con-
stable of Conceit : ( there now , I speak Quib too ) let
'em carry thee out o ' the Arch-deacons Court into his
Kitchin , and make a Jack of thee , instead of a John .
( There I am again la ! ) Win , Good Morrow , Win .
Imarry , Win ! Now you look finely indeed , Win ! this
Cap do 's convince ! you 'ld not ha' worn it , Win , nor ha'
had it Velvet , but a rough Countrey Bever , with a
Copper Band , like the Conney-skin-woman of Budge -
Row ?
Sweet Win , let me kiss it ! And her fine high
Shooes , like the Spanish Lady ! Good Win , go a little , I
would fain see thee pace , pretty Win ! By this fine Cap ,
I could never leave kissing on't .
Come indeed la , you are such a Fool still !
No, but half a one , Win , you are the t 'other
half : Man and Wife make one Fool , Win .
( Good ! )
Is there the Poctor , or Doctor indeed , i' the Diocess ,
that ever had the Fortune to win him such a Win !
( There I am again ! ) I do feel Conceits coming upon
me , more than I am able to turn Tongue too .
A Pox
o ' these Pretenders to Wit ! Your Three Cranes , Miter
and Mermaid men ! Not a Corn of true Salt , not a
Grain of right Mustard amongst them all .
They may
stand for Places , or so , again the next Wit fall , and
pay Two Pence in a Quart more for their Canary
than other Men .
But gi' me the Man can start up a
Justice of Wit out of Six Shillings Beer , and give the
Law to all the Poets and Poet-Suckers i' Town , because
they are the Players Gossips .
' Slid , other Men have
Wives as fine as the Players , and as well drest .
Come
hither , Win .
Lips ?
or molding of Kisses ?
which is it ?
Troth , I am a little taken with my Wins dres -
sing here ! Dost not fine , Master Win-wife ?
How do
you apprehend , Sir ?
She would not ha' worn this Ha -
I challenge all Cheapside to shew such another :
More-fields , Pimlico-path , or the Exchange , in a Summer-
Evening , with a Lace to boot , as this has .
Dear Win ,
let Master Win-wife kiss you .
He comes a wooing to our
Mother , Win , and may be our Father perhaps , Win .
There 's
no harm in him , Win .
None i' the Earth , Master Little-wit .
I envy no Man my Delicates , Sir .
Alas , you ha' the Garden where they grow
still ! A Wife here with a Strawberry-Breath , Cherry-
Lips , Apricot-Cheeks , and a soft Velvet Head , like a
Good , i'faith ! now dulness upon me , that I had
not that before him , that I should not light on't as well
as he ! Velvet Head !
But my taste , Master Little-wit , tend to
Fruit of a latter kind : the Sober Matron , your Wives
I ! we know you are a Suitor , Sir ; Win , and I
both , wish you well : By this Licence here would you
had her , that your Two Names were as fast in it as here
are a Couple .
Win would fain have a fine Young
Father i' Law , with a Feather : that her Mother
might Hood it , and Chain it , with Mistris Over-
But you do not take the right course , Master
No ?
Master Little-wit , why ?
You are not mad enough .
How ?
Is Madness a right course ?
I say nothing , but I wink upon Win .
You have
a Friend , one ( Master Quarlous ) comes here some-
Why ?
he makes no Love to her , do 's he ?
Not a Tokenworth that ever I saw , I assure you :
But ? ?
What ?
He is the more Mad-cap o ' the Two .
You do
not apprehend me .
You have a hot Coal i' your Mouth now , you
cannot hold .
Let me out with it , dear Win .
I 'll tell him my self .
Do , and take all the Thanks , and much do good
thy pretty heart , Win .
Sir , my Mother has had her Nativity-water
cast lately by the Cunning-Men in Cow-lane , and they
ha' told her her Fortune , and do ensure her , she shall
never have happy hour , unless she marry within this
Sen'night ; and when it is , it must be a Mad Man ,
they say .
I , but it must be a Gentleman-Mad Man .
Yes , so the t ' other man of More-fields says .
But do 's she believe 'em ?
Yes , and has been at Bedlam twice since evety
day , to enquire if any Gentleman be there , or to come
there mad !
Why , this is a Confederacy , a meer piece of
practice upon her by these Impostors .
I tell her so ; or else , say I , that they mean some
Young Madcap-Gentleman ( for the Devil can equivo -
cate as well as a Shop-keeper ) and therefore would I ad-
vise you to be a little madder than Master Quarlous here -
Where is she ?
stirring yet ?
Stirring ! Yes , and studying an Old Elder come
from Banbury , a Suitor that puts in here at Meal-tide , to
praise the painful Brethren , or pray that the Sweet
Singers may be restor 'd ; Says a Grace as long as his
Breath lasts him ! Some time the Spirit is so strong with
him , it gets quite out of him , and then my Mother , or
Win , are fain to fetch it again with Malmsey , or Aqua
Yes indeed , we have such a tedious Life
with him for his Dyet , and his Clothes too , he
breaks his Buttons , and cracks Seams at every Saying
he sobs out .
He cannot abide my Vocation , he says .
No, he told my Mother , a Proctor was a
Claw of the Beast , and that she had little less |than
committed Abomination in marrying me so as she ha 's
Every Line ( he says ) that a Proctor writes ,
when it comes to be read in the Bishop 's Court ,
is a long black Hair , kemb 'd out of the Tail of An-
When came this Proselyte ?
Some three days since .
it 's well a Man may
reach you after three hours running yet ! what an
unmerciful Companion art thou , to quit thy Lodging
at such ungentlemanly hours ?
None but a scatter 'd
Covey of Fidlers , or one of these Rag-rakers in Dung-
hills , or some Marrow-bone-man at most , would have
been up when thou wert gone abroad , by all Descri-
I pray thee what ailest thou , thou canst not
sleep ?
hast thou Thorns i' thy Eye-lids , or Thistles
i' thy Bed ?
I cannot tell : It seems you had neither i' your
Feet , that took this pain to find me .
No, and I had , all the Lime-hounds o ' the Ci-
ty should have drawn after you by the Scent rather .
Mr. John Little-wit ! God save you , Sir . ' Twas a
hot Night with some of us , last Night , John : shall
we pluck a Hair o ' the same Wolf to day , Proctor
John ?
Do you remember , Master Quarlous , what we
discours 'd on last night ?
Not I , John : nothing that I either discourse or
do , at those times I forfeit all to forgetfulness .
No ?
not concerning Win , look you : there she
is , and drest , as I told you she should be : Hark you , Sir ,
had you forgot ?
By this Head , I 'll beware how I keep you
company , John , when I am drunk , and you have this
dangerous memory ! that 's certain .
Why Sir ?
Why ?
we were all a little stain 'd last Night ,
sprinkled with a Cup or two , and I agreed with Pro-
ctor John here , to come and do somewhat with Win
( I know not what 'twas ) to day ; and he puts me in
mind on't now ; he says he was coming to fetch me :
Before Truth , if you have that fearful Quality , John ,
to remember when you are sober , John , what you pro-
mise drunk , John ; I shall take heed of you , John .
For
this once I am content to wink at you ; where 's your
Wife ?
Come hither , Win .
Why , John ! do you see this , John ?
look you !
help me , John .
O Win , fie , what do you mean , Win ?
Be wo -
manly Win ; make an Out-cry to your Mother , Win ?
Master Quarlous is an honest Gentleman , and our wor-
shipful good Friend , Win : and he is Master VVin-wifes
Friend too : And Master VVinwife comes a Suitor to
your Mother , VVin ; as I told you before , VVin , and
may perhaps be our Father , VVin : they 'l do you no
harm , VVin , they are both our Worshipful good
Master Quarlous ! you must know Master
Quarlous , VVin ; you must not quarrel with Master
Quarlous , VVin .
No, we 'll kiss again , and fall in .
Yes , do , good VVin .
I ' faith you are a Fool , John .
A Fool-John , she calls me ; do you mark
that , Gentlemen ?
Pretty Little-wit of Velvet ! a Fool-
She may call you an Apple-John , if you use
Pray thee forbear , for my Respect , some-
Hoy-day ! how respective you are become
o ' the sudden ! I fear this Family will turn you reform -
ed too ; pray you come about again .
Because she is in
possibility to be your Daughter-in-Law , and may ask
you Blessing hereafter , when she courts it to Totnam
to eat Cream .
Well , I will forbear , Sir ; but i' faith ,
would thou would 'st leave thy Exercise of Widow-
hunting once ! this drawing after an Old Reverend
Smock by the Splay-Foot : There cannot be an anci-
ent Tripe or Trillibub i' the Town , but thou art straight
nosing it , and 'tis a fine Occupation thou'lt confine thy
self to , when thou hast got one ; scrubbing a piece of
Buff , as if thou hadst the perpetuity of Pannyer-Alley
to stink in ; or perhaps worse , currying a Carkass that
thou hast bound thy self to alive .
I 'll be sworn , some
of them ( that thou art , or hast been a Suitor to ) are
so old , as no chaste or married pleasure can ever be-
come 'em : the honest Instrument of Procreation has
( Forty Years since ) left to belong to 'em ; thou must
visit 'em as thou wouldst do a Tomb , with a Torch , or
Three Handfuls of Link , flaming hot , and so thou
maist hap to make 'em feel thee , and after , come to in-
herit according to thy Inches .
A sweet course for a
man to waste the Brand of Life for , to be still raking
himself a Fortune in an Old Womans Embers ; we
shall ha' thee , after thou hast been but a Month marri-
ed to one of 'em , look like the Quartane Ague and the
Black Jaundise met in a Face , and walk as if thou hadst
borrow 'd Legs of a Spinner , and Voice of a Cricket .
Iwould endure to hear Fifteen Sermons a week for her ,
and such course , and loud ones , as some of 'em must
be ; I would e 'en desire of Fate , I might dwell in a
Drum , and take in my Sustenance with an old broken
Tabacco-pipe and a Straw .
Dost thou ever think to
bring thine Ears or Stomach to the patience of a dry
Grace , as long as thy Table-Cloath ?
and droan 'd out
by thy Son here ( that might be thy Father ) , till all the
meat o ' thy Board has forgot it was that day i' the
Kitchin ?
Or to brook the noise made in a Question of
Pr?destination , by the good Labourers and painful Eat-
ers assembled together , put to 'em by the Matron your
Spouse ; who moderates with a Cup of Wine , ever and
anon , and a Sentence out of Knoxe between ?
Or the
perpetual spitting before and after a sober drawn Exhor-
ation of Six Hours , whose better part was the Hum-ha -
hum ?
Or to hear Prayers groan 'd out over thy Iron
Chests , as if they were Charms to break 'em ?
And all
this for the hope of Two Apostle-Spoons , to suffer ! and a
Cup to eat a Cawdle in ! For that will be thy Legacy .
She 'll ha' convey 'd her State safe enough from thee , an'
she be a right Widow .
Alas , I am quite off that Scent now .
How so ?
Put off by a Brother of Banbury , one that ,
they say , is come here , and governs all already .
What do you call him ?
I knew divers of those
Banburians when I was in Oxford .
Master Little-wit can tell us .
Sir ! good VVin , go in , and if Master Barthol-
mew Cokes his Man come for the Licence ( the little Old
Fellow ) let him speak with me ; what say you , Gen-
tlemen ?
What call you the Reverend Elder you told
me of ?
your Banbury-man ?
Rabbi Busy , Sir , he is more than an Elder , he is a
Prophet , Sir .
O , I know him ! a Baker , is he not ?
He was a Baker , Sir , but he do 's dream now , and
see Visions , he has given over his Trade .
I remember that too : out of a Scruple he took ,
that ( in spic 'd Conscience ) those Cakes he made , were
serv 'd to Bridales , May-Poles , Morrisses , and such pro-
phane Feasts and Meetings ; his Christen-Name is Zeal-
Yes , Sir , Zeal-of-the-land Busy .
How ! what a Name 's there !
O , they have all such Names , Sir ; he was Wit-
ness for VVin here , ( they will not be call 'd God-fathers )
and nam 'd her VVin-the-fight , you thought her Name had
been VVinnifred , did you not ?
I did indeed .
He would ha' thought himself a stark Reprobate ,
if it had .
I , for there was a Blew-starch-woman o ' the
Name , at the same time .
A notable hypocritical Ver-
mine it is ; I know him .
One that stands upon his
Face , more than his Faith , at all times ; Ever in sedi-
tious motion , and reproving for Vain-glory : of a most
Lunatick Conscience and Spleen , and affects the Vio-
lence of Singularity in all he do 's : ( He has undone a
Grocer here , in Newgate-Market , that broke with him ,
trusted him with Currans , as errant a Zeal as he , that 's
by the way : ) By his Profession , he will ever be i' the
State of Innocence , though ; and Childhood ; de-
rides all Antiquity , defies any other Learning than
Inspiration ; and what Discretion soever Years should
afford him , it is all prevented in his Original Ignorance ;
ha' not to do with him : for he is a Fellow of a
most arrogant and invincible dullness , I assure you ;
who is this ?
you : and God give you good morrow ; Master
Little-wit , my business is to you .
Is this License
ready ?
Here I ha' it for you in my hand , Master Hum -
That 's well ; nay , never open or read it to me ,
it 's labour in vain , you know .
I am no Clerk , I scorn
to be sav 'd by my Book , i'faith I 'll hang first ; fold it
up o ' your word , and gi' it me ; what must you ha'
for't ?
We 'll talk of that anon , Master Humphrey .
Now or not at all , good Mr. Proctor , I am for no
anon 's , I assure you .
Sweet Win , bid Solomon send me the little black
Box within in my Study .
I , quickly , good Mistris , I pray you : for I have
both Eggs o ' the Spit , and Iron i' the Fire , say what you
must have , good Mr. Little-wit .
Why , you know the price , Mr. Numps .
I know ?
I know nothing .
I , what tell you
me of knowing ?
( now I am in haste ) Sir , I do not
know , and I will not know , and I scorn to know , and
yet , ( now I think on't ) I will , and do know as well as
another ; you must have a Mark for your thing here ,
and Eight Pence for the Box ; I could ha' sav 'd Two Pence
i' that , an' I had bought it my self , but here 's Fourteen
Shillings for you .
Good Lord ! how long your little wife
stays ! pray God Solomon , your Clerk , be not looking
i' the wrong Box , Mr. Proctor .
Good i' faith ! no , I warrant you , Solomon is wi -
ser than so , Sir .
Fie , fie , fie , by your leave , Master Little-wit , this
is scurvy , idle , foolish and abominable , with all my heart ;
I do not like it .
Do you hear ?
Jack Little-wit , what business
does thy pretty head think this Fellow may have , that he
keeps such a coyl with ?
More than buying of Ginger-bread i' the Cloy-
ster , here , ( for that we allow him ) or a guilt pouch i' the
Fair ?
Master Quarlous , do not mistake him : he is his
Master 's Both-hands , I assure you .
What ?
to pull on his Boots a Mornings , or his
Stockings , do 's he ?
Sir , if you have a mind to mock him , mock him
softly , and look t 'other way : for if he apprehend you
flout him once , he will fly at you presently .
A terrible
testy old Fellow , and his Name is Waspe too .
Pretty Insect ! make much on him .
A Plague o ' this Box , and the Pox too , and on
him that made it , and her that went for't , and all that
should ha' sought it , sent it , or brought it ! do you see ,
Sir ?
Nay , good Mr. Waspe .
Good Master Hornet , turd i' your teeth , hold
you your tongue : do not I know you ?
Your Father was
a Pothecary , and sold Glisters , more than he gave , I wusse :
and turd i' your little Wives teeth too ( here she comes ) ,
'twill make her spit as fine as she is , for all her Velvet
Custard on her head , Sir .
O ! be civil , Master Numps .
Why , say I have a Humour not to be civil ; how
then ?
who shall compel me ?
you ?
Here is the Box now .
Why a Pox o ' your Box , once again : let your
little Wife stale in it , and she will .
Sir , I would have
you to understand , and these Gentlemen too , if they
please ? ?
With all our Hearts , Sir .
That I have a charge , Gentlemen .
They do apprehend , Sir .
Pardon me , Sir , neither they nor you can ap -
prehend me yet .
( You are an Ass ) I have a Young Ma -
ster , he is now upon his making and marring ; the whole
care of his well-doing , is now mine .
His foolish School -
masters have done nothing , but run up and down the
Countrey with him to beg Puddings , and Cake-bread of
his Tenants , and almost spoiled him ; he has learn 'd
nothing but to sing Catches , and repeat Rattle Bladder ,
rattle , and O , Madge .
I dare not let him walk alone ,
for fear of learning of vile Tunes , which he will sing at
Supper , and in the Sermon-times ! If he meet but a
Carman i' the Street , and I find him not talk to keep
him off on him , he will whistle him , and all his Tunes
over at Night in his Sleep ! he has a head full of Bees !
I am fain now ( for this little time I am absent ) to leave
him in charge with a Gentlewoman : : ' Tis true , she is
a Justice of Peace his Wife , and a Gentlewoman o ' the
Hood , and his Natural Sister : But what may happen
under a Womans Government , there 's the doubt .
Gen-
tlemen , you do not know him : he is another manner of
piece than you think for ! but Nineteen years old , and
yet he is taller than either of you by the Head , God
bless him .
Well , methinks this is a fine Fellow !
He has made his Master a finer by this Descrip -
tion , I should think .
' Faith , much about one , it 's Cross and Pile ,
whether for a New Farthing .
I 'll tell you , Gentlemen ? ?
Will 't please you drink , Master VVaspe ?
Why , I ha' not talk't so long to be dry , Sir ;
you see no Dust or Cobwebs come out o ' my Mouth :
do you ?
you 'ld ha' me gone , would you ?
No, but you were in haste e 'en now , Mr.
What an' I were ?
so I am still , and yet I will
stay too ; meddle you with your match , your Win , there ,
she has as little Wit as her Husband , it seems : I have o -
thers to talk to .
She 's my match indeed , and as little Wit as I ,
Good !
We ha' been but a day and a half in Town ,
Gentlemen , 'tis true , and yesterday i' the Afternoon
we walk 'd London , to shew the City to the Gentlewo -
man he shall marry , Mistris Grace ; but afore I will en-
dure such another half day with him , I 'll be drawn with
a good Gib-cat , through the great Pond at home , as his
Uncle Hodge was ! why , we could not meet that Heathen
thing all day , but staid him : he would name you all the
Signs over , as he went , aloud : and where he spi 'd a
Parrat , or a Monkey , there he was pitch 'd , with all the
little Long-Coats about him , Male and Female ; no get-
ting him away ! I thought he would ha' run mad o ' the
black boy in Bucklers-bury , that takes the scurvy , roguy
Tabacco there .
You say true , Master Numps : there 's such a one
It 's no matter whether there be or no , what 's
that to you ?
He will not allow of John 's reading at any
ONumps ! are you here , Numps ?
look where I am .
Numps ! and Mistris Grace too ! nay , do not look
angerly , Numps , my Sister is here and all , I do not come
without her .
What the mischief do you come with her ?
or
she with you ?
We came all to seek you , Numps .
To seek me ?
why , did you all think I was lost ,
or run away with your Fourteen Shillings worth of small
Ware here ?
or that I had chang 'd it i' the Fair for Hob -
by-horses ?
S' precious ? ?
to seek me !
Nay , good Mr. Numps do you shew discretion ,
tho he be exorbitant , ( as Mr. Over-do says ) and't be but
for conservation of the Peace .
Marry gip , Goodly She-Justice , Mistris French -
hood ! turd i' your teeth ; and turd i' your French-hoods
teeth too , to do you service , do you see ?
must you
quote your Adam to me ! you think you are Madam Re-
gent still , Mistris Over-do ; when I am in place ?
No
such matter , I assure you , your Raign is out , when I am
in , Dame .
I am content to be in abeyance , Sir , and be go -
ver n 'd by you ; so should he too , if he did well ; but
'till be expected you should also govern your Passions .
Will 't so , forsooth ?
good Lord ! how sharp you
are ! with being at Beth'lem yesterday ?
VVhetstone has set
an Edge upon you , has he ?
Nay , if you know not what belongs to your
Dignity , I do yet to mine .
Very well then .
Is this the Licence , Numps ?
for Loves sake let me
see 't ; I never saw a Licence .
Did you not so ?
why , you shall not see 't then .
An' you love me , good Numps .
Sir , I love you , and yet I do not love you i'these
Fooleries ; set your heart at rest ; there 's nothing in't but
hard words ; and what would you see 't for ?
I would see the length and the breadth on't , that 's
all ; and I will see 't now , so I will .
You sha' not see it here .
Then I 'll see 't at home , and I 'll look upon the
Case here .
Why , do so ; a man must give way to him a
little in Trifles : Gentlemen .
These are Errors , Diseases
of Youth : which he will mend when he comes to Judg-
ment and knowledge of matters .
I pray you conceive
so , and I thank you .
And I pray you pardon him , and
I thank you again .
Well , this Dry-Nurse , I say still , is a delicate man .
And I am , for the Cosset , his charge ! Did you
ever see a Fellows Face more accuse him for an Ass ?
Accuse him ?
it confesses him one without accu-
What pity 'tis yonder wench should marry such a
Cokes ?
' Tis true .
She seems to be discreet , and as sober as she is
I , and if you mark her , what a restrain 'd
scorn she casts upon all his behaviour and speeches ?
Well , Numps , I am now for another piece of bu-
siness more , the Fair , Numps , and then ?
Bless me ! deliver me , help , hold me ! the Fair !
Nay , never fidg up and down , Numps , and vex it
I am resolute Bartholmew in this ; I 'll make no suit
on't to you ; 'twas all the end of my Journey indeed , to
shew Mrs. Grace my Fair .
I call 't my Fair , because of
Bartholmew : you know my Name is Bartholmew , and
That was mine afore , Gentlemen : this morning .
I had that i'faith upon his Licence , believe me , there he
comes after me .
Come , John , this ambitious Wit of yours ( I am
afraid ) will do you no good i' the end .
No ?
why Sir ?
You grow so insolent with it , and over-doing ,
John ; that if you look not to it , and tie it up , it will
bring you to some obscure place in time , and there 'twill
leave you .
Do not trust it too much , John , be more spa-
ring , and use it but now and then ; a Wit is a dangerous
thing in this Age ; do not over-buy it .
Think you so , Gentlemen ?
I 'll take heed on't
Yes , do John .
A pretty little Soul , this same Mrs. Little-wit
would I might marry her .
So would I , or any body else , so I might scape you .
Numps , I will see it , Numps , 'tis decreed : never
be melancholly for the matter .
Why , see it , Sir , see it , do , see it ! who hinders
you ?
why do you not go see it ?
' Slid see it .
The Fair , Numps , the Fair .
Would the Fair , and all the Drums and Rattles
in't were i' your belly for me : they are already i' your
Brain : he that had the means to travel your head now ,
should meet finer sights than any are i' the Fair ; and
make a finer Voyage on't ; to see it all hung with Cockle -
shels , Pebbles , fine Wheat-straws , and here and there a
Chicken 's Feather , and a Cob-web.
Good faith , he looks , methinks , an' you mark
him , like one that were made to catch Flies , with his Sir
And his Numps , to flap 'em away .
God , be w'you , Sir , there 's your Bee in a Box ,
and much good do 't you .
Why , your Friend , and Bartholmew ; an' you be
so contumacious .
What mean you , Numps ?
I 'll not be guilty , I , Gentlemen .
You will not let him go , Brother , and lose
him ?
Who can hold that will away ?
I had rather
lose him than the Fair , I wusse .
You do not know the inconvenience , Gentle -
tlemen , you perswade to , nor what trouble I have with
him in these humours .
If he go to the Fair , he will buy
of every thing to a Baby there ; and Houshold-stuff for
that too .
If a Leg or an Arm on him did not grow
on , he would lose it i' the Press .
Pray Heaven I bring
him off with one Stone ! And then he is such a ravener
after Fruit ! you will not believe what a coil I had
t 'other day , to compound a business between a Katern -
pear-woman , and him , about snatching ! 'tis intolerable ,
O ! but you must not leave him now to these
hazards , Numps .
Nay , he knows too well , I will not leave him ,
and that makes him presume : well , Sir , will you go
now ?
if you have such an itch i' your feet , to foot it to
the Fair , why do you stop , am I your Tarriars ?
go ,
will you go ?
Sir , why do you not go ?
O Numps ! have I brought you about ?
come
Mistriss Grace , and Sister , I am resolute Bat , i' faith ,
Truly , I have no such fancy to the Fair ; nor
ambition to see it ; there 's none goes thither of any qua -
lity or fashion .
O Lord , Sir ! you shall pardon me , Mistriss Grace ,
we are enow of our selves to make it a fashion : and for
qualities , let Numps alone , he 'll find qualities .
What a Rogue in apprehension is this ! to un-
derstand her Language no better .
I , and offer to marry to her .
Well , I will leave
the chase of my Widow , for to day , and directly to the
These Flies cannot , this hot season , but engender
us excellent creeping sport .
A Man that has but a Spoon full of Brain
would think so .
Farewel , John .
Win , you see , 'tis in fashion , to go to the Fair ,
Win : we must to the Fair too , you and I , Win .
I have
an affair i' the Fair , Win , a Puppet-play of mine own
making : say nothing , that I writ for the motion Man ,
which you must see , Win .
I would I might John ; but my Mother will
never consent to such a prophane motion : she will
call it .
Tut , we 'll have a device , a dainty one : ( Now ,
Wit , help at a pinch , good Wit come , come good Wit , and
't be thy will . )
I have it , Win , I have it i' faith , and 'tis
a fine one .
Win , long to eat of a Pig , sweet Win , i' the
Fair ; do you see ?
i' the heart o ' the Fair ; not at Pye-
Your Mother will do any thing , Win , to satis -
fie your longing , you know ; pray thee long presently ,
and be sick o ' the sudden , good Win .
I 'll go in and tell
her ; cut thy Lace i' the mean time , and play the Hy-
pocrite , sweet Win .
No, I 'll not make me unready for it .
I can
be Hypocrite enough , though I were never so straight
You say true , you have bin bred i' the Family ,
and brought up to't .
Our Mother is a most elect Hypo-
crite , and has maintain 'd us all this seven year with it ,
like Gentle-folks .
I , Let her alone , John , she is not a wise wilful
Widow for nothing ; nor a sanctified Sister for a Song .
And let me alone too , I ha' somewhat o ' the Mother in
me , you shall see , fetch her , fetch her , ah , ah .
away this evil from our House ! how now Win-
the-fight , Child : how do you ?
Sweet Child , speak to me .
Yes , forsooth .
Look up , sweet Win-the-fight , and suffer not the
Enemy to enter you at this Door , remember that your
Education has bin with the purest ; what polluted one
was it , that nam 'd first the unclean Beast , Pig , to you ,
Child ?
( Uh , uh . )
Not I , o ' my sincerity Mother : she long 'd above
three hours e 'er she would let me know it ; who was it
Win ?
A prophane black thing with a Beard , John .
O ! resist it , Win-the-fight , it is the Tempter , the
wicked Tempter , you may know it by the fleshly mo-
tion of Pig , be strong against it , and it 's foul temptati-
ons , in these assaults , whereby it broacheth Flesh and
Blood , as it were on the weaker side , and pray against
it 's carnal provocations ; good Child , sweet Child , pray .
Good Mother , I pray you , that she may eat some
Pig , and her belly full too ; and do not you cast away
your own Child , and perhaps one of mine , with your
tale of the Tempter : how do you , Win ?
Are you not
sick ?
Yes , a great deal , John , (uh , uh . )
What shall we do ?
call our zealous Brother Bu-
sy hither , for his faithful fortification in this charge of
the adversary ; Child , my dear Child , you shall eat Pig ,
be comforted , my sweet Child .
I , but i' the Fair , Mother .
I mean i' the Fair , if it can be any way made
or found lawful ; where is our Brother Busy ?
Will he not
come ?
look up , Child .
Presently , Mother , as soon as he has cleans 'd
his Beard .
I found him fast by the Teeth , i' the cold
Turkey-pie i' the Cupboard , with a great white Loaf
on his left-hand , and a Glass of Malmsey on his right .
Slander not the Brethren , wicked one .
Here he is now , purified Mother .
O Brother Busy ! your help here to edifie and
raise us up in a scruple ; my Daughter Win-the-fight is
visited with a natural Disease of Women ; call 'd , A long-
ing to eat Pig .
I Sir , a Bartholmew-Pig : and in the Fair .
And I would be satisfied from you , Religiously-
wise , whether a Widow of the sanctified Assembly , or
a Widows Daughter , may commit the act without of -
fence to the weaker Sisters .
Verily , for the Disease of Longing , it is a Di-
sease , a carnal Disease , or Appetite , incident to Women :
and as it is carnal , and incident , it is natural , very natu-
ral : Now Pig , it is a Meat , and a Meat that is nourish -
ing , and may be long 'd for , and so consequently eaten ;
it may be eaten ; very exceeding well eaten : but in the
Fair , and as a Bartholmew-Pig , it cannot be eaten ; for
the very calling it a Bartholmew-Pig ; and to eat it so , is
a spice of Idolatry , and you make the Fair no better than
one of the high Places .
This I take it is the state of the
A high place .
I , but in state of necessity : Place should give
place , Mr. Busy , ( I have a conceit left yet . )
Good Brother , Zeal-of-the-land , think to make it
as lawful as you can .
Yes Sir , and as soon as you can : for it must be
Sir ; you see the danger my little Wife is in , Sir .
Truly , I do love my Child dearly , and I would
not have her miscarry , or hazard her first fruits , if it
might be otherwise .
F f f Bus .
Surely ,
Surely , it may be otherwise , but it is subject to
construction , subject , and hath a face of offence with
the weak , a great face , a foul face , but that face may
have a veil put over it , and be shaddowed as it were , it
may be eaten , and in the Fair , I take it , in a Booth , the
Tents of the wicked : the place is not much , not very
much , we may be Religious in midst of the prophane , so
it be eaten with a reformed Mouth , with sobriety , and
humbleness ; not gorg 'd in with gluttony , or greediness ;
there 's the fear : for , should she go there , as taking pride
in the place , or delight in the unclean dressing , to feed
the vanity of the Eye , or the lust of the Palate , it
were not well , it were not fit , it were abominable , and
not good .
Nay , I knew that afore , and told her on't ; but
courage , Win , we 'll be humble enough , we 'll seek out
the homeliest Booth i' the Fair ; that 's certain , rather
then fail , we 'll eat it o ' the Ground .
I , and I 'll go with you my self , Win-the-fight , and
my Brother Zeal of-the-land shall go with us too , for our
better consolation .
Uh , uh .
I , and Salomon too Win , ( the more the merrier )
Win , we 'll leave Rabby Busy in a Booth .
Salomon , my
Here , Sir .
In the way of comfort to the weak , I will go
and eat .
I will eat exceedingly , and prophesie ; there
may be a good use made of it too , now I think on't :
by the publick eating of Swines Flesh , to profess our
hate and loathing of Judaism , whereof the Brethren
stand taxed .
I will therefore eat , yea I will eat exceed -
Good i' faith , I will eat heartily too , because I
will be no Jew , I could never away with that stiffnecked
generation : and truly , I hope my little one will be like
me , that cries for Pig so i' the Mothers Belly .
Very likely , exceeding likely , very exceeding

There is a doing of right out of

Never shall I enough
commend a worthy worshipful Man , sometime a capi-

point , who would take you now the habit of a Porter ,
now of a Carman , now of the Dog-killer , in this month
of August ; and in the Winter , of a seller of Tinder-
boxes ; and what would he do in all these shapes ?

not trust his corrupt Officers , he would do 't himself .

to mistake an honest zealous Pursivant , for a Seminary :
and a a proper young Batchellor of Musick , for a Bawd .

Many are the
yearly enormities of this Fair , in whose Courts of Pye-
poulders I have had the honour , during the three days ,
sometimes to sit as Judge .
But this is the special day for
detection of those foresaid enormities .
Here is my
black Book for the purpose ; this the Cloud that hides
me ; under this Covert I shall see and not be seen .

not abroad to day , what ever the matter is .
Do
you hear , Sister Trash , Lady o ' the Basket ?
sit farther
with your Ginger-bread progeny there , and hinder not
the prospect of my Shop , or I 'll ha' it proclaim 'd i' the
Fair , what stuff they are made on .
Why , what stuff are they made on , Brother
Leather-head ?
nothing but what 's wholsome , I assure
Yes , stale Bread , rotten Eggs , musty Ginger , and
dead Hony , you know .
I ! have I met with enormity so soon ?
I shall mar your Market , old Jone .
Mar my Market , thou too-proud Pedler ?
do
thy worst , I defie thee , I , and thy Stable of Hobby-

thou wrong 'st me for all thou art parcel-Poet , and an

a Ballad of thee , and thy Cattle all over .
Are you puft
up with the pride of your Wares ?
your Arsedine ?
Go too , old Jone , I 'll talk with you anon ; and
take you down too , afore Justice Overdoo , he is the Man
must charm you , I 'll ha' you i' the Pie-pouldres .
Charm me ?
I 'll meet thee Face to Face , afore
his Worship , when thou dar 'st : and though I be a lit-
tle crooked o ' my body , I 'll be found as upright in my
dealing as any Woman in Smithfield ; I , charm me ?
I am glad to hear my name is their terror , yet
this is doing of Justice .

Alas , good Urs , was Zekiel here this morn -

Zekiel ?

Zekiel Edgworth , the civil Cut-purse , you know
him well enough ; he that talks bawdy to you still : I
call him my Secretary .

you 'll never think of any thing , till
your Dame be rump-gall 'd ; 'tis well , Changeling : be-
cause it can take in your Grass-hoppers Thighs , you
care for no more .
Now you look as you had been i'
the corner o ' the Booth , fleaing your Breech with a
Candles end , and set fire o ' the Fair .
Fill , Stote : fill .
This Pig-woman do I know , and I will put her in ,
for my second enormity ; she hath been before me ,
Punk , Pinnace , and Bawd , any time these two and twen-

'Pray you be not angry , Mistriss , I 'll ha' it wi -

No, no , I shall e 'en dwindle away to't , e 'er the

Apoor vex 'd thing I am , I feel my self dropping already ,
as fast as I can : two Stone a Sewet a day is my propor-
tion : I can but hold Life and Soul together , with this

at most .
Where 's my Pipe now ?
not fill 'd ?

Nay , Ursla , thou'lt gall between the Tongue and

that remembers nothing I say to him ?
but look too't ,
Sirrah , you were best , three Pence a Pipe full , I will ha'
made , of all my whole half Pound of Tabacco , and a
quarter of a Pound of Coltsfoot , mixt with it too , to eech

to seek in smoke , now .

to raise it .
Froth your Cans well i' the filling , at length
Rogue , and jog your Bottles o ' the Buttock , Sirrah ,
then skink out the first Glass , ever , and drink with all
Companies , though you be sure to be drunk ; you 'll
mis-reckon the better , and be less asham 'd on't .
But
your true trick , Raskal , must be , to be ever busie , and
mis-take away the Bottles and Cans , in haste , before
they be half drunk off , and never hear any body call ,
( if they should chance to mark you ) till you ha' brought
fresh , and be able to forswear 'em .

This is the very Womb , and Bed of enormity !
gross as her self ! this must all down for enormity , all ,

Look , who 's there , Sirrah ?
five Shillings a Pig is
my Price , at least ; if it be a Sow-pig , six Pence more ;
if she be a great bellied Wife , and long for't , six Pence
more for that .
O tempora ! O mores ! I would not ha' lost my dis -
covery of this one grievance , for my place , and worship
o ' the Bench , how is the poor abus 'd here ! well , I
will fall in with her , and with her Moon-calf , and win
out wonders of enormity .
By thy leave , goodly Wo -
man , and the fatness of the Fair : oily as the King 's Con-
stables Lamp , and shining as his Shooing-horn ! hath thy
Ale vertue , or thy Beer strength ?
that the Tongue of
Man may be tickled ?
and his Palate pleas 'd in the Morn -

let thy pretty Nephew here , go search and see .
What new Roarer is this ?
O Lord ! do you not know him , Mistris ?
'tis mad
Arthur of Bradley , that makes the Orations .
Brave Ma -

welcome to
the Fair ; when shall we hear you again , to handle your
matters ?
with your Back again a Booth , ha ?
I ha' bin
one o ' your little disciples , i' my days !
Let me drink , Boy , with my Love , thy Aunt ,
here ; that I may be eloquent : but of thy best , lest
it be bitter in my Mouth , and my words fall foul on
the Fair .
Why dost thou not fetch him Drink ?
and offer
him to sit ?
Is't Ale , or Beer ?
Master Arthur ?
Thy best , pretty stripling , thy best ; the same
thy Dove drinketh , and thou drawest on Holy-days .
Bring him a six Penny Bottle of Ale ; they say ,
a Fools hansel is lucky .
Bring both , Child .
Ale for Arthur , and Beer
for Bradley .
Ale for thine Aunt , Boy .
My disguise takes
to the very wish and reach of it .
I shall by the benefit
of this discover enough , and more : and yet get off
with the reputation of what I would be .
A certain
midling thing , between a Fool and a Madman .
WHat ! my little lean Ursla ! my she-Bear ! art
thou alive yet ?
with thy litter of Pigs , to grunt
out another Bartholmew Fair ?
ha !
Yes , and to amble afoot , when the Fair is done ,
to hear you groan out of a Cart , up the heavy Hill .
Of Holborn , Ursla , mean 'st thou so ?
for what ?
for what , pretty Urs ?
For cutting Half-penny Purses : or stealing little
penny Dogs , out o ' the Fair .
O ! good words , good words , Urs .
Another special enormity .
A cut-purse of the
Sword , the Boot , and the Feather ! those are his
You are one of those Horse-leaches that gave

No, 'twas better Meat Urs : Cows Udders , Cows

Well , I shall be-meet with your mumbling Mouth
one day .
What ?
thou'lt poyson me with a Neust in a Bot-
tle of Ale , will 't thou ?
or a Spider in a Tabacco-pipe ,
Urs ?
Come , there 's no malice in these fat Folks , I never
fear thee , and I can scape thy lean Moon-calf here .
Let 's
drink it out , good Urs , and no vapours !
Dost thou hear , Boy ?
( there 's for thy Ale , and
the remnant for thee ) speak in thy faith of a Faucet ,
now ; is this goodly Person before us here , this Vapours ,
a Knight of the Knife ?
What mean you by that , Master Arthur ?
I mean a Child of the Horn-thumb , a Babe of
booty , Boy , a Cutpurse .
O Lord , Sir ! far from it .
This is Master Dan .

Alas poor Urs , this 's an ill season for thee .
Hang your self , Hackney-man .
How ?
how ?
Urs , Vapours , motion breed Va -

Vapours ?
never tusk , nor twirle your Dibble ,
good Jordane , I know what you 'll take to a very drop .
Though you be Captain o ' the Roarers , and fight well
at the case of piss-pots , you shall not fright me with
your Lyon-chap , Sir , nor your Tusks ; you angry ?

Thou art such another mad merry Urs , still !

What do you lack , Gentlemen ?
Maid , see a
fine Hobby-horse for your young Master : cost you but
a token a Week his Provender .
Ha' you any Corns i' your Feet and Toes ?
Buy a Mouse-trap , a Mouse-trap , or a Tormen-

Buy some Ginger-bread .
Ballads , Ballads ! fine new Ballads :
Hear for your Love , and buy for your Money .

Or Saint George , that O ! did break the Dragons Heart !
Master Nightingale , come hither , leave your
Mart a little .
O my Secretary ! what says my Secretary ?
Child o ' the Bottles , what 's he ?
what 's he ?
A civil young Gentleman , Master Arthur , that
keeps company with the Roarers , and disburses all still .
He has ever Money in his Purse ; He pays for them ;
and they roar for him : one do 's good offices for another .
They call him the Secretary , but he serves no body .
Agreat Friend of the Ballad-mans , they are never asunder .
What pitty 'tis , so civil a young Man should
haunt this debaucht company ?
here 's the bane of the
youth of our time apparent .
A proper pen-man , I see 't
in his countenance , he has a good Clerks look with him ,
and I warrant him a quick hand .
A very quick hand , Sir .
All the Purses , and purchase , I give you to day
by conveyance , bring hither to Ursla 's presently .
Here
we will meet at night in her Lodg , and share .
Look
you chuse good places for your standing i' the Fair , when
you sing , Nightingale .
I , near the fullest passages ; and shift 'em often .
And i' your singing , you must use your Hawks
Eye nimbly , and fly the Purse to a mark , still , where 'tis
worn , and o ' which side ; that you may gi' me the sign
with your Beak , or hang your head that way i' the tune .
Enough , talk no more on't : your friendship
( Masters ) is not now to begin .
Drink your draught
of Indenture , your sup of Covenant , and away , the
Fair fills apace , company begins to come in , and I ha'
ne 'er a Pig ready yet .
Well said ! fill the Cups , and light the Tabacco :
let 's give fire i' th ' Works , and noble Vapours .
And shall we ha' Smocks Ursla , and good whim -
sies , ha ?
Come , you are i' your bawdy vain ! the best the
Fair will afford , Zekiel , if Bawd Whit keep his word ;
how do the Pigs , Moon-calf ?
Very passionate , Mistris , on ' on 'em has wept
out an Eye .
Master Arthur o'Bradley is melancholy ,
here , no body talks to him .
Will you any Tabacco
Master Arthur ?
No, Boy , let my meditations alone .
He 's studying for an Oration , now .
If I can with this days travel , and all my policy ,
but rescue this youth here out of the hands of the lewd
Man , and the strange Woman , I will sit down at night ,
and say with my Friend Ovid , Jamque opus exegi , quod
nec Jovis ira , nec ignis , &c .
Here Zekiel ; here 's a Health to Ursla , and a
kind Vapour : thou hast Money i' thy Purse still , and

Pray thee Vapour thy
Friends some in a courteous Vapour .
Half I have , Master Dan .
Knockhum , is always at
your service .
Ha , sweet nature ! what Goshawk would prey
upon such a Lamb ?
Let 's see , what 'tis , Zekiel ! count it , come , fill
him to pledge me .
WE are here before 'em , methinks .
All the better , we shall see 'em come in
What do you lack , Gentlemen , what is't you
lack ?
a fine Horse ?
a Lyon ?
a Bull ?
a Bear ?
a Dog ,
or a Cat ?
an excellent fine Bartholmew-bird ?
or an
Instrument ?
what is't you lack ?
' Slid ! here 's Orpheus among the Beasts , with his
Fiddle , and all !
Will you buy any comfortable Bread , Gen-
tlemen ?
And Ceres selling her Daughters Picture , in
Ginger-work !
That these People should be so ignorant to
think us chapmen for 'em ! do we look as if we would
buy Ginger-bread ?
or Hobby-horses ?
Why , they know no better Ware than they
have , nor better Customers than come .
And our very
being here makes us fit to be demanded , as well as o -
Would Cokes would come ! there were a true
customer for 'em .
How much is't ?
thirty Shillings ?
who 's yonder !
Ned Winwife ?
and Tom Quarlous , I think ! yes , ( gi' me it
all ) ( gi' me it all ) Master Winwife ! Master Quarlous !
will you take a Pipe of Tabacco with us ?
do not dis -
credit me now , Zekiel .
Do not see him ! he is the roaring Horse-courser ,
pray thee let 's avoid him : turn down this way .
' Slud
' Slud , I 'll see him , and roar with him too , and
he roar 'd as loud as Neptune ; pray thee go with me .
You may draw me to as likely an inconveni-
ence , when you please , as this .
Go to then , come along , we ha' nothing to do ,
man , but to see sights now .
Welcome Master Quarlous , and Master Win-wife !
will you take any froth , and smoak with us ?
Yes , Sir , but you 'l pardon us , if we knew not of
so much familiarity between us afore .
As what , Sir ?
To be so lightly invited to Smoak and Froth .
A good Vapour ! will you sit down , Sir ?
this is
Old Ursla 's Mansion , how like you her Bower ?
here you
may ha' your Punck and your Pig in State , Sir , both pi-
ping hot .
I had rather ha' my Punck cold , Sir .
There 's for me , Punck ! and Pig !
What Mooncalf , you Rogue ?
By and by , the Bottle is almost off , Mistris ; here
Master Arthur .
I 'll part you , and your Play-fellow there , i' the
garded Coat , an' you sunder not the sooner .
Master Win-wife , you are proud ( me thinks ) you
do not talk , nor drink , are you proud ?
Not of the company I am in , Sir , nor the place ,
I assure you .
You do not except at the Company ! do you !
are you in Vapours , Sir ?
Nay , good Master Dan .
Knockhum , respect my
Mistris Bower , as you call it ; for the Honour of our
Booth , none o ' your Vapours here .
Why , you thin lean Polecat you , and they have
a mind to be i' their Vapours , must you hinder 'em ?
what did you know , Vermine , if they would ha' lost a
Cloak , or such a Trifle ?
must you be drawing the Air
of Pacification here ?
while I am tormented within i'the
fire , you Weasel ?
Good Mistris , 'twas in the behalf of your Booth 's
Credit that I spoke .
Why ! would my Booth ha' broke , if they had
fal 'n out in't , Sir ?
or would their heat ha' fir 'd it ?
In ,
you Rogue , and wipe the Pigs , and mend the Fire , that
they fall not , or I 'll both baste and roast you till your
Eyes drop out , like 'em .
( Leave the Bottle behind you ,
and be curst a while . )
Body o ' the Fair ! what 's this ?
Mother o ' the
Bawds ?
No, she 's Mother o ' the Pigs , Sir , Mother o ' the
Mother o ' the Furies , I think , by her Fire -
Nay , she is too fat to be a Fury , sure some walk -

An inspir 'd Vessel of Kitchin-stuff !
She 'll make Excellent Geer for the Coachma -

I , I , Gamesters , mock a plain plump soft Wench
o ' the Suburbs , do , because she 's juicy and wholesome :
you must ha' your thin pinch 'd Ware , pent up i' the
compass of a Dog-Collar , ( or 'twill not do ) that looks
like a long lac 'd Conger , set upright , and a green feather ,
like Fennel i' the Joll on't .
Well said , Urs , my good Urs ; to 'em Urs .
Is she your Quag-mire , Dan .
Knockhum ?
is this
your Bog ?
We shall have a quarrel presently .
How , Bog ?
Quagmire ?
foul Vapours ! humh !
Yes , he that would venture for't , I assure him ,
might sink into her , and be drown 'd a week , e 're any
Friend he had could find where he were .
And then he would be a fort 'night weighing up
' Twere like falling into a whole Shire of But -

him out .
Answer 'em , Urs , where 's thy Bartholmew-wit
now , Urs , thy Bartholmew-wit ?
Hang 'em , rotten , Roguy Cheaters , I hope to
see 'em plagu 'd one day ( pox 'd they are already , I am
sure ) with lean Play-house Poultry , that has the Bony
Rump , sticking out like the Ace of Spades , or the point
of a Partizan , that every Rib of 'em is like the Tooth
of a Saw : and will so grate 'em with their Hips and
Shoulders , as ( take 'em altogether ) they were as good lie
with a hurdle .
Out upon her , how she drips ! She 's able to

Do you think there may be a fine new

Gentlemen , these are very strange Vapours ! and
very idle Vapours ! I assure you .
You are a very serious Ass , we assure you .
Humh ! Ass ?
and serious ?
nay , then pardon
me my Vapour .
I have a foolish Vapour , Gentlemen :
any man that does vapour me the Ass , Master Quar-

Are you under-peering ,
you Baboon ?

Run you for some Cream , good Mother Jone .
I 'll look to your Basket .
Best sit up i' your Chair , Ursla .
Help , Gen-
Be of good cheer , Urs , thou hast hindred me
the currying of a Couple of Stallions here , that abus 'd
the good Race-Bawd o ' Smithfield ; 'twas time for 'em
to go .
I'faith , when the Pan came , they had made you
run else .
( This had been a fine time for purchase , if you
had ventur 'd . )
Not a whit , these fellows were too fine to carry
Nightingale , get some help to carry her Leg out
o ' the Air ; take off her Shooes ; body o ' me , she has the
Mallanders , the Scratches , the Crown Scab , and the Quit-
ter Bone i' the to'ther Leg .
Oh , the Pox ! why do you put me in mind o '
my Leg thus , to make it prick and shoot ?
would you ha'
me i'the Hospital afore my time ?
Patience , Urs , take a good heart , 'tis but a Bli-
ster as big as a Windgall ; I 'll take is away with the white
of an Egg , a little Honey and Hogs Grease , ha' thy Pa -
sterns well roll 'd , and thou shalt pace again by to mor-
I 'll tend thy Booth , and look to thy Affairs the
while : Thou shalt sit i' thy Chair , and give Directions ,
and shine Ursa major .
THese are the Fruits of Bottle Ale and Tabacco! the
Fome of the one , and the Fumes of the other ! Stay
young man , and despise not the Wisdom of these few
Hairs that are grown gray in care of thee .
Nightingale , stay a little .
Indeed I 'll hear some
o ' this !
Come , Numps , come , where are you ?
Welcome
into the Fair , Mistris Grace .
' Slight , he will call Company , you shall see , and
put us into doings presently .
Thirst not after that frothy Liquor , Ale : for
who knows when he openeth the Stopple , what may be
in the Bottle ?
Hath not a Snail , a Spider , yea , a Neust
been found there ?
thirst not after it , youth : thirst not
after it .
This is a brave Fellow , Numps , let 's hear him .
'Sblood , how brave is he ?
in a garded Coat ?
You were best truck with him , e 'en strip , and truck
presently , it will become you , why will you hear
him , because he is an Ass , and may be a-kin to the
O , good Numps !
Neither do thou lust after that Tawny Weed ,
Brave words !
Whose Complexion is like the Indians that
vents it !
Are they not brave words , Sister ?
And who can tell , if before the gathering and
making up thereof , the Alligarta hath not piss 'd
thereon ?
' Heart let 'em be brave words , as brave as they
will ! and they were all the brave words in a Countrey ,
how then ?
will you away yet ?
ha' you enough on him ?
Mistris Grace , come you away , I pray you , be not you
If you do lose your Licence , or somewhat
else , Sir , with listning to his Fables , say Numps is a
Witch , with all my heart , do , say so .
Avoid i' your Sattin Doublet , Numps .

pent , as some late Writers affirm , neither the cut -
ting of the perillous Plant , nor the drying of it , nor
the lighting or burning , can any way persway or as-
Good i' faith ! is't not , Sister ?
Hence it is that the Lungs of the Tabacconist
are rotted , the Liver spotted , the Brain smoak 'd like
the Back-side of the Pig-womans Booth here , and the
whole Body within , black as her Pan you saw e 'en now
A fine Similitude , that , Sir ! did you see the
Pan ?
Yes , Sir .
Nay , the hole in the Nose here , of some Ta -
bacco-takers , or the Third Nostril , ( if I may so call it )
which makes , that they can vent the Tabacco out ,
like the Ace of Clubs , or rather the Flower-de-lice , is
caused from the Tabacco , the meer Tabacco! when
the poor innocent Pox , having nothing to do there , is
miserably and most unconscionably slander 'd .
Who would ha' mist this , Sister ?
Not any body but Numps .
He does not understand .
Nor you feel .
What would you have , Sister , of a Fellow
that knows nothing but a Basket-Hilt , and an Old
Fox in't ?

In , to Ursla , Nightingale , and carry her comfort :
see it told .
This Fellow was sent to us by Fortune , for
our first Fairing .
But what speak I of the Diseases of the Body ,
Children of the Fair ?
That 's to us , Sister .
Brave i' faith !
Hark , O you Sons and Daughters of Smithfield !
and hear what malady it doth the Mind : It causeth
swearing , it causeth swaggering , it causeth snuffling and
snarling , and now and then a hurt .
He hath something of Master Over-doo , me
thinks , brother .
So me thought , Sister , very much of my Brother
Over-doo : And 'tis when he speaks .
Look into any Angle o ' Town , ( the Streights , or
the Bermuda 's ) where the Quarrelling Lesson is read ,
and how do they entertain the time , but with Bottle
Ale and Tabacco ?
The Lecturer is o ' one side , and his
Pupils o ' the other ; But the Seconds are still Bottle Ale
and Tabacco , for which the Lecturer reads , and the
Novices pay .
Thirty Pound a week in Bottle Ale !
Forty in Tabacco! and Ten more in Ale again .
Then
for a Suit to drink in , so much , and ( that being slaver 'd )
so much for another Suit , and then a Third Suit , and a
Fourth Suit ! and still the Bottle Ale slavereth , and the
Tabacco stinketh !
Heart of a mad man ! are you rooted here ?
Will you never away ?
What can any man find out in
this bawling Fellow , to grow here for ?
He is a full hand -
ful higher sin' he heard him .
Will you fix here , and set
up a Booth , Sir ?
I will conclude briefly ?
Hold your peace , you roaring Rascal , I 'll run
my Head i' your Chaps else .
You were best build a
Booth , and entertain him ; make your Will , and you
say the Word , and him your Heir ! Heart , I never
knew one taken with a Mouth of a Peck afore .
By
this Light , I 'll carry you away o ' my back , and you will
not come .
Stay , Numps , stay , set me down : I ha' lost my
Purse , Numps , O my Purse ! One o ' my fine Purses is
Is't indeed , Brother ?
I , as I am an honest man , would I were an er-
rant Rogue else ! a plague of all roguy damn 'd Cut-
purses for me .
Bless 'em with all my heart , with all my heart ,
do you see ! Now , as I am no Infidel , that I know of ,
I am glad on't .
I , I am , ( here 's my Witness ) do you
see , Sir ?
I did not tell you of his Fables , I ?
no , no , I
am a dull Malt-Horse , I , I know nothing .
Are you
not justly serv 'd , i' your Conscience now ?
Speak
i' your Conscience .
Much good do you with all
my heart , and his good heart that has it , with all my
heart again .
This Fellow is very Charitable , would he
had a Purse too ! But I must not be too bold all at a
Nay , Numps , it is not my best Purse .
Not your best ! death ! why should it be your
worst ?
why should it be any , indeed , at all ?
Answer

be any ?
Nor my Gold , Numps ; I ha' that yet , look here

Why so , there 's all the feeling he has !
I pray you , have a better care of that , Bro-
Nay , so I will , I warrant you ; let him catch
this that catch can .
I would fain see him get this , look

So , so , so , so , so , so , so , so ! Very good .
I would ha' him come again now , and
but offer at it .
Sister , will you take notice of
a good Jest ?
I will put it just where th ' other
was , and if we ha' good luck , you shall see
a delicate fine Trap to catch the Cut-purse nib -

I ha' Gold left
to gi' thee a Fairing yet , as hard as the World goes : no
thing angers me but that no body here look 'd like a
Cut-purse , unless 'twere Numps .
How ?
I? I look like a Cut-purse ?

John Little-wit !
And his Wife , and my Widow , her Mother :
the whole Family .
' Slight , you must gi'em all Fairings now !
Not I , I 'll not see 'em .
They are going a feasting .
What Schoolma -

That 's my Rival , I believe , the Baker !
So , walk on in the middle way , fore-right , turn

What do you lack ?
what do you buy , pretty Mi-
stris ?
a fine Hobby-horse , to make your Son a Tilter ?
Drum , to make him a Soldier ?
a Fiddle , to make him a
Reveller ?
What is't you lack ?
Little Dogs for your
Daughters ?
or Babies , Male or Female ?
Look not toward them , harken not : the place
is Smithfield , or the Field of Smiths , the Grove of Hob -
by-horses and Trinkets , the Wares are the Wares of De-
And the whole Fair is the Shop of Satan ! They
are Hooks and Baits , very Baits , that are hung out on
every side , to catch you , and to hold you , as it were , by
the Gills , and by the Nostrils , as the Fisher doth : There -
fore you must not look nor turn toward them ?
The
Heathen man could stop his Ears with Wax against the
Harlot o'the Sea : Do you the like with your Fingers a -
gainst the Bells o ' the Beast .
What flashes comes from him !
O , he has those of his Oven ! a notable hot Ba -
ker 'twas , when he ply 'd he Peel : he is leading his Flock
into the Fair now .
Rather driving 'em to the Pens : for he will
let 'em look upon nothing .
Gentlewomen , the weather 's hot ! whither walk
you ?
Have a care o ' your fine Velvet Caps , the Fair
is dusty .
Take a sweet delicate Booth , with Boughs ,
here i' the way , and cool your selves i' the shade ; you
and your Friends .
The best Pig and Bottle Ale i' the

Have you forgot the wholesome Admonition so
soon ?
Good Mother , how shall we find a Pig , if we
do not look about for't ?
Will it run off o ' the Spit
into our mouths , think you ?
as in Lubberland ?
and cry ,

No, but your Mother , religiously wise , concei-

And it were a Sin of Obstinacy ,
great Obstinacy , high and horrible Obsti-

Therefore be bold

of the Unclean , for once , and satisfie your Wives
Let your frail Wife be satisfied : your zea -

Come , Win , as good winny here as go farther ,
and see nothing .
We scape so much of the other Vanities , by our

It is an edifying Consideration .
This is scurvy , that we must come into the Fair ,
and not look on't .
Win , have patience , Win , I 'll tell you more a -
Moon-calf , entertain within there , the best Pig i'
the Booth ; a Pork-like Pig .
These are Banbury-bloods ,

Whit , look to your Charge .
A Pig prepare presently , let a Pig be prepared
to us .
' Slight , who be these ?
Is this the good Service , Jordan , you 'ld do
me ?
Why , Urs ?
why , Urs ?
thou'lt ha Vapours i'
thy Leg again presently , pray thee to in , 't may turn
to the Scratches else .
Hang your Vapours , they are stale , and stink like
you , are these the Guests o ' the Game you promis 'd to fill
my Pit withal to day ?
I , what ail they , Urs ?
Ail they ?
they are all Sippers , Sippers o'the Ci-
ty , they look as they would not drink off two penn'orth
of Bottle Ale amongst 'em ,
A body may read that i' their small printed
Away , thou art a Fool , Urs , and thy Moon -
calf too , i' your ignorant Vapours now : Hence , good
Guests , I say , right Hypocrites , good Gluttons .
In ,
and set a Couple o ' Pigs o ' the Board , and Half a
Dozen of the biggest Bottles afore 'em , and call Whit :
I do not love to hear Innocents abus 'd : Fine amb -
ling Hypocrites ! and a Stone-Puritan with a Sorrel
Head and Beard , good mouth 'd Gluttons : Two to a
Pig , away .
Are you sure they are such ?
O' the right Breed , thou shalt try 'em by the
Teeth , Urs , where 's this Whit ?
Behold , man , and see , what a worthy man am ee !
With the Fury of my Sword , and the shaking of my
Beard ,
I will make Ten Thousand Men afeard .
Well said , brave Whit , in , and fear the Ale out
o ' the Bottles into the Bellies of the Brethren , and the
Sisters drink to the Cause , and pure Vapours .
My Roarer is turn 'd Tapster , me thinks .
Now were a fine time for thee , Win-wife , to lay a -
board thy Widow , thou'lt never be a Master of a bet-
ter season or place ; She that will venture her self into
the Fair , and a Pig-box , will admit any Assault , be as-
sur 'd of that .
I love not Enterprises of that suddenness tho .
I 'll warrant thee then , no Wife out o ' the Wid -
dows Hundred : if I had but as much Title to her , as to
have breath 'd once on that streight Stomacher of hers ,
I would now assure my self to carry her , yet ere she
went out of Smithfield .
Or she should carry me , which
were the fitter sight I confess .
But you are a modest
undertaker , by Circumstances and Degrees ; come , 'tis
Disease in thee , not Judgment .
I should offer at all to -

tragical Conclusions .
And I begin now to think ,
that by a spice of collateral Justice , Adam Overdoo de-
serv 'd this beating ; for I the said Adam was one Cause
( a By-cause ) why the Purse was lost : and my Wives
Brothers Purse too , which they know not of yet .
But I
shall make very good mirth with it at Supper , ( that will
be the sport ) and put my little Friend , Mr. Humphrey
Wasp 's Choler quite out of countenance .
When , sitting
at the upper end o ' my Table , as I use , and drinking
to my Brother Cokes , and Mrs. Alice Overdoo , as I will ,
my Wife , for their good affection to old Bradley , I deli-
ver to 'em , it was I that was cudgell 'd , and shew 'em the
To see what bad Events may peep out o ' the
Tail of good Purposes ! the Care I had of that ci-
vil young Man , I took fancy to this Morning , ( and
have not left it yet ) drew me to that exhortation , which
drew the Company indeed ; which drew the Cut-purse ;
which drew the Money ; which drew my Brother Cokes
his loss : which drew on Wasp 's anger ; which drew on
my beating : a pretty gradation ! And they shall ha' it
i' their Dish i' faith at night for Fruit ; I love to be mer-
ry at my Table .
I had thought once , at one special
blow he ga' me , to have revealed my self ; but then ( I
thank thee fortitude ) I remembred that a wise Man
( and who is ever so great a part o ' the Common-wealth
in himself ) for no particular disaster ought to abandon
a publick good Design .
The Husband-man ought not
for one unthankful Year , to forsake the Plough ; the
Shepherd ought not for one scab 'd Sheep to throw by his
Tar-box ; the Pilot ought not for one Leak i' the Poop
to quit the Helm ; nor the Alderman ought not for one
Custard more at a Meal to give up his Cloak ; the Con-
stable ought not to break his Staff , and forswear the
Watch for one roaring Night ; nor the Piper o ' the Pa -
rish ( Ut parvis componere magna solebam ) to put up his
Pipes for one rainy Sunday .
These are certain knock -
ing Conclusions ; out of which , I am resolv 'd , come
what come can , come Beating , come Imprisonment ,
come Infamy , come Banishment ; nay , come the Rack ,
come the Hurdle , ( welcom all ) I will not discover who
I am , till my due time ; and yet still , all shall be , as I
said ever , in Justice name , and the King 's , and for the
What does he talk to himself , and act so seri-
ously ?
poor Fool !
No matter what .
Here 's fresher Argument , in-
tend that .
COme , Mistris Grace , come Sister , here 's more fine
sights , yet i' faith .
Gods 'lid where 's Numps ?
What do you lack , Gentlemen ?
what is't you buy ?
fine Rattles ! Drums ?
Babies ?
little Dogs ?
and Birds
for Ladies ?
What do you lack ?
Good honest Numps , keep afore , I am so afraid
thou'lt lose somewhat : my Heart was at my Mouth ,
when I mist thee .
You were best buy a Whip i' your Hand to
drive me .
Nay , do not mistake , Numps , thou art so apt to
mistake : I would but watch the Goods .
Look you now ,
the treble Fiddle , was e 'en almost like to be lost .
Pray you take heed you lose not your self : your
best way , were e 'en get up , and ride for more surety .
Buy a tokens worth of great Pins , to fasten your self to
my Shoulder .
What do you lack , Gentlemen ?
fine Purses ,
Pouches , Pincases , Pipes ?
What is't you lack ?

o ' Smiths to wake you i' the Morning ?
or a fine whist-

Numps , here be finer things then any we ha'
bought by odds ! and more delicate Horses , a great deal

to bestow 'em on ?
ha' you ?
No, but again I ha' Children , Numps , that 's all
Do , do , do , do ; how many shall you have , think
you ?
an' I were as you , I'ld buy for all my Tenants too ,
they are a kind o ' civil Savages , that will part with their
Children for Rattles , Pipes , and Knives .
You were
best buy a Hatchet , or two , and truck with 'em .
Good Numps , hold that little Tongue o ' thine , and
save it a labour .
I am resolute Bat , thou know 'st .
A resolute Fool , you are , I know , and a very
sufficient Coxcomb ; with all my Heart ; nay you have
it , Sir , and you be angry , Turd i' your Teet , twice : ( if I
said it not once afore ) and much good do you .
Was there ever such a self-affliction ?
and so im -
pertinent ?
Alas ! his care will go neer to crack him , let 's
in , and comfort him .
Would I had been set i' the ground , all but the
head on me , and had my Brains bowl 'd at , or thresh 'd
out , when first I underwent this plague of a charge !
How now Numps ?
almost tir 'd i' your Protector-
ship ?
overparted ?
overparted ?
Why , I cannot tell , Sir , it may be I am , dos't
grieve you ?
No, I swear dos't not , Numps : to satisfie you .
Numps ?
'Sblood , you are fine and familiar ! how
long ha' we been acquainted , I pray you ?
I think it may be remembred , Numps , that ?
'twas since Morning sure .
Why , I hope I know't well enough , Sir , I did
not ask to be told .
No ?
why then ?
It 's no matter why , you see with your Eyes , now ,
what I said to you to day ?
you 'll believe me another
time ?
Are you removing the Fair , Numps ?
A pretty question ! and a very civil one ! yes faith ,
I ha' my lading you see ; or shall have anon , you may
know whose Beast I am by my Burthen .
If the Pan-
nier-mans Jack were ever better known by his Loyns of
Mutton , I 'll be flead , and feed Dogs for him when his
time comes .
How melancholick Mistris Grace is yonder ! pray
thee let 's go enter our selves in Grace , with her .
Those six Horses , Friend I 'll have ? ?
How !
G g g Cok .
And
And the three Jews-trumps ; and half a dozen
o ' Birds , and that Drum , ( I have one Drum already )
and your Smiths ; I like that device o ' your Smiths ,
very pretty well , and four Halberts ?
and ( le ' me see )
that fine painted great Lady , and her three Women for
state , I 'll have .
No, the Shop ; buy the whole Shop , it will be
best , the Shop , the Shop !
If his Worship please .
Yes , and keep it during the Fair , Bobchin .
Peace , Numps .
Friend , do not meddle with him ,
an' you be wise , and would shew your Head above
board : he will sting thorow your wrought Night-cap ,
believe me .
A set of these Violins , I would buy too ,
for a delicate young noise I have i' the Countrey , that
are every one a size less then another , just like your
I would fain have a fine young Masque at my
Marriage , now I think on't : but I do want such a
number o ' things .
And Numps will not help me now ,
and I dare not speak to him .
Will your Worship buy any Ginger-bread , very
good Bread , comfortable Bread ?
Ginger-bread ! yes , let 's see .
There 's the t 'other sprindge ?
Is this well , goody Jone ?
to interrupt my Mar-
ket in the midst ?
and call away my Customers ?
can
you answer this at the Piepouldres ?
Why ?
if his Master-ship have a mind to buy , I
hope my Ware lies as open as another 's ; I may shew
my Ware as well as you yours .
Hold your peace ; I 'll content you both : I 'll buy
up his Shop and thy Basket .
Will you i' faith ?
Why should you put him from it Friend ?
Cry you mercy ! you 'ld be sold too , would you ?
what 's the price on you ?
Jerkin , and all as you stand ?
ha' you any Qualities ?
Yes , Good-man-angry-man , you shall find he
has Qualities if you cheapen him .
Gods so , you ha' the selling of him ! what are
they ?
will they be bought for Love or Money ?
No indeed , Sir .
For what then , Victuals ?
He scorns Victuals , Sir , he has Bread and But -
ter at home , thanks be to God ! and yet he will do more
for a good Meal , if the Toy take him i' the Belly : mar-
ry then they must not set him at lower ends ; if they do ,
he 'll go away though he fast .
But put him a top o ' the
Table , where his place is , and he 'll do you forty fine things .
He has not been sent for , and sought out for nothing , at
your great City-suppers , to put down Coriat and Cokeley ,
and been laught at for his labour ; he 'll play you all the
Puppets i' the Town over , and the Players , every Compa-
ny , and his own Company too ; he spares no body !
I ' faith ?
He was the first , Sir , that ever baited the Fellow
i' the Bear 's Skin , an't like your Worship : no Dog ever
came near him since .
And for fine Motions !
Is he good at those too ?
can he set out a Mask
trow ?
O Lord , Master ! sought to far and neer for his
Inventions : and he engrosses all , he makes all the Pup -
pets i' the Fair .
Do 'st thou ( in troth ) old Velvet Jerkin ?
give
me thy hand .
Nay , Sir , you shall see him in his Velvet Jerkin ,
and a Scarf too , at night , when you hear him interpret
Master Little-wit 's Motion .
Speak no more , but shut up Shop presently ,
Friend , I 'll buy both it and thee too , to carry down
with me , and her Hamper , beside .
Thy Shop shall fur-
nish out the Mask , and hers the Banquet : I cannot go
less , to set out any thing with credit .
What 's the price ,
at a word , o ' thy whole Shop , Case , and all as it stands ?
Sir , it stands me in Six and twenty Shilling se-
ven Pence half-penny , besides Three Shillings for my
Well , Thirty Shillings will do all , then ! And
what comes yours too ?
Four Shillings and eleven Pence , Sir , Ground
and all , an't like your Worship .
Yes , it does like my Worship very well , poor
Woman , that 's Five Shillings more , what a Mask shall I
furnish out , for Forty Shillings ?
( Twenty pound Scotch )
and a Banquet of Ginger-bread ?
there 's a stately thing !
Numps ?
Sister ?
and my Wedding Gloves too ?
( that I
never thought on afore . )
All my Wedding Gloves ,
Ginger-bread ?
O me ! what a device will there be ?
to
make 'em eat their Fingers ends ! and delicate Brooches
for the Bride-men ! and all ! and then I 'll ha' this Poesie
put to 'em : For the best Grace , meaning Mistris Grace ,
my Wedding Poesie .
I am beholden to you , Sir , and to your Bar-
tholomew Wit .
You do not mean this , do you ?
is this your
first Purchase ?
Yes faith , and I do not think , Numps , but thou'lt
Like enough ! I shall say any thing .
I !
yet ; my Project is how to fetch off this proper young
Man from his debaucht Company : I have followed him
all the Fair over , and still I find him with this songster :
And I begin shrewdly to suspect their familiarity ; and
the young Man of a terrible taint , Poetry ! with which
idle Disease , if he be infected , there 's no hope of him ,
in a State-course .
Yonder he is buying o ' Ginger-bread : set in quick -
ly , before he part with too much of his Money .
My Masters and Friends , and good People , draw neer , &c .
Ballads ! hark , hark ! pray thee , Fellow , stay a
little , good Numps , look to the Goods .
What Ballads
hast thou ?
let me see , let me see my self .
Why so ! he 's flown to another Lime-bush , there
he will flutter as long more ; till he ha' ne 'er a Feather
Is there a vexation like this , Gentlemen ?
will you
believe me now , hereafter ?
shall I have Credit with
you ?
Yes faith , shalt thou , Numps , and thou art
worthy on't , for thou sweatest for't .
I never saw a
young Pimp-errant and his Squire better match 'd .
Faith , the Sister comes after 'em , well too .
Nay , if you saw the Justice her Husband , my
Guardian , you were fitted for the Mess , he is such a wise
one his way ?
I wonder , we see him not here .
O ! he is too serious for this Place , and yet better
sport then than the other three , I assure you , Gentlemen :
where ere he is , though't be o ' the Bench .
How dost thou call it ! A Caveat against

Look you Sister , here , here , let him
come , Sister , and welcome .
Ballad-man , does any
Cut-purses haunt hereabout ?
pray thee raise me one or
two : begin and shew me one .
Sir ,
Sir , this is a Spell against 'em , spick and span
new ; and 'tis made as 'twere in mine own Person , and
I sing it in mine own defence .
But 'twill cost a Penny
alone if you buy it .
No matter for the price , thou dost not know me ,
I see , I am an odd Bartholmew .
Ha 'st a fine Picture , Brother ?
O Sister , do you remember the Ballads over the
Nursery-chimney at home o ' my own pasting up , there
be brave Pictures .
Other manner of Pictures than these
Yet these will serve to pick the Pictures out o '
your Pockets , you shall see .
So I heard 'em say .
Pray thee mind him not ,
Fellow : he 'll have an Oar in every thing .
It was intended Sir , as if a Purse should chance
to be cut in my Presence , now , I may be blamless tho' :
as by the Sequel will more plainly appear .
We shall find that i' the matter .
Pray thee be-
To the tune of Paggingtons Pound , Sir ,
Fa , la la la , la la la , fa la la la .
Nay , I 'll put
thee in tune , and all ! mine own Country dance ! Pray
thee begin .
It is a gentle Admonition , you must know , Sir ,
both to the Purse-cutter , and the Purse-bearer .
Not a word more , out o ' the tune , an' thou lov'st
me : Fa , la la la , la la la , fa la la la .
Come , when ?
My Masters and Friends , and good People draw near ,
And look to your Purses , for that I do say ;
Ha , ha , this Chimes ! good counsel at first dash .
And tho ' little Money , in them you do bear .
Good !
It cost more to get , then to lose in a day .
You oft have been told ,
Well said !

Is there
any harm i' this ?
The

It hath been upbraided to Men of my
Trade ,
That oftentimes we are the Cause of this Crime .

On I pray thee , he that made this
Ballad , shall be Poet to my Mask .

Youth , youth , &c ?
pray thee stay a little , Friend ,
yet o ' thy Conscience , Numps , speak , is there auy harm

To tell you true , 'tis too good for you , less you

It doth discover enormity , I 'll mark it more : I
ha' not lik 'd a paltry piece of Poetry so well a good
Youth , Youth , &c ! where 's this Youth now ?
AMan must call upon him for his own good , and yet
he will not appear : look here , here 's for him ; Handy-
dandy , which Hand will he have ?
On , I pray thee ,
with the rest , I do hear of him , but I cannot see him ,
this Master Youth , the Cut-purse .
At Plays and at Sermons , and at the Sessions ,
' Tis daily their practice such booty to make :
Yea , under the Gallows , at Executions ,
They stick not the Stare-abouts Purses to take .

That was
a fine Fellow !
I would have
him now .
Nay one without grace ,
at a better Place
At Court , and in Christmas , before the
King 's Face ,

That only belongs to the cunning Cut-purse ?
But where 's their cunning , now , when they
should use it ?
they are all chain 'd now , I warrant you .
Youth , youth , thou hadst better , &c .
The Rat-catchers
Charm , are all Fools and Asses to this ! A pox on 'em ,
that they will not come ! that a Man should have such a
desire to a thing , and want it .
' Fore God I'ld give half the Fair , and 'twere
mine , for a Cut-purse for him to save his longing .
Look you Sister , here , here , where is't now ?
which Pocket is't in , for a Wager ?
I beseech you leave your Wagers , and let him
end his Matter an't may be .
O , are you edified Numps ?
Indeed he do 's interrupt him , too much : There
Numps spoke to Purpose .

And though you go gay ,
In Silks as you may ,
It is not the high way to Heaven ,

An excellent Ballad ! an excellent Ballad !
Friend , let me ha' the first , let me ha' the first ,
I pray you .
Pardon me , Sir . First come , first serv 'd ; and
I 'll buy the whole bundle too .
That conveyance was better then all , did you
see 't ?
he has given the Purse to the Ballad-singer .
Has he ?
Sir , I cry you mercy : I 'll not hinder the poor
Mans Profit : pray you mistake me not .
G g g 2 Cok .
Sir ,
Sir , I take you for an honest Gentleman ; if
that be mistaking , I met you to day afore : ha ! humh !
O God ! my Purse is gone , my Purse , my Purse , &c .
Come do not make a stir , and cry your self an
Ass , thorow the Fair afore your time .
Why , hast thou it , Numps , good Numps , how
came you by it ?
I marl !
I pray you seek some other Gamester to play the
Fool with : you may lose it time enough , for all your
Fair Wit .
By this good Hand , Glove and all , I ha' lost it
already , if thou hast it not : feel else , and Mistris
Grace 's Handkercher too , out o ' the t 'other Pocket .
Why , 'tis well ; very well , exceeding pretty ,
and well .
Are you sure you ha' lost it , Sir ?
O God ! yes ; as I am an honest Man , I had it
but e 'en now , at youth , youth .
I hope you suspect not me , Sir .
Thee ?
that were a jest indeed ! Dost thou
think the Gentleman is foolish ?
where hadst thou hands ,
I pray thee ?
Away Ass , away .
I shall be beaten again , if I be spi 'd .
Sir , I suspect an odd Fellow , yonder , is stealing
Brother , it is the preaching Fellow ! you shall
suspect him .
He was at your t 'other Purse , you know !
Nay stay , Sir , and view the work you ha' done , an' you
be benefic 'd at the Gallows , and preach there , thank
your own Handy-work .
Sir , you shall take no pride in your Preferment :
you shall be silenc 'd quickly .
What do you mean sweet Buds of Gentility .
To ha' my Penyworths out on you : Bud .
No
less then two Purses a day serve you ?
I thought you a
simple Fellow , when my Man Numps beat you i' the
Morning , and pittied you ?
So did I , I 'll be sworn , Brother ; but now I see
he is a lewd , and pernicious Enormity : ( as Master
Overdoo calls him . )
Mine own words turn 'd upon me , like Swords .
Cannot a Man 's Purse be at quiet for you , i' the
Masters Pocket , but you must intice it forth and de-
bauch it ?
Sir , Sir , keep your debauch , and your fine Bar-
tholmew Terms to your self ; and make as much on 'em
as you please .
But gi' me this from you , i' the mean
time : I beseech you , see if I can look to this .
Why , Numps ?
Why ?
because you are an Ass , Sir , there 's a
Reason the shortest way , and you will needs ha' it ; now
you ha' got the trick of losing , you 'ld lose your Breech
an't 'twere loose .
I know you , Sir , come , deliver ,
you 'll go and crack the Vermine you breed now , will
you ?
'tis very fine , will you ha' the Truth on't ?
they
are such retchless Flies as you are , that blow Cut-purses
abroad in every Corner ; your foolish having of Mo -
ney makes 'em .
An' there were no wiser then I , Sir ,
the Trade should lye open for you , Sir , it should i' faith ,
Sir . I would teach your Wit to come to your Head , Sir ,
as well as your Land to come into your Hand , I assure
you , Sir .
Alack , good Numps .
Nay , Gentlemen , never pitty me , I am not
worth it : Lord send me at home once , to Harrow o ' the
Hill again , if I travel any more , call me Coriat ; withal
my heart .
Stay , Sir , I must have a word with you in pri-
Do you hear .
With me , Sir , what 's your Pleasure ?
good Sir .
Do not deny it .
You are a Cut-purse , Sir , this
Gentleman here , and I saw you , nor do we mean to de-
tect you ( though we can sufficiently inform our selves ,
toward the danger of concealing you ) but you must do
us a piece of Service .
Good Gentlemen , do not undo me ; I am a
civil young Man , and but a beginner , indeed .
Sir , your beginning shall bring on your ending
for us .
We are no Catchpoles nor Constables .
That
you are to undertake is this ; you saw the old Fellow ,
with the black Box here ?
The little old Governour , Sir ?
The same : I see , you have flown him to a
Mark already .
I would ha' you get away that Box from
him , and bring it us .
Would you ha' the Box and all , Sir ?
or only
that that is in't ?
I 'll get you that , and leave him the
Box to play with still : ( which will be the harder o ' the
two ) because I would gain your Worships good Opini-
on of me .
He says well , 'tis the greater Mastry , and 'twill
make the more sport when 'tis mist .
I , and 'twill be the longer a missing , to draw on
the sport .
But look you do it now , Sirrah , and keep your
word : or ? ?
Sir , if ever I break my word with a Gentleman ,
may I never read word at my need .
Where shall I find
you ?
Some where i' the Fair , hereabouts .
Dispatch
it quickly .
I would fain see the careful Fool deluded !
of all Beasts , I love the serious Ass .
He that takes pains
to be one , and plays the fool with the greatest diligence
that can be .
Then you would not chose , Sir , but love my
Guardian , Justice Overdoo , who is answerable to that de-
scription in every Hair of him .
So I have heard .
But how came you Mistris
Welborn , to be his Ward ?
or have relation to him , at
first ?
Faith , through a common Calamity , he bought
me , Sir ; and now he will marry me to his Wives Bro-
ther , this wise Gentleman that you see , or else I must
pay value o ' my Land .
' Slid , is there no device of disparagement ?
or
so ; talk with some crafty Fellow , some Picklock o ' the
Law ! Would I had studied a year longer i' the Inns of
Court , and't had been but i' your Case .
I Master Quarlous , are you proffering ?
You 'ld bring but little Aid , Sir .
( I 'll look to you 'i faith , Gamester . )
An un-
fortunate foolish Tribe you are faln into , Lady , I won-
der you can endure 'em .
Sir , they that cannot work their Fetters off must
wear 'em .
You see what care they have on you , to leave
you thus .
Faith the same they have of themselves , Sir . I
cannot greatly complain , if this were all the Plea I had
against 'em .
' Tis true ! but will you please to withdraw with
us a little , and make them think they have lost you .
Ihope our Manners ha' been such hitherto , and our Lan-
guage , as will give you no Cause , to doubt your self
in our Company .
Sir , I will give my self no cause ; I am so secure
of mine own Manners , as I suspect not yours .
Look where John Little-wit comes .
Away , I 'll not be seen by him .
No, you were not best , he 'ld tell his Mother ,
the Widdow .
Heart , what do you mean ?
Cry you mercy , is the Wind there ?
must not
the Widdow be nam 'd ?
DO you hear , Win , Win ?
What say you , John ?
While they are paying the Reckoning , Win , I 'll
tell you a thing , Win ; we shall never see any Sights i'
the Fair , Win , except you long still , Win ; good Win ,
sweet Win , long to see some Hobby-horses , and some
Drums , and Rattles , and Dogs , and fine Devices , Win .
The Bull with the five Legs , Win ; and the great Hog .
Now you ha' begun with Pig , you may long for any
thing , Win , and so for my Motion , Win .
But we sha' not eat o ' the Bull and the Hog ,
John ; how shall I long then ?
O yes , Win : you may long to see , as well as to
taste , Win : How did the Pothecary 's Wife , Win , that
long 'd to see the Anatomy , Win ?
or the Lady , Win , that
desir 'd to spit i' the great Lawyer 's Mouth , after an elo-
quent Pleading ?
I assure you , they long 'd , Win ; good
Win , go in , and long .
I think we are rid of our new Customer , Bro-
ther Leather-head , we shall hear no more of him .
All the better ; let 's pack up all , and be gone ,
before he find us .
Stay a little , yonder comes a Company ; it may
be we may take some more Money .
Sir , I will take your Counsel , and cut my Hair ,
and leave Vapours : I see , that Tabacco , and Bottle-ale ,
and Pig , and Whit , and very Ursla her self , is all Vanity .
Only Pig was not comprehended in my Admo-
nition , the rest were : For long Hair , it is an Ensign of
Pride , a Banner ; and the World is full of those Banners ,
very full of Banners .
And Bottle-ale is a Drink of Sa -
tan 's , a Diet-drink of Satan 's , devised to puff us up , and
make us swell in this latter Age of Vanity ; as the Smoke
of Tabacco , to keep us in Mist and Error : But the flesh -
ly Woman ( which you call Ursla ) is above all to be
avoided , having the Marks upon her of the three Ene -
mies of Man ; the World , as being in the Fair ; the De-
vil , as being in the Fire ; and the Flesh , as being her self .
Brother Zeal-of-the-land ! what shall we do ?
My
Daughter Win-the-fight is fall 'n into her Fit of Longing
For more Pig ?
There is no more , is there ?
To see some Sights i' the Fair .
Sister , let her fly the impurity of the place swift-
ly , lest she partake of the Pitch thereof .
Thou art the
Seat of the Beast , O Smithfield , and I will leave thee .
Idolatry peepeth out on every side of thee .
An excellent right Hypocrite ! Now his Belly is
full , he falls a railing and kicking , the Jade .
A very
good Vapour ! I 'll in , and joy Ursla , with telling how
her Pig works ; two and a half he eat to his Share ; and
he has drunk a Pail-full .
He eats with his Eyes , as well
as his Teeth .
What do you lack , Gentlemen ?
What is't you
buy ?
Rattles , Drums , Babies ? ?
Peace , with thy Apocryphal Wares , thou pro-
fane Publican : thy Bells , thy Dragons , and thy Tobies
Thy Hobby-horse is an Idol , a very Idol , a fierce
and rank Idol : and thou , the Nebuchadnezzar , the proud
Nebuchadnezzar of the Fair , that set 'st it up , for Chil-
dren to fall down to , and worship .
Cry you mercy , Sir ; will you buy a Fiddle to
fill up your noise ?
Look , Win , do , look a Gods name , and save your
Here be fine Sights .
I , Child , so you hate 'em , as our Brother Zeal
does , you may look on 'em .
Or what do you say to a Drum , Sir ?
It is the broken Belly of the Beast , and thy Bel-
lows there are his Lungs , and these Pipes are his Throat ,
those Feathers are of his Tail , and thy Rattles the gnash -
ing of his Teeth .
And what 's my Gingerbread , I pray you ?
The Provender that pricks him up .
Hence with
thy basket of Popery , thy Nest of Images , and whole
Legend of Ginger-work .
Sir , if you be not quiet the quicklier , I 'll ha' you
clapp 'd fairly by the Heels , for disturbing the Fair .
The Sin of the Fair provokes me , I cannot be
Good brother Zeal !
Sir , I 'll make you silent , believe it .
I'ld give a Shilling you could , i' faith , Friend .
Sir , give me your Shilling , I 'll give you my Shop ,

mean time .
A match , i' faith ; but do it quickly then .

cannot sell a Whistle for him in tune .
Stop his noise
Thou canst not ; 'tis a sanctified noise .
I will
make a loud and most strong noise , till I have daunted
the profane Enemy .
And for this Cause ?
Sir , here 's no Man afraid of you , or your Cause .
You shall swear it i' the Stocks , Sir .
I will thrust my self into the Stocks , upon the
Pikes of the Land .
Carry him away .
What do you mean , wicked Men ?
Let them alone , I fear them not .
Was not this Shilling well ventur 'd , Win , for our
Liberty ?
Now we may go play , and see over the Fair ,
where we list our selves ; my Mother is gone after him ,
and let her e 'en go , and lose us .
Yes , John ; but I know not what to do .
For what , VVin ?
For a thing I am asham 'd to tell you , i' faith ;
and 'tis too far to go home .
I pray thee be not asham 'd , VVin .
Come , i'
faith , thou shalt not be asham 'd : Is it any thing about
the Hobby-horse Man ?
an't be , speak freely .
Hang him , base Bobchin , I scorn him ; no , I
have very great , what sha' call 'um , John .
O ! Is that all , VVin ?
We 'll go back to Captain
Jordan , to the Pig-womans , VVin , he 'll help us , or she ,
with a Dripping-pan , or an old Kettle , or something .
The poor greasie Soul loves you , VVin ; and after we 'll
visit the Fair all over , VVin , and see my Puppet-play ,
VVin ; you know it 's a fine matter , VVin .
Let 's away ; I counsel 'd you to pack up afore ,
A pox of his Bedlam Purity .
He has spol 'd half
my
my Ware : But the best is , we lose nothing , if we miss
our first Merchant .
It shall be hard for him to find , or know us , when
we are translated , Jone .
MY Masters , I do make no doubt but you are
What then , Sir ?
And the King 's loving , and obedient Subjects .
Obedient , Friend ?
Take heed what you speak , I
advise you ; Oliver Bristle advises you .
His loving Sub -
jects , we grant you ; but not his obedient , at this time ,
by your leave ; we know our selves a little better than
so ; we are to command , Sir , and such as you are to be
Here 's one of his Obedient Subjects , going
to the Stocks ; and we 'll make you such another , if you
You are all wise enough i' your Places , I know .
If you know it , Sir , why do you bring it in que -
stion ?
I question nothing , pardon me .
I do only hope
you have Warrant for what you do , and so quit you ,
and so multiply you .
What 's he ?
Bring him up to the Stocks there .
Why bring you him not up ?
If you have Justice Overdo 's War-
rant , 'tis well ; you are safe ; that is the
Warrant of Warrants .
I 'll not give this Button for any
Man 's Warrant else .
Like enough , Sir ; but let me tell you , an' you
play away your Buttons thus , you will want 'em e 'er
night , for any store I see about you ; you might keep
'em , and save Pins , I wuss .
What should he be , that doth so esteem and ad-
vance my Warrant ?
He seems a sober and discreet Per-
son ! It is a comfort to a good Conscience , to be fol-
low 'd with a good Fame in his Sufferings .
The World
will have a pretty taste by this , how I can bear Adver-
sity ; and it will beget a kind of Reverence toward me ,
hereafter , even from mine Enemies , when they shall see ,
I carry my Calamity nobly , and that it doth neither
break me , nor bend me .
Come , Sir , here 's a place for you to preach in .
Will you put in your Leg ?
That I will , chearfully .
O' my conscience , a Seminary ! he kisses the
Well , my Masters , I 'll leave him with you ; now
I see him bestow 'd , I 'll go look for my Goods , and
You may , Sir , I warrant you : Where 's the t 'o -
ther Bawler ?
Fetch him too , you shall find 'em both fast
In the midst of this Tumult , I will yet be the
Author of mine own Rest , and not minding their Fury ,
sit in the Stocks , in that calm as shall be able to trouble
a Triumph .
Do you assure me upon your
words ?
May I undertake for you , if I
be ask 'd the Question , that you have this Warrant ?
What 's this Fellow , for God 's sake ?
Do but shew me Adam Overdoo , and I am satis -
He is a Fellow that is distracted , they say ; one
Trouble-all : He was an Officer in the Court of Pie-pow-
ders here , last year , and put out of his Place by Justice
Ha !
Upon which , he took an idle Conceit , and 's run
mad upon't : So that ever since , he will do nothing , but
by Justice Overdo 's Warrant ; he will not eat a Crust ,
nor drink a little , nor make him in his Apparel ready .
His Wife , Sirreverence , cannot get him make his Water ,
or shift his Shirt , without his Warrant .
If this be true , this is my greatest Disaster ! How
am I bound to satisfie this poor Man , that is of so good
a nature to me , out of his Wits ! where there is no room
left for dissembling .
If you cannot shew me Adam Over-
doo , I am in doubt of you : I am afraid
you cannot answer it .
Before me , Neighbour Bristle , ( and now I think
on't better ) Justice Overdoo is a very parantory Person .
O , are you advis 'd of that ?
and a severe Justicer ,
by your leave .
Do I hear ill o ' that side too ?
He will sit as upright o ' the Bench , an' you mark
him , as a Candle i' the Socket , and give Light to the
whole Court in every Business .
But he will burn blue , and swell like a Bile
( God bless us ) an' he be angry .
I , and he will be angry too , when his list , that 's
more ; and when he is angry , be it right or wrong , he
has the Law on 's side ever .
I mark that too .
I will be more tender hereafter .
I see Compas -
sion may become a Justice , though it be a Weakness , I
confess , and nearer a Vice than a Vertue .
Well , take him out o ' the Stocks again ; we 'll
go a sure way to work , we 'll ha' the Ace of Hearts of
our side , if we can .
Come , bring him away to his Fellow there .
Ma -
ster Busy , we shall rule your Legs , I hope , though we can-
not rule your Tongue .
No, Minister of Darkness , no ; thou canst not
rule my Tongue ; my Tongue it is mine own , and with it
I will both knock , and mock down your Bartholmew -
abominations , till you be made a Hissing to the neigh -
bour Parishes round about .
Let him alone , we have devis 'd better upon't .
And shall he not into the Stocks then ?
No, Mistris , we 'll have 'em both to Justice Over-
do , and let him do over 'em as is fitting .
Then I , and
my Gossip Haggis , and my Beadle Pocher are discharg 'd .
O , I thank you , blessed , honest Men !
Nay , never thank us ; but thank this Mad-man
that comes here ; he put it in our Heads .
Is he mad ?
Now Heaven increase his Madness ,
and bless it , and thank it : Sir , your poor Hand-maid
thanks you .
Have you a Warrant ?
An' you have a Warrant ,
shew it .
Yes , I have a Warrant out of the Word , to give
thanks for removing any Scorn intended to the Brethren .
It is Justice Overdo 's Warrant that I look for ; if
you have not that , keep your word , I 'll keep mine .
Quit
ye , and multiply ye .
VVhither go you ?
where 's your VVarrant ?
VVarrant ! for what , Sir ?
For what you go about , you know how fit it is ;
an' you have no VVarrant , bless you , I 'll pray for you ,
that 's all I can do .
VVhat means he ?
A Mad-man that haunts the Fair ; do you not
know him ?
It 's marvel he has not more Followers after
his ragged Heels .
Beshrew him , he startled me : I thought he had
known
known of our Plot .
Guilt 's a terrible thing ! Ha' you
prepar 'd the Costard-monger ?
Yes , and agreed for his Basket of Pears ; he is at
the Corner here , ready .
And your Prise , he comes down
sailing that way all alone , without his Protector ; he is
rid of him , it seems .
I , I know ; I should ha' follow 'd his Protector-
ship , for a Feat I am to do upon him : But this offer 'd it
self so i' the way , I could not let it scape : Here he
comes , whistle ; be this Sport call 'd , Dorring the Dottrel .
Wh , wh , wh , wh , &c .
By this Light , I cannot find my Gingerbread
Wife , nor my Hobbyhorse Man , in all the Fair now , to
ha' my Money again : And I do not know the way out
on't , to go home for more .
Do you hear , Friend , you
that whistle ?
what Tune is that you whistle ?
A new Tune , I am practising , Sir .
Dost thou know where I dwell , I pray thee ?
Nay , on with thy Tune ; I ha' no such haste for an An-
swer : I 'll practise with thee .
Buy any Pears , very fine Pears , Pears fine .
and he falls with his Basket .
Gods so ! a muss , a muss , a muss , a muss .
Good Gentleman , my Ware , my Ware ; I am a
poor Man .
Good Sir , my Ware .
Let me hold your Sword , Sir , it troubles you .
Do , and my Cloke , an' thou wilt , and my Hat
away with his things .
A delicate great Boy ! Me thinks he out-scram -
bles 'em all .
I cannot perswade my self , but he goes to
Grammar-school yet , and plays the Treuant to day .
Would he had another Purse to cut , Zekiel .
Purse ! A Man might cut out his Kidneys , I
think , and he never feel 'em , he is so earnest at the
His Soul is half way out on 's Body , at the Game .
Away , Nightingale ; that way .
I think I am furnish 'd for Cattern-pears , for one
Under-meal : Gi' me my Cloak .
Good Gentleman , give me my Ware .
Where 's the Fellow I ga' my Cloak to ?
My
Cloak and my Hat ?
Ha ! Gods 'lid , is he gone ?
Thieves ,
Thieves ; help me to cry , Gentlemen .
Away , Costard-monger , come to us to Ursla 's .
Talk of him to have a Soul ! ' Heart , if he have any
more than a thing given him in stead of Salt , only to
keep him from stinking , I 'll be hang 'd afore my time ,
presently : Where should it be trow ?
in his Blood ?
He
has not so much to 'ard it in his whole Body , as will
maintain a good Flea : And if he takes this course , he
will not ha' so much Land left , as to rear a Calf , with -
in this Twelve-month .
Was there ever green Plover so
pull 'd ! That his little Overseer had been here now , and
been but tall enough to see him steal Pears , in exchange
for his Bever-hat and his Cloke thus ! I must go find him
out next , for his Black Box , and his Patent ( it seems )
he has of his Place ; which I think the Gentleman
would have a Reversion of , that spoke to me for it so
He comes
Would I might lose my Doublet ,
and Hose too , as I am an honest Man , and
never stir , if I think there be any thing
but thieving and cozning i' this whole Fair .
Barthomew
Fair , quoth he ; an' ever any Bartholmew had that luck
in't that I have had , I 'll be Martyr 'd for him , and in
Throws a -
way his
Smithfield too .
I ha' paid for my Pears ,
a rot on 'em , I 'll keep 'em no longer ; you
were Choak-pears to me : I had been bet-
ter ha' gone to Mum-chance for you , I
Me thinks the Fair should not have
us 'd me thus , and 'twere but for my Names-sake ; I
would not ha' us 'd a Dog o ' the Name so .
O , Numps
will triumph now ! Friend , do you know who I am ?
or where I lie ?
I do not my self , I 'll be sworn .
Do but
carry me home , and I 'll please thee ; I ha' Money enough
I ha' lost my self , and my Cloke , and my Hat ,
and my fine Sword , and my Sister , and Numps , and Mi-
stris Grace , ( a Gentlewoman that I should ha' married )
and a Cut-work Handkercher she ga' me , and two Pur-
ses , to day ; and my Bargain o ' Hobby-horses and Gin-
gerbread , which grieves me worst of all .
By whose Warrant , Sir , have you done all this ?
Warrant ?
Thou art a wise Fellow indeed ; as if
a Man need a VVarrant to lose any thing with !
Yes , Justice Overdoo 's VVarrant , a Man may get
and lose with , I 'll stand to't .
Justice Overdoo ?
Dost thou know him ?
I lie
there ; he is my Brother-in-Law , he married my Sister :
Pray thee shew me the way ; dost thou know the House ?
Sir , shew me your VVarrant ; I know nothing
without a VVarrant , pardon me .
Why , I warrant thee ; come along : thou shalt
see I have wrought Pillows there , and Cambrick Sheets ,
and Sweet-bags too .
Pray thee guide me to the House .
Sir , I 'll tell you ; go you thither your self first
alone , tell your worshipful Brother your Mind , and but
bring me three Lines of his Hand , or his Clerks , with
Adam Overdoo underneath ; here I 'll stay you , I 'll obey
you , and I 'll guide you presently .
' Slid , this is an Ass , I ha' found him ; Pox upon
me , what do I talking to such a dull Fool ?
Farewel ,
you are a very Coxcomb , do you hear ?
I think I am ; if Justice Overdoo sign to it , I am ,
and so we are all : he 'll quit us all , multiply us all .
GEntlemen , this is no way that you take : you do
but breed one another trouble and offence , and
give me no contentment at all .
I am no she that affects
to be quarrel 'd for , or have my Name or Fortune made
the Question of Mens Swords .
' Slood , we love you .
If you both love me , as you pretend , your own
Reason will tell you , but one can enjoy me : and to that
Point there leads a directer Line , than by my Infamy ,
which must follow , if you fight .
' Tis true , I have pro-
fest it to you ingenuously , that rather than to be yoak 'd
with this Bridegroom is appointed me , I would take up
any Husband almost upon any trust .
Though Subtilty
would say to me , ( I know ) he is a Fool , and has an
Estate , and I might govern him , and enjoy a Friend
But these are not my Aims ; I must have a Hus -
band I must love , or I cannot live with him .
I shall ill
make one of these Politick Wives .
Why , if you can like either of us , Lady , say ,
which is he , and the other shall swear instantly to desist .
Content , I accord to that willingly .
Sure you think me a Woman of an extream le -
vity , Gentlemen , or a strange fansie , that ( meeting you
by chance in such a place as this , both at one instant ,
and not yet of two hours acquaintance , neither of you
deserving afore the other of me ) I should so forsake my
Modesty ( though I might affect one more particularly )
as to say , This is he , and name him .
Why , wherefore should you not ?
What should
hinder you ?
If you would not give it to my Modesty , allow
it ye to my Wit ; give me so much of Woman , and
Cunning , as not to betray my self impertinently .
How
can I judge of you , so far as to a Choice , without know -
ing
ing you more ?
You are both equal , and alike to me ,
yet ; and so indifferently affected by me , as each of you
might be the Man , if the other were away .
For you
are reasonable Creatures , you have Understanding and
Discourse ; and if Fate send me an understanding Hus -
band , I have no fear at all , but mine own Manners shall
make him a good one .
Would I were put forth to making for you then .
It may be you are , you know not what 's toward
you : will you consent to a Motion of mine , Gentlemen ?
Whatever it be , we 'll presume reasonableness ,
coming from you .
And fitness too .
I saw one of you buy a pair of Tables e 'en now .
Yes , here they be , and maiden ones too , un-
written in .
The fitter for what they may be employ 'd in .
You shall write either of you here a Word , or a Name ,
what you like best ; but of two or three Syllables at
most : and the next Person that comes this way ( be-
cause Destiny has a high hand in Business of this nature )
I 'll demand , which of the two Words he or she doth
approve ; and according to that Sentence , fix my Reso-
lution and Affection , without change .
Agreed ; my Word is conceived already .
And mine shall not be long creating after .
But you shall promise , Gentlemen , not to be cu-
rious to know which of you it is , taken ; but give me
leave to conceal that , till you have brought me either
home , or where I may safely tender my self .
Why that 's but equal .
We are pleas 'd .
Because I will bind both your Endeavours to
work together friendly and jointly each to the others
Fortune , and have my self fitted with some Means , to
make him that is forsaken , a part of amends .
These Conditions are very courteous .
Well ,
my Word is out of the Arcadia then , Argalus .
And mine out of the Play , Palemon .
Have you any Warrant for this , Gentlemen ?
Ha !
There must be a Warrant had , believe it .
For what ?
For whatsoever it is , any thing indeed , no mat-
ter what .
' Slight , here 's a fine ragged Prophet dropt down
i' the nick !
Heaven quit you , Gentlemen .
Nay , stay a little : Good Lady , put him to the
You are content then ?
Yes , yes .
Sir , here are two Names written ?
Is Justice Overdoo one ?
How , Sir ?
I pray you read 'em to your self ; it
is for a Wager between these Gentlemen : and with a
stroke , or any difference , mark which you approve best .
They may be both worshipful Names , for ought
I know , Mistris ; but Adam Overdoo had been worth
three of 'em , I assure you , in this place , that 's in plain
This Man amazes me ! I pray you , like one of
'em , Sir .
I do like him there , that has the best Warrant ,
Mistris , to save your longing , and ( multiply him ) it
may be this .
But I am still for Justice Overdoo , that 's my
Conscience ; and quit you .
Is't done , Lady ?
I , and strangely , as ever I saw ! What Fellow is
this , trow ?
No matter what ; a Fortune-teller , we ha' made
Which is't , which is't ?
Nay , did you not promise not to enquire ?
' Slid , I forgot that , pray you pardon me .
Look ,
here 's our Mercury come : The Licence arrives i' the
finest time too ! ' Tis but scraping out Cokes his Name ,
and 'tis done .
How now , Lime-twig ?
hast thou touch 'd ?
Not yet , Sir ; except you would go with me , and
see 't , it 's not worth speaking on .
with Vapours ; they ha' got in a Northern Clothier ,
and one Puppy , a Western Man , that 's come to wrastle
before my Lord Mayor anon , and Captain VVhit , and
one Val Cutting , that helps Captain Jordan to roar , a
circling Boy ; with whom your Numps is so taken , that
you may strip him of his Clothes , if you will .
I 'll un-
dertake to geld him for you , if you had but a Surgeon
ready to sear him .
And Mistris Justice there , is the
goodest Woman ! she does so love 'em all over , in terms
of Justice , and the Style of Authority , with her Hood
upright ?
that I beseech you come away Gentlemen ,
and see 't .
' Slight , I would not lose it for the Fair ; what 'll
you do , Ned ?
Why , stay here about for you : Mistris VVel-
born must not be seen .
Do so , and find out a Priest i' the mean time ;
I 'll bring the Licence .
Lead , which way is't ?
Here , Sir , you are o ' the back-side o ' the Booth
already ; you may hear the Noise .
WHit , bid Val Cutting continue the Vapours for a
lift , VVhit , for a lift .
I 'll ne mare , I 'll ne mare ; the Eale 's too meeghty .
How now ! my Galloway Nag the Staggers ! ha !
VVhit , gi' him a Slit i' the Forehead .
Chear up , Man ;
a Needle and Thred , to stitch his Ears .
I'ld cure him
now , an I had it , with a little Butter and Garlick , Long
Pepper and Grains .
Where 's my Horn ?
I 'll gi' him a
Mash presently , shall take away this Dizziness .
Why , where are you , Zurs ?
Do you vlinch , and
leave us i' the Zuds now ?
I 'll ne mare , I'is e 'en as vull as a Paipers Bag , by
my troth , I.
Do my Northern Cloth zhrink i' the wetting ?

Why , well said , old Flea-bitten ; thou'lt never
tire , I see .
No, Sir ; but he may tire , if it please him .
VVho told dee sho ?
that he vuld never teer ,
Man ?
No matter who told him so , so long as he knows .
Nay , I know nothing , Sir , pardon me there .
They are at it still , Sir ; this they call Vapours .
He shall not pardon dee , Captain ; dou shalt
not be pardo n 'd .
Pre 'dee shweet heart do not pardon him .
' Slight , I 'll pardon him , an' I list , whosoever says
nay to't .
VVhere 's Numps ?
I miss him .
is Nonsense .
Every Man to oppose the last Man
that spoke , whether it concern 'd him , or no .
VVhy , I say nay to't .
O , there he is .
To what do you say nay , Sir ?
To any rhing , whatsoever it is , so long as I do
not like it .
Pardon me , little Man , dou musht like it a little .
No, he must not like it at all , Sir ; there you are
i' the wrong .
I tink I be ; he musht not like it , indeed .
Nay ,
Nay , then he both must , and will like it , Sir ,
for all you .
If he have reason , he may like it , Sir .
By no meansh Captain , upon reason , he may
like nothing upon reason .
I have no reason , nor I will hear of no reason ,
nor I will look for no reason , and he is an Ass , that ei-
ther knows any , or looks for't from me .
in some sense you may have reason , Sir .
I , in some sense , I care not if I grant you .
Pardon me , thou ougsht to grant him nothing ,
in no shensh , if dou do love dy shelf , angry Man .
Why then , I do grant him nothing ; and I
have no sense .
' Tis true , thou hast no sense indeed .
' Slid , but I have sense , now I think on't better ,
and I will grant him any thing , do you see ?
He is i' the right , and do 's utter a sufficient Va -
Nay , it is no sufficient Vapour , neither , I deny
Then it is a sweet Vapour .
It may be a sweet Vapour .
Nay , it is no sweet Vapour neither , Sir , it stinks ,
and I 'll stand to't .
Yes , I tink it dosh shtink , Captain .
All Vapour

Nay , then it do 's not stink , Sir , and it shall not
By your leave , it may , Sir .
I , by my leave it may stink , I know that .
Pardon me , thou knowesht nothing , it cannot

How can it not ?
Nay , never question him , for he is i' the right .
Yesh , I am i' de right , I confesh it , so ish de
little Man too .
I 'll have nothing confest , that concerns me .
Iam not i' the right , nor never was i' the right , nor ne -
ver will be i' the right , while I am in my right
Mind , why here 's no Man minds you , Sir , nor
any thing else .
Vriend , will you mind this that we do ;
Call you this Vapours ?
this is such belching of
quarrel , as I never heard .
Will you mind your busi-
ness , Sir ?
You shall see , Sir .
I 'll ne maire , my waimb warkes too mickle with
this auready .
Will you take that , Master Waspe , that no body
should mind you ?
Why ?
what ha' you to do ?
is't any matter to
you ?
No, but methinks you should not be unminded ,
Nor , I wu ' not be , now I think on't , do
you hear , new acquaintance ?
do 's no Man mind me ,
say you ?
Yes , Sir , every Man here minds you , but how ?
Nay , I care as little how as you do ; that was not
my question .
No, noting was ty question , tou art a learned
Man , and I am a valiant Man , i'faith la , tou shalt speak
for me , and I vill fight for tee .
Fight for him , Whit ?
A gross Vapour , he can
fight for himself .
It may be I can , but it may be , I wu ' not ,
how then ?
Why , then you may chuse .
Why , and I 'll chuse whether I 'll chuse or
I think you may , and 'tis true ; and I allow it
for a resolute Vapour .
Nay then , I do think you do not think , and it
is no resolute Vapour ,
Yes , in some sort he may allow you .
In no sort , Sir , pardon me , I can allow him no-
You mistake the Vapour .
He mistakes nothing , Sir , in no sort .
Yes , I pre dee now , let him mistake .
A turd i' your Teeth , never pre dee me , for I
will have nothing mistaken .
Turd , ha turd ?
a noisome Vapour , strike Whit .
Why , Gentlemen , why Gentlemen , I charge
you upon my Authority , conserve the Peace .
In the
King 's name , and my Husbands , put up your Weapons ,
I shall be driven to commit you my self , else .
Ha , ha , ha .
Why do you laugh , Sir ?
Sir , you 'll allow me my Christian liberty .
Imay laugh , I hope .
In some sort you may , and in some sort you may
not , Sir .
Nay in some sort , Sir , he may neither laugh , nor
hope in this company .
Yes , then he may both laugh , and hope in any
sort , an't please him .
Faith , and I will then , for it doth please me ex -
No exceeding neither , Sir .
No, that Vapour is too lofty .
Gentlemen , I do not play well at your Game
of Vapours , I am not very good at it , but ?
Do you hear , Sir ?
I would speak with you in
Circle ?
In Circle , Sir ?
what would you with me in
Circle ?
Can you lend me a Piece , a Jacobus ?
in Circle ?
' Slid , your Circle will prove more costly than
your Vapours , then .
Sir , no , I lend you none .
Your Beard 's not well turn 'd up , Sir .
How Raskal ?

I 'll break Circle with you .
Gentlemen , Gentlemen !

What mean you ?

lion , against you ?

hood , for a Riot , upon my Justice-hood , if you per-
Upon your Justice-hood ?
Marry shite o'your
Hood , you 'll commit ?
Spoke like a true Justice of
Peace 's Wife , indeed , and a fine female Lawyer ! turd
i' your Teeth for a fee , now .
Why , Numps , in Master Overdoo 's name , I
charge you .
Good Mistris Underdoo hold your Tongue .
Alas ! poor Numps .
Alas ! and why alas from you , I beseech you ?
or why poor Numps , goody Rich ?
am I come to be pit-
tied by your tuft Taffata now ?
why Mistris , I knew
Adam the Clerk , your Husband , when he was Adam
Scrivener , and writ for two Pence a Sheet , as high as
he bears his Head now , or you your Hood , Dame .
What
are you , Sir ?
We be Men , and no Infidels ; what is the mat-
ter , here , and the noises ?
can you tell ?
Heart , what ha' you to do ?
cannot a Man
quarrel in quietness ?
but he must be put out on't by
you ?
what are you ?
Why , we be his Majesties Watch , Sir .
Watch ?

A body would think , and you watch 'd well a
nights , you should be contented to sleep at this time a
H h h day .
Get you to your Fleas and your Flock-beds , you
Rogues , your Kennels , and lie down close .
Down ?
yes , we will down , I warrant you , down
with him in his Majesties name , down , down with him ,
and carry him away to the Pidgeon-holes .
I thank you honest Friends , in the behalf o ' the

band , not to suspect .
Your prying Cat-eyed-Citizen is
an abominable Vapour .
Lord , what a Fool have I been !

Nor any one Man from another , but i' the dark .

A mischief on you , they are such as you are , that
undo us , and take our Trade from us , with your Tuft-
taffata Hanches .
How now Alice !
The poor common Whores can ha' no Traffick ,
for the privy rich ones ; your Caps and Hoods of Vel-
vet , call away our Customers , and lick the Fat from us .
Peace you foul ramping Jade , you ? ?
Od 's foot , you Bawd in greace , are you talking ?
Why ,
Why , Alice , I say .
Thou Sow of Smithfield , thou .
Thou Tripe of Turnbull .
Cat-a-mountain Vapours ! ha !
You know where you were taw 'd lately , both

Green Gowns , Crimson -
Petticoats , Green-Women ! my Lord Mayors Green Wo -
men ! Guests o ' the Game , true bred .
I 'll provide you
a Coach , to take the Air , in .
But do you think you can get one ?
O , they are as common as Wheelbarrows ,
where there are great Dunghils .
Every Pettifoggers
Wife , has 'em , for first he buys a Coach , that he may
marry , and then he marries that he may be made Cuc -
kold in't : For if their Wives ride not to their Cuckold -
ing , they do 'em no credit .
Hide , and be hidden ; ride ,
and be ridden , says the Vapour of experience .
BY what Warrant do 's it say so ?
Ha ! mad Child o ' the Pye-pouldres , art thou
there ?
fill us a fresh Kan , Urs , we may drink together .
I may not drink without a Warrant , Captain .
' Slood , thou 'll not stale without a Warrant ,
Whit , Give me Pen , Ink and Paper .
I 'll draw
him a Warrant presently .
It must be Justice Overdoo 's ?
I know , Man , Fetch the Drink , Whit .

O , as brief as can be , here 'tis already .
Adam
Why , now , I 'll pledge you , Captain .
Drink it off .
I 'll come to thee , anon , again .
Well , Sir . You are now discharg 'd : beware of
being spi 'd hereafter .
Sir , will it please you , enter in here , at Ursla 's ;
and take part of a Silken Gown , a Velvet Petticoat , or a
wrought Smock ; I am promis 'd such : and I can spare
any Gentleman a moiety .
Keep it for your Companions in beastliness , I
am none of 'em , Sir . If I had not already forgiven you
a greater trespass , or thought you yet worth my beating ,
I would instruct your manners , to whom you made your
But go your ways , talk not to me , the Hangman
is only fit to discourse with you ; the hand of Beadle is
too merciful a punishment for your Trade of life .
Iam sorry I employ 'd this Fellow ; for he thinks me such :
Fascinus quos inquinat , ?quat .
But , it was for sport .
And
would I make it serious , the getting of this License is
nothing to me , without other circumstances concur .
I do think how impertinently I labour , if the word be
not mine , that the ragged Fellow mark 'd : And what
advantage I have given Ned Win-wife in this time now ,
of working her , though it be mine .
He 'll go near to
form to her what a debauch 'd Raskal I am , and fright
her out of all good conceit of me : I should do so by
him , I am sure , if I had the opportunity .
But my hope
is in her temper , yet ; and it must needs be next to de-
spair , that is grounded on any part of a Womans dis -
I would give by my troth , now , all I could spare
( to my Cloathes , and my Sword ) to meet my tatter 'd
Sooth-sayer again , who was my judge i' the question , to
know certainly whose word he has damn 'd or sav 'd .
For , till then , I live but under a Reprieve .
I must seek
Enter Wasp with the Officers .
Who be these ?
Sir , you are a welsh Cuckold , and a prating
Runt , and no Constable .
You say very well .
Come put in his Leg in the
middle Roundel , and let him hole there .
You stink of Leeks , Metheglyn , and Cheese .
You Rogue .
Why , what is that to you , if you sit sweetly in
the Stocks in the mean time ?
if you have a mind to
stink too , your Breeches sit close enough to your bum .
Sit you merry , Sir .
How now , Numps ?
It is no matter , how ; pray you look off .
Nay , I 'll not offend you , Numps .
I thought you
had sat there to be seen .
And to be sold , did you not ?
pray you mind
your business , an' you have any .
Cry you mercy , Numps .
Do 's your Leg lie high
enough ?
How now , Neighbour Haggise , what says Justice
Overdoo 's Worship to the other offenders ?
Why , he says just nothing , what should he say ?
Or where should he say ?
He is not to be found , Man .
He ha' not been seen i' the Fair , here , all this live-long
day , never since seven a Clock i' the Morning .
His
Clerks know not what to think on't .
There is no Court
of Pie-poulders yet .
Here they be return 'd .
What shall be done with 'em , then ?
in your dis -
cretion ?
I think we were best put 'em in the Stocks in
discretion ( there they will be safe in discretion ) for
the valour of an hour , or such a thing , till his Worship
It is but a hole matter if we do , Neighbour Hag-
gise , come , Sir , here is company for you , heave up the
on his Hand , and slips it in for his Leg .
I shall put a trick upon your welsh diligence ,
Put in your Leg , Sir .
What , Rabby Busy ! is he come ?
I do obey thee , the Lyon may roar , but he
cannot bite .
I am glad to be thus separated from the
Heathen of the Land , and put a part in the Stocks for
the Holy Cause .
What are you , Sir ?
One that rejoyceth in his Affliction , and sit-
teth here to prophesie the Destruction of Fairs and
May-games , Wakes and Whitson-ales , and doth sigh and
groan for the reformation of these abuses .
And do you sigh and groan too , or rejoyce in
your affliction ?
I do not feel it , I do not think of it , it is a thing
without me : Adam , thou art above these battries , these
In te manca ruit fortuna , as thy Friend Ho-
race says ; thou art one , Quem neque pauperies , neque mors ,
neque vincula terrent .
And therefore as another Friend
of thine says , ( I think it be thy Friend Persius ) Non te
qusiveris extra .
What 's here ! a Stoick i' the Stocks ?
the Fool is
turn 'd Philosopher .
Friend , I will leave to communicate my Spirit with
you , if I hear any more of those superstitious Relicks , those
Lists of Latin , the very Rags of Rome , and Patches of Popery .
H h h 2 Was .
Nay ,
Nay , an' you begin to quarrel , Gentlemen , I 'll
leave you .
I ha' paid for quarrelling too lately : look
you , a device , but shifting in a Hand for a Foot .
God
b' w ' you .
Wilt thou then leave thy Brethren in tribula -
tion ?
For this once , Sir .
Thou art a halting Neutral ; stay him there , stop
him , that will not endure the heat of Persecution .
How now , what 's the matter ?
He is fled , he is fled , and dares not sit it out .
What , has he made an escape , which way ?
fol-
low , Neighbour Haggise .
O me ! in the Stocks ! have the wicked pre -
vail 'd ?
Peace religious Sister , it is my Calling , comfort
your self , an extraordinary Calling , and done for my
better standing , my surer standing , hereafter .
By whose Warrant , by whose Warrant , this ?
O , here 's my Man , dropt in , I look 'd for .
Ha !
O good Sir , they have set the faithful here to
be wonder 'd at ; and provided holes for the holy of the
Had they Warrant for it ?
shew 'd they Justice
Overdoo 's Hand ?
if they had no Warrant , they shall an-
swer it .
Sure you did not lock the Stocks sufficiently ,
Neighbour Toby !
No! see if you can lock 'em better .
They are very sufficiently lock 'd , and truly , yet
some thing is in the matter .
True , your Warrant is the matter that is in que -
stion , by what Warrant ?
Mad Man , hold your Peace , I will put you in his
room else , in the very same hole , do you see ?
How ! is he a Mad-man !
Shew me Justice Overdoo 's Warrant , I obey you .
You are a mad Fool , hold your Tongue .
In Justice Overdoo 's name , I drink to you , and
here 's my Warrant .
Alas poor Wretch ! how it earns my Heart for
him !
If he be mad , it is in vain to question him .
I 'll
try though .
Friend , there was a Gentlewoman , shew 'd
you two names , some hour since , Argalus and Palemon ,
to mark in a Book , which of 'em was it you mark 'd ?
I mark no name , but Adam Overdoo , that is the
name of names , he only is the sufficient Magistrate ; and
that name I reverence , shew it me .
This Fellow 's mad indeed : I am further off
now , than afore .
I shall not breath in peace , till I have made him
some amends .
Well , I will make another use of him , is come
in my head : I have a Nest of Beards in my Trunk ; one
something like his .

Sir , I love you , and would be glad to be mad

How ! my Widow in love with a Mad-man ?
Verily , I can be as mad in Spirit as you .
By whose Warrant ?
leave your canting .
Gen-
tlewoman , have I found you ?
( save ye , quit ye , and
multiply ye ) where 's your Book ?
'twas a sufficient name
I mark 'd , let me see 't , be not afraid to shew't me .
What
What would you with it , Sir ?
Mark it again and again at your Service .
Here it is , Sir , this was it you mark 'd .
Palemon ?
fare you well , fare you well .
How , Palemon !
Yes faith , he has discover 'd it to you now , and
therefore 'twere vain to disguise it longer , I am yours ,
Sir , by the benefit of your Fortune .
And you have him Mistris , believe it , that
shall never give you cause to repent her benefit , but
make you rather to think , that in this choice she had both
her Eyes .
I desire to put it to no danger of protesta -
Palemon the word , and Win-wife the Man ?
Good Sir , vouchsafe a Yokefellow in your mad-
ness , shun not one of the sanctified Sisters , that would
draw with you in truth .
Away , you are a Herd of hypocritical proud
Ignorants , rather wild than mad ; Fitter for Woods ,
and the Society of Beasts , than Houses , and the Con-
gregation of Men .
You are the Second part of the
Society of Canters , Out-Laws to Order and Discipline ,
and the only priviledg 'd Church-Robbers of Christen-
Let me alone , Palemon the Word , and Win-wife
the Man ?
I must uncover my self unto him , or I shall ne -
ver enjoy him , for all the Cunning Mens Promises .
Good Sir , hear me , I am worth Six Thousand Pound ,
my Love to you is become my Rack , I 'll tell you all
and the truth , since you hate the Hypocrisie of the par-
ty-coloured Brother-hood .
These seven years I have
been a wilful holy Widow , only to draw Feasts and
Gifts from my intangled Suitors : I am also by Office
an assisting Sister of the Deacons , and a Devourer , in-
stead of a Distributer of the Alms .
I am a special
Maker of Marriages for our decayed Brethren , with our
Rich Widows , for a third part of their Wealth , when
they are married , for the Relief of the poor Elect : as
also our poor handsome young Virgins , with our
wealthy Batchelors , or Widowers ; to make them steal
from their Husbands , when I have confirmed them in
the Faith , and got all put into their Custodies .
And if
I ha' not my Bargain , they may sooner turn a scolding
Drab into a silent Minister , than make me leave pro-
nouncing Reprobation and Damnation unto them .
Our
Elder , Zeal-of-the-land , would have had me , but I know
him to be the Capital Knave of the Land , making him -
self rich , by being made Feoffee in trust to deceased Bre -
thren , and coz'ning their Heirs , by swearing the abso -
lute Gift of their Inheritance .
And thus having eas 'd
my Conscience , and utter 'd my Heart with the Tongue
of my Love : Enjoy all my Deceits together , I beseech
I should not have revealed this to you , but that in
time I think you are mad , and I hope you 'll think me so
too , Sir ?
He considers
with himself
of it .
Stand aside , I 'll answer you pre -
Why should not I marry this Six
Thousand Pound , now I think on't ?
and
a good Trade too that she has beside , ha ?
The t 'other Wench Win-wife is sure of ; there 's no Ex -
pectation for me there ! here I may make my self some
saver , yet , if she continue mad , there 's the Question .
It is Money that I want , why should I not marry the
Money when 'tis offer 'd me ?
I have a Licence and all , it
is but razing out one Name , and putting in another .
There 's no playing with a Man 's Fortune ! I am resolv 'd !
I were truly mad an' I would not ! Well , come your
ways , follow me , an' you will be mad , I 'll shew you a
Warrant !
Most zealously , it is that I zealously desire .
Sir , let me speak with you .
By whose Warrant ?
The Warrant that you tender , and respect so ;
Justice Overdoo 's ! I am the Man , Friend Trouble-all ,
tho thus disguis 'd ( as the careful Magistrate ought ) for
the good of the Republick in the Fair , and the weeding
out of Enormity .
Do you want a House , or Meat , or
Drink , or Clothes ?
Speak whatsoever it is , it shall be
supplied you , what want you ?
Nothing but your Warrant .
My Warrant ?
for what ?
To be gone , Sir .
Nay , I pray thee stay , I am serious , and have not
many words , nor much time to exchange with thee
think what may do thee good .
;
Your Hand and Seal will do me a great deal
of good ; Nothing else in the whole Fair , that I
If it were to any end , thou should 'st have it
Why , it will satisife me , that 's end enough , to
look on ; an' you will not gi' it me , let me go .
Alas ! thou shalt ha' it presently .
I 'll but step
into the Scriveners here by , and bring it .
Do not go
Why , this Mad Man 's shape will prove a very
fortunate one , I think ! Can a Ragged Robe produce
these Effects ?
if this be the wise Justice , and he bring me
his hand , I shall go near to make some use on't .
He is
come already !
Look thee ! here is my Hand and Seal , Adam
Over-doo , if there be any thing to be written above in
this Paper that thou want 'st now , or at any time here -
after , think on't , it is my deed , I deliver it so ; can your
Friend write ?
Her hand for a Witness , and all is well .
With all my heart .
Why should not I ha' the Conscience to make
this a Bond of a Thousand Pound now , or what I would
else ?
Look you , there it is ; and I deliver it as my Deed
Let us now proceed in madness .
Well , my Conscience is much eas 'd ; I ha' done
my part , though it doth him no good , yet Adam hath
offer 'd Satisfaction ! The Sting is removed from hence !
Poor man , he is much alter 'd with his Affliction , it has
brought him low ! Now for my other work , reducing
the Young Man ( I have follow 'd so long in Love ) from
the brink of his Bane , to the Center of Safety .
Here ,
or in some such like vain place , I shall be sure to find him .
I will wait the good time .
what 's here to do ?
Friend , art thou the
Master of the Monuments ?
' Tis a Motion , an't please your Worship .
My phantastical Brother in Law , Master Barthol-
mew Cokes !

A Motion , what 's that ?

Modern History of Hero and Leander , other -
wise called The Touchstone of true Love , with
as true a Trial of Friendship between Damon

Pretty
i' faith , what 's the meaning on't ?
is't an Enterlude ?
or
what is't ?
Yes , Sir , please you come near , we 'll take your
Money within .
Back with these Children ; they do so follow me
up and down .
By your leave , friend .
You must pay , Sir , an' you go in .
Who , I ?
I perceive thou know 'st not me : call

Master Little-wit , how dost thou ?
Master Cokes ! you are exceeding well met :
What , in your Doublet and Hose , without a Cloak or
a Hat ?
I would I might never stir , as I am an honest
man , and by that fire ; I have lost all i'the Fair , and all
my Acquaintance too ; didst thou meet any body that
I know , Master Little-wit ?

Pray thee Master
Little-wit lend me some Money to see the Interlude
I 'll pay thee again , as I am a Gentleman .

have done with me , if you had had me , Feather and all ,
as I was once to day ?
Ha' you none of your pretty
Impudent Boys now , to bring Stools , fill Tabacco ,
fetch Ale , and beg money , as they have at other Houses ?
I , the favouring of this Licentious Quality is the
Consumption of many a Young Gentleman ; a perni-
cious Enormity .
What , do they live in Baskets ?
They do lie in a Basket , Sir , they are o ' the small
These be Players minors indeed .
Do you call
these Players ?
Thy mouth will hold 'em all .
I think one Taylor
would go near to beat all this Company , with a Hand
bound behind him .
I , and eat 'em all too , an' they were in Cake-
I thank you for that , Master Little-wit , a good
Jest ! which is your Burbage now ?
What mean you by that , Sir ?
This is he , that acts young Leander , Sir . He
is extreamly belov 'd of the Womenkind , they do
Dionysius in the Habit of a Scrivener : as you shall see
anon at large .
Well , they are a Civil Company , I like 'em for
that ; they offer not to fleer , nor geer , nor break Jests ,
as the great Players do : And then , there goes not so
much charge to the Feasting of 'em , or making 'em
drunk , as to the other , by reason of their Littleness .
Do they use to play perfect ?
Are they never flu-
ster 'd ?
No, Sir , I thank my Industry and Policy for
it ; they are as well govern 'd a Company , though I
say it ? ?
And here is Young Leander , is as pro-
But do you play it according to the Printed
Book ?
I have read that .
By no means , Sir .
No ?
How then ?
A better way , Sir , that is too Learned and Poe-
tical for our Audience , what , do they know what Helle -
spont is ?
Guilty of true Loves Blood ?
or what Abidos is ?
or the other Sestos height ?
Th' art i' the right , I do not know my self .
No, I have entreated Master Little-wit to take
a little pains to reduce it to a more familiar strain for our
How , I pray thee , good Master Little-wit .
It pleases him to make a matter of it , Sir .
But there is no such matter , I assure you : I have only
made it a little easie , and Modern for the Times , Sir ,
that 's all : As for the Hellespont , I imagine our Thames
here ; and then Leander I make a Dyer 's Son about
Puddle-Wharf ; and Hero a Wench o ' the Bank-side , who
going over one Morning to Old-Fishstreet , Leander
spies her land at Trigs-Stairs , and falls in Love with
her : Now do I introduce Cupid , having Metamor-
phos 'd himself into a Drawer , and he strikes Hero in
love with a Pint of Sherry , and other pretty passages
there are o ' the friendship , that will delight you , Sir ,
and please you of Judgment .
I 'll be sworn they shall : I am in Love with
( Le ' me see ) i' faith , my Fiddle ! and Leander my
Fiddle-stick : Then Damon my Drum ; and Pythias
my Pipe , and the Ghost of Dionysius my Hobby-Horse .
All fitted .
And to them Waspe .
LOok yonder 's your Cokes gotten in among his Play-
fellows ; I thought we could not miss him at such
a Spectacle .
Let him alone , he is so busie he will never
spy us .
Nay , good Sir .
I warrant thee I will not hurt her , Fellow ; what
dost think me uncivil ?
I pray thee be not jealous : I am
toward a Wife .
Well , good Master Lantern , make ready to begin ,
that I may fetch my Wife , and look you be perfect , you
undo me else , i' my Reputation .
I warrant you , Sir , do not you breed too great
an Expectation of it among your Friends : that 's the
only hurter of these things .
No, no , no .
I 'll stay here and see ; pray thee let me see .
How diligent and troublesome he is !
The place becomes him , me thinks .
My ward , Mistris Grace , in the Company of a
stranger ?
I doubt I shall be compell 'd to discover my self
before my time .

Yes , Captain , and Water-works too .
I pree dee take a Care o ' dy shmall Lady

Welcome Gentlemen , welcome Gentlemen .
Predee Mashter o ' de Monshtersh , help a very sick
Lady here to a Chair to shit in .
Presently , Sir .
Good fait now , Ursla 's Ale , and Aqu?-vit ? ish

shleep a little .
Madam , you are very welcome hither .
Yes , and you shall see very good Vapours .
Here is my Care come ! I like to see him in so
good Company ; and yet I wonder that persons of such
Fashion should resort hither !
This is a very private house , Madam .
Will it please your Ladyship sit , Madam ?
Yes , Goodman .
They do so all to be Madam
me , I think they think me a very Lady !
What else Madam ?
Must I put off my Mask to him ?
O , by no means .
How should my Husband know me then ?
Husband ?
an idle Vapour ; he must not know
you , nor you him ; there 's the true Vapour .
Yea , I will observe more of this : is this a Lady ,
friend ?
I , and dat is anoder Lady , shweet heart ; if dou
hasht a mind to 'em , give me Twelve pence from tee ,
and dou shalt have eder-oder on 'em .
I?This will prove my chiefest Enormity : I will
follow this .
Is not this a finer Life , Lady , than to be clogg 'd
with a Husband ?
Yes , a great deal .
When will they begin , trow ?
in the Name o ' the Motion ?
By and by , Madam ; they stay but for Com -
Do you hear , Puppet-Master , these are tedious
Vapours ; when begin you ?
We stay but for Master Lettle-wit , the Au-
thor , who is gone for his Wife ; and we begin pre -
That 's I , that 's I.
That was you , Lady ; but now you are no such
poor thing .
Hang the Author 's Wife , a running Vapour !
here be Ladies will stay for ne 're a Delia o ' 'em all .
But hear me now , here ish one o ' de Ladish a

How now , Friends ?
what 's here to do ?
Two pence a piece , Sir , the best Motion in the
I believe you lie ; if you do , I 'll have my money
again , and beat you .
Numps is come !
Did you see a Master of mine come in here , a
tall Young Squire of Harrow o ' the Hill , Master Barthol-
mew Cokes ?
I think there be such a one within .
Look he be , you were best : but it is very like -
ly : I wonder I found him not at all the rest .
I ha'
been at the Eagle , and the Black Wolf , and the Bull
with the Five Legs , and Two Pizzles : ( He was a
Calf at Uxbridge Fair Two Years agone : ) And at
the Dogs that daunce the Morrice , and the Hair o '
the Taber ; and mist him at all these ! Sure this must
needs be some fine Sight , that holds him so , if it
have him .
Come , come , are you ready now ?
Presently , Sir .
Hoyday , he 's at work in his Doublet and Hose ;
Do you hear , Sir ?
are you imploy 'd , that you are bare
headed , and so busie ?
Hold your peace , Numps ; you ha' been i' the
Stocks , I hear .
Do 's he know that ?
Nay , then the Date of my
Authority is out ; I must think no longer to reign , my
Government is at an end .
He that will correct another
must want fault in himself .
Sententious Numps ! I never heard so much
from him before .
Sure Master Little-wit will not come ; please
you take your place , Sir , we 'll begin .
I pray thee do , mine Ears long to be at it ; and
my Eyes too .
O Numps , i' the Stocks , Numps ?
where 's
your Sword , Numps ?
I pray you intend your Game , Sir , let me
Well then , we are quit for all .
Come , sit down ,
Numps ; I 'll interpret to thee : Did you see Mistris
Grace ?
It 's no matter neither , now I think on't , tell
me anon .
A great deal of Love and Care he ex -
Alas ! would you have him to express more than
he has ?
that were Tyranny .
Peace , ho ; now , now .
Gentiles , that no longer yonr Expectations may wander ,
Which place we 'll make bold with , to call it our Abidus ,
As the Bank-side is our Sestos ; and let it not be deny 'd us .
Now as he is beating , to make the Dye take the fuller ,
Who chances to come by , but Fair Hero , in a Sculler ;
And seeing Leander 's naked Leg , and goodly Calf ,
Cast at him from the Boat a Sheeps Eye and an half .
Now she is landed , and the Sculler come back ,
By and by you shall see what Leander doth lack .
Cole , Cole , Old Cole .
That is the Sculler 's Name , without controle .
Cole , Cole , I say , Cole .
We do hear you .
Old Cole .
Old Cole ?
Is the Dyer turn 'd Collier ?
how do you sell ?
A Pox o'your manners , kiss my hole here , and smell .
Kiss your hole and smell ?
there 's manners indeed .
Why , Cole , I say , Cole .
It 's the Sculler you need .
I , and be hang 'd .
Be hang 'd ; look you yonder .
Old Cole , you must go hang with Master Leander .
Where is he ?
Cole : What Fairest of Fairs ,
Was that Fare that thou landest but now at Trigs-Stairs ?
What was that fellow ?
Pray thee tell me , I scarce
understand 'em .
Leander do 's ask , Sir , what fairest of Fairs ,
Was the Fare he landed but now at Trigs Stairs ?
It is loverly Hero .
Nero ?
No, Hero .
It is Hero .
Of the Bank-side , he saith , to tell you truth , without erring ,
Is come over into Fish-Street , to eat some Fresh Herring .
Leander says no more , but as fast as he can ,
Gets on all his best Clothes , and will after to the Swan .
Most admirable good , is't not ?
Stay , Sculler .
What say you ?
You must stay for Leander ,
And carry him to the Wench .
You Rogue , I am no Pandar .
He says he is no Pandar .
' Tis a fine Language ; I
understand it now .
Are you no Pandar , Goodman Cole ?
Here 's no Man
says you are :
You 'll grow a hot Cole , it seems , pray you stay for your Fare .
Will he come away ?
What do you say ?
I ' de ha' him come away .
Would you ha' Leander come away ?
why 'pray ' Sir ,
You are angry , Goodman Cole ; I believe the Fair Maid
Came over w ' you a' trust : tell us Sculler , are you paid .
Yes Goodman Hogrubber , o ' Pickt-hatch .
How ?
Hogrubber o ' Pickt-hatch ?
I Hogrubber o ' Pickt-hatch .
Take you that .
O , my Head !
Harm watch , harm catch .
Harm watch , harm catch , he says : Very
good i' faith , the Sculler had like to ha' knock 'd you ,
Yes , but that his Fare call 'd him away .
Row apace , row apace , row , row , row , row ,
You are knavishly loaden , Sculler , take heed where
you go .
Knave i' your Face , Goodman Rogue .
Row , row , row , row , row , row .
He said , Knave i' your Face , Friend .
I , Sir , I heard him .
But there 's no talking to
these Water-men , they will ha' the last word .
God 's my life ! I am not allied to the Sculler
yet ; he shall be Dauphin my Boy .
But my Fiddle-stick
do 's fiddle in and out too much : I pray thee speak to
him on't : Tell him , I would have him tarry in my
sight more .
I pray you be content ; you 'll have enough on
him , Sir .
Now , Gentiles , I take it , here is none of you so stupid ,
But that you have heard of a Little God of Love call 'd
VVho out of Kindness to Leander , hearing he but saw her ,
This present day and hour doth turn himself to a Drawer .
And because he would have their first Meeting to be merry ,
He strikes Hero in love to him with a Pint of Sherry .
VVhich he tells her from amorous Leander is sent her ,
VVho after him , into the Room of Hero doth venture .
Leander goes into Mistris Hero 's Room .
A Pint of Sack , score a Pint of Sack i' the
Sack ?
you said but e 'en now it should be Sherry .
Why so it is ; Sherry , Sherry , Sherry .
Sherry , Sherry , Sherry .
By my Troth he makes
me merry .
I must have a Name for Cupid too .
Let
me see , thou might 'st help me now , an' thou would -
est , Numps , at a dead lift ; but thou art dreaming
o ' the Stocks still .
Do not think on't , I have for-
got it ; 'tis but a Nine Days Wonder , Man ; let it not
trouble thee .
I would the Stocks were about your Neck , Sir ;
condition I hung by the Heels in them till the Wonder
were off from you , with all my heart .
Well said , resolute Numps : But hark you friend ,
where is the friendship all this while between my Drum
Damon , and my Pipe Pythias ?
You shall see by and by , Sir .
You think my Hobby-horse is forgotten too ; no ,
I 'll see 'em all enact before I go ; I shall not know which
to love best else .
This Gallant has interrupting Vapours , trouble -
some Vapours ; Whit , puff with him .
No, I pre dee , Captain , let him alone .
He is
a Child i' faith , la' .
Now Gentiles , to the Friends , who in Number are Two ,
and lodg 'd in that Ale-house , in which Fair Hero do 's do .
Damon ( for some kindness done him the last VVeek )
Is come , Fair Hero , in Fish-street , this morning to seek :
Pythias do 's smell the Knavery of the Meeting ,
And now you shall see their true friendly greeting .
You VVhore-masterly Slave , you .
Whore-masterly Slave , you ?
very friendly and
familiar , that .
VVhore-master i' thy Face ,
Thou hast lien with her thy self , I 'll prove 't i' this place .
Damon says Pythias has lien with her himself , he 'll
prove 't in this place .
They are VVhore-masters both , Sir , that 's a plain
You lie , like a Rogue .
Do I lie , like a Rogue ?
A Pimp , and a Scab .
A Pimp , and a Scab ?
I say , between you , you have both but one Drab .
You lie again .
Do I lie again ?
Like a Rogue again .
Like a Rogue again ?
And you are a Pimp again .
And you are Pimp again , he says .
And a Scab again .
And a Scab again , he says .
And I say again , you are both VVhore-masters again .
And you have both but one Drab again .
Dost thou , dost thou , dost thou ?
Lan , VVhat , both at once ?
Down with him , Damon .
Pink his Guts , Pythias .
VVhat , so malicious ?
VVill ye murder me , Masters both , i' my own House ?
Ho! well acted , my Drum ; well acted , my Pipe ,
well acted still .
Well acted , with all my heart .
Hold , hold your Hands .
I , both your Hands , for my sake ! for you ha' both
done well .
Gramercy , pure Pythias .
Gramercy , dear Damon .
Gramercy to you both , my Pipe and my Drum .
Come , now we 'll together to breakfast to Hero .
' Tis well you can now go to breakfast to Hero ,
You have given me my breakfast , with a hone and honero .
How is't friend , ha' they hurt thee ?
O , no!
Between you and I , Sir , we do but make show .
Thus , Gentiles , you perceive , without any denial ,
' Twixt Damon and Pythias here , Friendships true tryal .
Tho hourly they quarrel thus , and roar each with other ,
They fight you no more than do 's Brother with Brother .
But friendly together , at the next Man they meet ,
They let fly their Anger , as here you might see 't .
Well , we have see n't , and thou hast felt it , what -
soever thou sayest .
What 's next ?
what 's next ?
This while young Leander , with fair Hero is drink -
ing ,
and Hero grown drunk , to any mans thinking !
Yet was it not three Pints of Sherry could flaw her ,
till Cupid distinguish 'd like Jonas the Drawer ,
From under his Apron , where his lechery lurks ,
put love in her Sack .
Now mark how it works .
O Leander Leander , my dear my dear Leander ,
I 'll for ever be thy Goose , so thou'lt be my Gander .
Excellently well said , Fiddle , she 'll ever be his
Goose , so he 'll be her Gander : was't not so ?
Yes , Sir , but mark his answer , now .
And sweetest of Geese , before I go to Bed ,
I 'll swim o 're the Thames , my Goose , thee to tread .
Brave ! he will swim o 're the Thames , and tread
his Goose to night , he says .
I , peace , Sir , they 'll be angry , if they hear
you eaves-dropping , now they are setting their match .
But lest the Thames should be dark , my Goose ,
my dear Friend ,
let thy Window be provided of a Candles end .
Fear not , my Gander , I protest , I should handle
my matters very ill , if I had not a whole Candle .
Well then , look to't , and kiss me to Boot .
Now , here come the Friends again , Pythias , and
and under their Clokes , they have of Bacon , a Gammon .
Drawer , fill some Wine here .
How , some Wine there ?
there 's company already , Sir , pray forbear !
' Tis Hero .
Yes , but she will not be taken ,
after Sack , and fresh Herring , with youo Dunmow-bacon .
You lye , it 's Westfabian .
Westphalian you should say .
If you hold not your peace , you are a Coxcomb ,
I would say .
What 's here ?
what 's here ?
kiss , kiss , upon kiss .
I , Wherefore should they not ?
what harm is in this ?
'tis Mistris Hero .
Mistris Hero 's a whore .
Is she a whore ?
keep you quiet , or Sir Knave out of door .
Knave out of door ?
Yes , Knave out of door .
quarrel and fall
together by the
VVhore out of door .
I say , Knave , out of door .
I say , Whore out of door .
Yea , so say I too .
Kiss the whore o ' the Arse .
Now you ha' something to do :
you must kiss her o ' the Arse , she says .
So we will , so we will .
O , my Hanches , O my Hanches , hold , hold .
Stand 'st thou still ?
Leander , where art thou ?
stand 'st thou still like a Sot ,
and not offer 'st to break both their Heads with a Pot ?
See who 's at thine Elbow , there ! Puppet Jonas and Cupid .
Upon 'em Leander , be not so stupid .
You Goat-bearded Slave !
You whore-master Knave .
Thou art a whore-master .
VVhore-masters all .
See , Cupid with a word has tane up the brawl .
These be fine Vapours !
By this good day , they fight bravely ! do they not ,
Numps ?
Yes , they lack 'd but you to their second all this
This tragical encounter , falling out thus to busie us ,
It raises up the Ghost of their Friend Dionysius :
Not like a Monarch , but the Master of a School ,
In a Scriveners furr 'd Gown , which shews he is no Fool .
For therein he hath wit enough to keep himself warm .
O Damon he cries , and Pythias ; what harm ,
Hath poor Dionysius done you in his Grave ,
That after his death you should fall out thus and rave ,
And call amorous Leander whore-master Knave ?
I cannot , I will not , I promise you endure it .
Down with Dagon , down with Dagon : 'tis I ,
will no longer endure your Profanations .
What mean you , Sir ?
I will remove Dagon there , I say , that Idol , that
heathenish Idol , that remains ( as I may say ) a Beam , a
very Beam , not a Beam of the Sun , nor a Beam of the
Moon , nor a Beam of a Ballance , neither a House -
Beam , nor a Weavers Beam , but a Beam in the Eye , in
the Eye of the Brethren ; a very great Beam , an exceed -
ing great Beam ; such as are your Stage-players , Rimers ,
and Morrise-dancers , who have walked hand in hand , in
contempt of the Brethren , and the Cause ; and been born
out by Instruments of no mean Countenance .
Sir , I present nothing but what is licens 'd by
Thou art all License , even Licentiousness it self ,
Shimei !
I have the Master of the Revell 's hand for't , Sir .
The Master of Rebells hand , thou hast Satan 's !
hold thy peace , thy scurrility , shut up thy Mouth , thy
Profession is damnable , and in pleading for it , thou dost
plead for Baal .
I have long opened my Mouth wide ,
and gaped , I have gaped as the Oyster for the Tide , after
thy destruction : but cannot compass it by sute or dis -
pute ; so that I look for a Bickering , ere long , and then
a Battel .
Good Banbury Vapours .
Friend , you 'ld have an ill match on't , if you
bicker with him here , though he be no Man o ' the Fist ,
he has Friends that will go to Cuffs for him .
Numps , will
not you take our side ?
Sir , it shall not need , in my Mind he offers him
a fairer Course , to end it by disputation ! hast thou no-
thing to say for thy self , in defence of thy quality ?
Faith , Sir , I am not well studied in these Con-
troversies , between the Hypocrites and us .
But here 's
one of my Motion , Puppet Dionysius , shall undertake him ,
and I 'll venture the cause on't .
Who ?
my Hobby-horse ?
will he dispute with
him ?
Yes , Sir , and make a Hobby-Ass of him , I hope .
That 's excellent ! indeed he looks like the best
Scholar of 'em all .
Come , Sir , you must be as good as
your word now .
I will not fear to make my Spirit and Gifts
known ! assist me Zeal , fill me , fill me , that is , make
me full .
What a desperate , profane wretch is this !
is there any Ignorance or Impudence like his ?
to call
his zeal to fill him against a Puppet ?
I know no fitter match then a Puppet to commit
with an Hypocrite !
First , I say unto thee Idol , thou hast no Calling .
You lie , I am call 'd Dionysius .
The Motion says , you lye , he is call 'd Dionisius i'
the matter , and to that calling he answers .
I mean no vocation , Idoll , no present lawful Calling .
Is yours a lawful Calling ?
The Motion asketh , if yours be a lawful Calling ?
Yes , mine is of the Spirit .
Then Idol is a lawful Calling .
He says , then Idol is a lawful Calling ! for you
call 'd him Idol , and your Calling is of the Spirit .
I i i Cok .
Well
Well disputed Hobby-horse !
Take not part with the wicked young Gallant .
He neygheth and hinneyeth , all is but hinnying Sophi-
I call him Idol again .
Yet , I say , his Calling , his
Profession is profane , it is profane , Idol .
It is not profane !
It is not profane , he says .
It is profane .
It is not profane .
It is profane .
It is not profane .
Well said , confute him with not , still .
You can-
not bear him down with your base noise , Sir .
Nor he me , with his treble creeking , though he
creek like the Chariot Wheels of Satan ; I am zealous
for the Cause ?
As a Dog for a Bone .
And I say , it is profane , as being the Page of
Pride , and the waiting Woman of Vanity .
Yea ?
what say you to your Tire-women , then ?
Or Feather-makers i' the Fryers , that are o ' your
faction of faith ?
Are not they , with their Perrukes , and their
Puffs , their Fans , and their Huffs , as much Pages of Pride ,
and waiters upon vanity ?
what say you ?
what say you ?
what say you ?
I will not answer for them .
Because you cannot , because you cannot .
Is a Bugle -
maker a lawful Calling ?
or the Confect-makers ?
such
you have there ?
or your French Fashioner ?
you 'd have all
the Sin within your selves , would you not ?
would you not ?
No, Dagon .
VVhat then , Dagonet ?
is a Puppet worse than these ?
Yes , and my main Argument against you , is ,
that you are an abomination : for the Male , among you ,
putteth on the Apparel of the Female , and the Female of
the Male .
You lye , you lye , you lye abominably .
Good , by my Troth , he has given him the lye
It is your old stale Argument against the Players , but
it will not hold against the Puppets ; for we have neither Male
nor Female amongst us .
And that thou may 'st see , if thou
wilt , like a malicious purblind zeal as thou art !
By my faith , there he has answer 'd you , Friend ,
by plain demonstration .
Nay , I 'll prove against e 're a Rabbin of 'em all , that
my standing is as lawful as his ; that I speak by inspiration ,
as well as he ; that I have as little to do with learning as he ;
and do scorn her helps as much as he .
I am confuted , the Cause hath failed me .
Then be converted , be converted .
Be converted , I pray you , and let the Play go
on !
Let it go on .
For I am changed , and will be-
come a beholder with you !
That 's brave i' faith , thou hast carried it away ,
Hobby-horse , on with the Play !
Stay , now do I forbid , I am Adam Overdoo! sit
still , I charge you .
What , my Brother i' Law !
My wise Guardian !
Justice Overdoo!
It is time to take Enormity by the Fore-head ,
and brand it ; for I have discover 'd enough .
Nay , come Mistris Bride ; you must do as
I do , now .
You must be mad with me , in truth .
I have here Justice Overdoo for it .
Peace , good Trouble-all ; come hither , and you
shall trouble none .
I will take the charge of you , and
your Friend too ; you also , young Man shall be my care ,
stand there .
Now , mercy upon me .
Would we were away , VVhit , these are dange -
rous Vapours , best fall off with our Birds for fear o ' the
Stay , is not my name your terror ?
Yesh faith Man , and it ish for tat we would
be gone Man .
O Gentlemen ! did you not see a Wife of mine ?
I ha' lost my little Wife , as I shall be trusted : my little
pretty VVin .
I left her at the great Woman 's House in
trust yonder , the Pig-womans , with Captain Jordan ,
and Captain VVhit , very good Men , and I cannot hear
of her .
Poor Fool , I fear she 's stepp 'd aside .
Mother ,
did you not see VVin ?
If this Grave Matron by your Mother , Sir ,
stand by her , Et digito , compesce labellum , I may perhaps
Spring a Wife for you , anon .
Brother Bartholmew , I
am sadly sorry , to see you so lightly given , and such a
Disciple of enormity , with your grave Governour Hum -
phrey : but stand you both there , in the middle Place ; I
will reprehend you in your Course .
Mistris Grace , let
me rescue you out of the hands of the stranger .
Pardon me , Sir , I am a Kinsman of hers .
Are you so ?
of what name , Sir ?
Winwife , Sir .
Master VVinwife ?
I hope you have won no Wife
of her , Sir . If you have , I will examine the possibili-
ty of it , at fit leisure .
Now , to my Enormities : look
upon me , O London ! and see me , O Smithfield ! The ex -
ample of Justice , and Mirror of Magistrates : the true top
of Formality , and scourge of Enormity .
Hearken un-
to my labours , and but observe my discoveries ; and com-
pare Hercules with me , if thou dar 'st , of old ; or Co-
lumbus , Magellan , or our Country-man Drake of later
times : stand forth you VVeeds of Enormity , and spread .
To Busy ,
To Lantern ,
To the Horse -
Courser , and
Then Captain
Whit , and Mi-
stris Littlewit .
First Rabby Busy , thou superlunatical Hypo-
crite , next , thou other Extremity , thou
profane Professor of Puppetry , little better
than Poetry : then thou strong Debaucher
and Seducer of Youth ; witness this easie
and honest young Man : now thou Esquire
of Dames , Madams , and Twelve-penny La -
dies : now my green Madam her self , of
the price .
Let me unmask your Ladiship .
O my VVife , my VVife , my VVife !
Is she your VVife ?
Redde te Harpocartem !
By your leave , stand by my Masters , be unco-
O stay him , stay him , help to cry , Nightingale ;
my Pan , my Pan .
What 's the matter ?
He has stoln Gammer Ursla 's Pan .
Yes , and I fear no Man but Justice Overdoo .
Ursla ?
where is she ?
O the Sow of Enormity ,
this ! welcome , stand you there ; you , Songster , there .
An' please your Worship , I am in no fault : A
Gentleman stripp 'd him in my Booth , and borrow 'd his
Gown , and his Hat ; and he ran away with my Goods
here for it .
Then
Then this is the true Mad-man , and you are the
Enormity !
You are i' the right , I am mad , but from the
Gown outward .
Stand you there .
Where you please , Sir .
O lend me a Bason , I am sick , I am sick ;
where 's Mr. Over-doo ?
Bridget , call hither my Adam .
How ?
Dy very own Wife , i' fait , worshipful Adam .
Will not my Adam come at me ?
shall I see
him no more then ?
Sir , why do you not go on with the Enormity ?
are you opprest with it ?
I 'll help you : Hark you , Sir ,
i' your Ear , your Innocent Young Man , you have tane such
care of all this day , is a Cut-purse ; that hath got all your
Brother Cokes his things , and help 'd you to your beating ,
and the Stocks ; if you have a mind to hang him now ,
and shew him your Magistrates Wit , you may : but I
should think it were better recovering the Goods , and to
save your Estimation in him .
I thank you , Sir , for the
Gift of your Ward , Mrs. Grace : Look you , here is your
Hand and Seal , by the way .
Mr. Win-wife give you
Joy , you are Palemon , you are possest o ' the Gentlewo -
man , but she must pay me value , here 's Warrant for it .
To the Wi-
And , honest mad man , there 's thy Gown and
Cap again ; I thank thee for my Wife .
Nay ,
I can be mad , Sweet Heart , when I please
still ; never fear me : And careful Numps ,
where 's he ?
I thank him for my Licence .
How !
' Tis true , Numps .
I 'll be hang 'd then .
Look i' your Box , Numps ; nay , Sir , stand not
you fixt here , like a Stake in Finsbury , to be shot at , or
the Whipping-post i' the Fair , but get your Wife out o'the
Air , it will make her worse else ; and remember you are
but Adam , Flesh and Blood ! you have your frailty , for-
get your other Name of Over-doo , and invite us all to
There you and I will compare our Discoveries ;
and drown the memory of all Enormity in your bigg 'st
Bowl at home .
How now , Numps , ha' you lost it ?
I warrant
'twas when thou wert i' the Stocks : Why dost not
speak ?
I will never speak while I live again , for ought
I know .
Nay , Humphrey , if I be patient , you must be so
too ; this pleasant conceited Gentleman hath wrought
upon my Judgment , and prevail 'd : I pray you take care
of your sick Friend , Mistris Alice , and my good Friends
all ? ?
And no Enormities .
I invite you home with me to my House to sup -
per : I will have none fear to go along , for my intents are
Ad correctionem , non ad destructionem ; ad ?dificandum , non
ad diruendum : So lead on .
