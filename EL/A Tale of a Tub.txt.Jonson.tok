NOW o ' my Faith , Old Bishop Valen-
tine ,
You ha' brought us nipping weather :
Februere
Doth cut and shear ; your day , and Diocess
Are very cold .
All your Parishioners ;
As well your Layicks , as your Quiristers ,
Had need to keep to their warm Feather-beds ,
If they be sped of Loves : this is no season ,
To seek new Makes in ; though Sir Hugh of Pancrace ,
Be hither come to Totten , on intelligence ,
To the young Lord o ' the Mannor , Squire Tripoly ,
On such an Errand as a Mistris is .
What , Squire ! I say ?
I should call him too :
Sir Peter Tub was his Father , a Salt-petre-man ;
Who left his Mother , Lady Tub of Totten-
Court , here , to revel , and keep open House in ;
With the young Squire her Son , and 's Governour Basket-
Hilts , both by Sword and Dagger : Domine ,
Armiger Tub , Squire Tripoly , Expergiscere .
I dare not call alood , lest he should hear me :
And think I conjur 'd up the Spirit , her Son ,
In Priests-lack-Latine : O she is jealous
Of all Mankind for him .
Chanon , i 'st you ?
The Vicar of Pancrace , Squire Tub ! wa ' hoh !
I come , I stoop unto the call ; Sir Hugh !
He knows my lure is from his Love : fair Awdrey ,
Th'high Constables Daughter of Kentish-Town , here , Mr.
Tobias Turfe .
What news of him ?
He has wak 'd me
An hour before I would , Sir . And my duty
To the young Worship of Totten-Court , Squire Tripoly ;
Who hath my heart , as I have his : your Mrs.
Is to be made away from you , this morning ,
Saint Valentines day : there are a knot of Clowns ,
The Counsel of Finsbury , so they are y-styl 'd ,
Met at her Fathers ; all the wise o ' th ' hundred ;
Old Basi Clench of Hamsted , petty Constable ;
In-and-In Medlay , Cooper of Islington ,
And Headborough ; with loud To-Pan , the Tinker ,
Or Metal-man of Belsise , the Third-borough :
And D'ogenes Scriben , the great Writer of Chalcot .
And why all these ?
Sir , to conclude in Counsel ,
A Husband , or a Make for Mrs. Awdrey ;
Whom they have nam 'd , and prick 'd down , Clay of Kilborn ,
A tough young fellow , and a Tile-maker .
And what must he do ?
Cover her , they say :
And keep her warm , Sir : Mrs. Awdrey Turfe ,
Last night did draw him for her Valentine ;
Which chance , it hath so taken her Father and Mother ,
( Because themselves drew so , on Valentine 's Eve
Was thirty year ) as they will have her married
To day by any means ; they have sent a Messenger
To Kilborn , post , for Clay ; which when I knew ,
I posted with the like to worshipful Tripoly ,
The Squire of Totten : and my advise to cross it .
What is't , Sir Hugh ?
Where is your Governour Hilts ?
Basquet must do it .
Basquet shall be call 'd :
Hilts , can you see to rise ?
Cham not blind , Sir ,
With too much light .
Open your t 'other Eye ,
And view if it be day .
Che can spy that
At 's little a hole as another , through a Milstone .
He will ha' the last word , though he talk Bilke
Bilke ?
what 's that ?
Why , nothing , a word signifying
Nothing ; and borrow 'd here to express nothing .
A fine device !
Yes , till we hear a finer .
What 's your device now , Chanon Hugh ?
In private .
Lend it your Ear ; I will not trust the Air with it ;
Or scarce my Shirt ; my Cassock sha' not know it ;
If I thought it did , I 'll burn it .
That 's the way ,
You ha' thought to get a new one , Hugh : Is't worth it ?
Let 's hear it first .
Then hearken , and receive it .
This 'tis , Sir , do you relish it ?
If Hilts
Be close enough to carry it ; there 's all .
making himself ready ,
It i' no Sand ?
nor Butter-milk ?
If't be ,
Ich'am no Zive , or Watring-pot , to draw
Knots i' your 'casions .
If you trust me , zo :
If not , praform it your zelves .
Cham no Man 's Wife ,
But resolute Hilts : you 'll vind me i' the Buttry .
A testy Clown : but a tender Clown , as wooll :
And melting as the Weather in a Thaw :
He 'll weep you , like all April : But he 'ull roar you ,
Like middle March afore : He will be as mellow ,
And tipsie too , as October : And as grave ,
And bound up like a Frost ( with the new year )
In January ; as rigid as he is rustick .
You know his Nature , and describe it well ;
I 'll leave him to your fashioning .
Stay , Sir Hugh ;
Take a good Angel with you , for your Guide :
And let this guard you homeward , as the blessing ,
To our device .
I thank you Squires Worship ,
Most humbly ( for the next , for this I am sure of . )
O for a Quire of these Voices , now ,
To chime in a Man 's Pocket , and cry chink !
One doth not chirp : it makes no harmony .
Grave Justice Bramble , next must contribute ;
His Charity must offer at this Wedding :
I 'll bid more to the Bason , and the Bride-Ale ;
Although but one can bear away the Bride .
I smile to think how like a Lottery
These Weddings are .
Clay hath her in possession ;
The Squire he hopes to circumvent the Tile-Kill :
And
And now , if Justice Bramble do come off ,
' Tis two to one but Tub may lose his bottom .
WHY , 'tis thirty year , e 'en as this day now ,
Zin Valentine 's day , of all days kursin 'd , look
you ;
And the zame day o ' the Month , as this Zin Valentine ,
Or I am vowly deceiv 'd .
That our High Constable ,
Mr. Tobias Turfe , and his Dame were married .
I think you are right .
But what was that Zin Valentine ?
Did you ever know 'um , Good-man Clench ?
Zin Valentine ,
He was a deadly Zin , and dwelt at High-gate ,
As I have heard ; but 'twas avore my time :
He was a Cooper too , as you are , Medlay ,
An' In-an-In : A woundy brag young vellow :
As th ' port went o ' hun then , and i' those days .
Did he not write his Name , Sim Valentine ?
Vor I have met no Sin in Finsbury Books ;
And yet I have writ 'em six or seven times over .
O' you mun look for the Nine deadly Sims ,
I ' the Church-books , D'oge ; not the high Constables ;
Nor i' the Counties : Zure , that same Zin Valentine ,
He was a stately Zin : an' he were a Zin ,
And kept brave house .
At the Cock and Hen in High-gate .
You ha' 'fresh 'd my rememory well in't ! neighbour Pan :
He had a Place in last King Harry 's time ,
Of sorting all the young Couples ; joyning 'em ,
And putting 'em together ; which is yet
Praform 'd , as on his day ? ?
Zin Valentine ;
As being the Zin o ' the Shire , or the whole County :
I am old Rivet still , and bear a Brain ,
The Clench , the Varrier , and true Leach of Hamsted .
You are a shrewd Antiquity , neighbour Clench !
And a great Guide to all the Parishes !
The very Bell-weather of the Hundred , here ,
As I may zay .
Mr. Tobias Turfe ,
High Constable , would not miss you , for a Score on us ,
When he doe 'scourse of the great Charty to us .
What 's that , a Horse ?
Can 'scourse nought but
a Horse ?
I ne 're read o ' hun , and that in Smith-veld Charty :
I ' the old Fabians Chronicles : nor I think
In any new .
He may be a Giant there ,
For ought I know .
You should do well to study
Records , Fellow Ball , both Law and Poetry .
Why , all 's but writing , and reading , is it Scriben ?
An't be any more , it 's meer cheating zure .
Vlat cheating : all your Law , and Poets too .
Mr. High Constable comes .
I 'll zay 't avore 'hun .
WHat 's that makes you all so merry , and loud ,
Sirs , ha ?
I could ha' heard you to my privy walk .
A Contervarsie 'twixt your two learn 'd Men here :
Annibal Puppy says , that Law and Poetry
Are both flat cheating ; All 's but writing and reading ,
He says , be 't Verse or Prose .
I think in conzience ,
He do ' zay true ?
Who is't do thwart 'un , ha ?
Why , my Friend Scriben , and't please your
Who , D'oge ?
my D'ogenes ?
a great Writer , marry !
He 'll vace me down , me my self sometimes ,
That Verse goes upon Veet , as you and I do :
But I can gi' 'un the hearing ; zit me down ,
And laugh at 'un ; and to my self conclude ,
The greatest Clerks are not the wisest Men
Here they ' re both ! What , Sirs , disputing ,
And holding Arguments of Verse and Prose ?
And no green thing afore the Door , that shews ,
Or speaks a Wedding ?
Those were Verses now ,
Your Worship spake , and run upon vive veet .
Feet , vrom my Mouth , D'oge ?
Leave your ,
'zurd uppinions :
And get me in some Boughs .
Let 'em ha' Leaves first .
There 's nothing green but Bays and Rosemary .
And they 're too good for strewings , your Maids
You take up ' Dority still , to vouch against me .
All the twelve Smocks i' the house , zur , are your Authors .
Get some fresh Hay then , to lay under foot :
Some Holly and Ivy , to make vine the Posts :
Is't not Son Valentine 's day ?
and Mrs. Awdrey ,
Your young Dame to be married ?
I wonder Clay
Should be so tedious : He 's to play Son Valentine !
And the Clown sluggard 's not come fro ' Kilborn yet ?
Do you call your Son i' Law Clown , and't please
your Worship ?
Yes , and vor worship too , my neighbour Medlay .
A Middlesex Clown , and one of Finsbury :
They were the first Colon 's o ' the Kingdom here :
The Primitory Colon 's , my D'ogenes says .
VVhere 's D'ogenes , my VVriter , now ?
VVhat were those
You told me , D'ogenes , were the first Colon 's
O' the Countrey , that the Romans brought in here ?
The Colony .
Sir , Colonus is an Inhabitant :
A Clown Original : as you 'ld zay a Farmer , a Tiller o '
th ' Earth ,
E're sin' the Romans planted their Colony first ,
VVhich was in Meddlesex .
VVhy so ?
I thank you heartily , good D'ogenes ,
you ha' zertified me .
I had rather be an ancient Colon , ( as they zay ) a Clown
of Middlesex :
A good rich Farmer , or High Constable .
I'ld play hun 'gain a Knight , or a good Squire ;
Or Gentleman of any other County
I ' the Kingdom .
Out-cept Kent , for there they landed
All Gentlemen , and came in with the Conquerour ,
Mad Julius C?sar , who built Dover-Castle :
My Ancestor To-Pan , beat the first Kettle-Drum
Avore 'hun , here vrom Dover on the March :
VVhich piece of Monumental Copper hangs
Up , scour 'd , at Hammer-smith yet ; for there they came
Over the Thames , at a low Water-mark ;
Vore either London , I , or Kingston-Bridge ? ?
I doubt were kursin 'd .
Zee , who is here : John Clay !
Zon Valentine , and Bridegroom ! ha' you zeen
Your Valentine-Bride yet , sin' you came ?
John Clay ?
NO wusse .
Che lighted , I , but now i' the yard :
Puppy ha' scarce unswadled my legs yet .
What ?
wispes o ' your Wedding-day , zon ?
This is right
Originous Clay : and Clay o ' Kilborn too !
I would ha' had Boots o ' this day , zure , zon |John .
I did it to save charges : we mun dance ,
O' this day , zure : and who can dance in boots ?
No, I got on my best straw-coloured stockins ,
And swaddel 'd 'em over to zave Charges ; I.
And his new Shamois Doublet too with Points :
I like that yet : and his long Sawsedge-hose ,
Like the Commander of Four smoaking Tile-kills ,
Which he is Captain of : Captain of Kilborn :
Clay with his Hat turn 'd up o ' the leer side too :
As if he would leap my Daughter yet e 'er night ,
And spring a new Turfe to the old House .
Look , and the Wenches ha' not vound 'un out ,
And do parzent un with a Van of Rosemary ,
And Bays , to vill a Bow-pot , trim the Head
Of my best Vore-horse ; we shall all ha' Bride-laces ,
Or Points , I zee ; my Daughter will be valiant ,
And prove a very Mary Anbry i' the business .
They zaid your Worship had sur 'd her to Squire Tub
Of Totten-Court here ; all the Hundred rings on't .
A Tale of a Tub , Sir , a meer Tale of Tub .
Lend it no Ear I pray you : The Squire Tub
Is a fine Man , but he is too fine a Man ,
And has a Lady Tub too to his Mother :
I 'll deal with none o ' those vine silken Tubs .
John Clay , and Cloth-breech for my Money and Daughter .
Here comes another old Boy too , vor his Colours
Will stroak down my Wives Udder of Purses , empty
Of all her Milk-money , this Winter Quarter :
Old Father Rosin , the chief Minstrel here :
Chief Minstrel too of Highgate : she has hir 'd him
And all , his two Boys for a day and a half ,
And now they come for Ribbanding , and Rosemary :
Give 'em enough Girls , gi' 'em enough , and take it
Out in his Tunes anon .
I 'll ha' Tom Tiler ,
For our John Clay 's sake , and the Tile-kills , zure .
And I the jolly Joyner , for mine own sake .
I 'll ha'the joviall Tinker for To-Pan 's sake .
We 'll all be jovy this day , vor son Valentine .
My sweet son John 's sake .
There 's another reading now :
My Mr. reads it Son , and not Sin Valentine .
Nor Zim : And he is i'the right .
He is high Constable .
And who should read above 'un , or avor 'hun ?
Son John shall bid us welcome all , this day :
We 'll zerve under his colours : Lead the troop John ,
And Puppy , see the Bells ring .
Press all noises
Of Finsbury , in our name ; D'ogenes Scriben
Shall draw a score of warrants vor the business .
Do 's any wight perzent hir Majesties person ,
This Hundred , 'bove the high Constable ?
No, no .
Use our Authority then , to the utmost on't .
SO , you are sure , Sir , to prevent 'hem all ;
And throw a block i' the Bride-grooms way ,
John Clay ,
That he will hardly leap o 'er .
I conceive you ,
Sir Hugh ; as if your Rhetorick would say ,
Whereas the Father of her is a Turfe ,
A very superficies of the earth ;
He aims no higher , then to match in clay ;
And there hath pitch 'd his rest .
Right Justice Bramble ?
You ha' the winding wit , compassing all .
Subtile Sir Hugh , you now are i' the wrong ,
And err with the whole Neighbour-hood , I must tell you ;
For you mistake my name .
Justice Preamble
I write my self ; which with the ignorant Clowns here ,
( Because of my Profession of the Law ,
And place o ' the peace ) is taken to be Bramble .
But all my warrants , Sir , do run Preamble :
Richard Preamble .
Sir I thank you for't .
That your good worship , would not let me run
Longer in error , but would take me up thus ?
You are my learned , and canonick neighbour :
I would not have you stray ; but the incorrigible
Knot-headed beast , the Clowns , or Constables ,
Still let them graze ; eat Salads ; chew the Cud :
All the town-musick will not move a log .
The Beetle and wedges will where you will have 'hem .
True , true , Sir Hugh , here comes Miles Metaphor ,
My Clerk : He is the man shall carry it , Canon ,
By my instructions .
He will do 't ad unguem :
Miles Metaphore : He is a pretty fellow .
I love not to keep shadowes , or half-wits ,
To foil a business .
Metaphore ! you ha' seen
A King ride fort hin state .
Sir , that I have :
King Edward our late Leige , and soveraign Lord :
And have set down the pomp .
Therefore I ask 'd you ,
Ha' you observ 'd the Messengers o ' the Chamber ;
What habits they were in ?
Yes , Minor Coats .
Unto the guard , a Dragon , and a grey-hound ,
For the supporters of the Arms .
Well mark 'd ;
You know not any of 'em ?
Here 's one dwells
In Maribone .
Ha' you acquaintance with him ,
To borrow his coat an hour ?
Or but his badge ,
' Twill serve : A little thing he wears on his breast .
His coat , I say , is of more authority :
Borrow his coat for an hour .
I do love
To do all things compleatly , Canon Hugh ;
Borrow his coat , Miles Metaphor , or nothing .
The Taberd of his office , I will call it ,
Or the Coat-armour of his place : and so
Insinuate with him by that Trope ? ? .
I know your powers of Rhetorick , Metaphor .
Fetch him off in a fine figure for his coat I say .
goes out .
I 'll take my leave , Sir , of your worship too :
Because I may expect the issue anon .
Stay , my diviner Counsel , take your fee ;
We that take fees , allow ' hem to our Counsel ;
And our prime learned Counsel , double fees :
There are a brace of Angels to support you
I ' your Foot-walk this Frost , for fear of falling ,
Or spraying of a point of Matrimony ,
When you come at it .
I ' your Worships service :
That the Exploit is done , and you possest
Of Mrs. Awdrey Turfe .
I like your Project .
And I , of this effect of two to one ;
It worketh i' my Pocket , 'gainst the Squire ,
And his half bottom here , of half a Piece :
Which was not worth the stepping o 'er the Stile for :
His Mother has quite ma rr 'd him : Lady Tub ,
She 's such a Vessel of F?ces : all dry 'd Earth !
Terra damnata ! not a drop of Salt !
Or Petre in her ! All her Nitre is gone .
IS the Nag ready Martin ?
call the Squire .
This frosty morning we will take the Air ,
About the Fields : for I do mean to be
Some-bodies Valentine , i' my Velvet Gown ,
This morning , though it be but a Beggarman .
Why stand you still , and do not call my Son ?
Madam , if he had couched with the Lamb ,
He had no doubt been stirring with the Lark :
But he sat up at Play , and watch 'd the Cock ,
Till his first warning chid him off to rest .
Late Watchers are no early Wakers , Madam :
But if your Ladiship will have him call 'd .
V v v Lad .
Will have him call 'd ?
Wherefore did I , Sir , bid
him
Be call 'd , you Weazel , Vermine of an Huisher ?
You will return your Wit to your first stile
Of Marten Polcat , by these stinking Tricks ,
If you do use 'em : I shall no more call you
Pol-martin , by the Title of a Gentleman ,
If you go on thus ? ?
I am gone .
goes out .
Be quick then ,
I ' your come off : and make amends you Stote !
Was ever such a Full-mart for an Huisher ,
To a great worshipful Lady , as my self ;
Who , when I heard his Name first , Martin Polcat ,
A stinking Name , and not to be pronounc 'd
In any Ladies presence : my very heart e 'en earn 'd , see -
ing the Fellow
Young , pretty and handsome ; being then , I say ,
A Basket-Carrier , and a man condemn 'd
To the Salt-peter Works ; made it my Suit
To Mr. Peter Tub , that I might change it ;
And call him as I do now , by Pol-martin ,
To have it sound like a Gentleman in an Office ,
And made him mine own Fore-man , daily Waiter ,
And he to serve me thus ! Ingratitude !
Beyond the Courseness yet of any Clownage ,
Shew'n to a Lady ! what now , is he stirring ?
Stirring betimes out of his Bed , and ready .
And comes he then ?
No, Madam , he is gone .
Gone ?
whither ?
ask the Porter : Where 's he
gone ?
I met the Porter , and have ask 'd him for him ;
He says , he let him forth an hour a-go .
An hour ago ! what business could he have
So early ?
Where is his Man , grave Basket Hilts ?
His Guide and Governour ?
Gone with his Master .
Is he gone too ?
O that same surly Knave ,
Is his right hand ; and leads my Son amiss .
He has carried him to some drinking Match , or other :
Pol-martin , I will call you so again :
I ' am Friends with you now .
Go , get your Horse , and
ride
To all the Towns about here , where his haunts are ;
And cross the Fields to meet , and bring me word :
He cannot be gone far , being a foot .
Be curious to inquire him : and bid Wispe ,
My Woman , come , and wait on me .
The love
We Mothers bear our Sons , we ha' bought with pain ,
Makes us oft view them , with too careful Eyes ,
And over-look 'em with a jealous fear ,
Out-fitting Mothers .
HOw now , Wispe ?
Ha' you
A Valentine yet ?
I 'm taking th ' air to chuse one .
Fate send your Ladyship a fit one then .
VVhat kind of one is that ?
A proper Man ,
To please your Ladyship .
Out o ' that Vanity ,
That takes the foolish Eye : Any poor creature ,
VVhose want may need my alms , or courtesie ,
I rather wish ; so Bishop Valentine
Left us Example to do Deeds of Charity ;
To feed the hungry , cloath the naked , visit
The weak and sick ; to entertain the poor ,
And give the dead a Christian Funeral :
These were the works of Piety he did practise ,
And bade us imitate ; not look for Lovers ,
Or handsome Images to please our Senses .
I pray thee , Wispe , deal freely with me now :
VVe are alone , and may be merry a little :
Tho ' art none o ' the Court-Glories , nor the VVonders
For VVit or Beauty i' the City : tell me ,
VVhat Man would satisfie thy present Fancy ?
Had thy ambition leave to chuse a Valentine ,
VVithin the Queens Dominion , so a Subject .
Yo ' ha' gi' me a large scope , Madam , I confess ,
And I will deal with your Ladyship sincerely :
I 'll utter my whole heart to you .
I would have him
The bravest , richest , and the properest Man
A Taylor could make up ; or all the Poets ,
VVith the Perfumers : I would have him such ,
As not another VVoman , but should spite me :
Three City-Ladies should run mad for him :
And Country-Madams infinite .
You 'ld spare me ,
And let me hold my Wits ?
I should with you ? ?
For the young Squire , my Master 's sake , dispense
A little ; but it should be very little .
Then all the Court-Wives I'ld ha' jealous of me ,
As all their Husbands jealous of them :
And not a Lawyers Puss of any Quality ,
But lick her lips , for a snatch in the Terme time .
Come ,
Let 's walk : we 'll hear the rest as we go on :
You are this Morning in a good Vein , Dido :
Would I could be as merry .
My Son 's absence
Troubles me not a little : though I seek
These ways to put it off ; which will not help :
Care that is entred once into the Breast ,
Will have the whole possession , ere it rest .
ZOn Clay , cheer up , the better leg avore :
This is a veat is once done , and no more .
And then 'tis done vor ever , as they say .
Right ! vor a Man ha' his hour , and a Dog his
True , Neighbour Medlay , yo ' are still In-and-In .
I would be Mr. Constable , if ch ' could win .
I zay , John Clay , keep still on his old gate :
Wedding and hanging both go at a rate .
Well said , To-Pan : you ha' still the hap to hit
The Nail o ' the head at a close : I think there never
Marriage was manag 'd with a more avisement ,
Than was this Marriage , though I say 't , that should not ;
Especially 'gain' mine own Flesh and Blood ,
My wedded Wife .
Indeed my Wife would ha' had
All the young Batchelors and Maids , forsooth ,
O' the zix Parishes hereabout : But I
Cry 'd none , sweet Sybil : none of that gear , I :
It would lick zalt , I told her , by her leave .
No, three or vour our wise , choice honest neighbours :
Upstantial persons : Men that ha' born Office :
And mine own Family would be enough
To eat our Dinner .
What ?
Dear Meat 's a Thief :
I know it by the Butchers , and the Market-volk ;
Hum drum I cry .
No half-Ox in a Pye :
A man that 's bid to Bride-Ale , if he ha' Cake ,
And Drink enough , he need not vear his stake .
' Tis right : he has spoke as true as a Gun : be-
lieve it .
Come , Sybil , come : Did not I tell you o ' this ?
This Pride , and muster of women would mar all ?
Six women to one Daughter and a Mother !
The Queen ( God save her ) ha' no more her self .
Why , if you keep so many , Mr. Turfe ,
Why should not all present our Service to her ?
Your Service ?
Good ! I think you 'll write to
her shortly ,
Your very loving and obedient Mother .
Come , send your Maids off , I will have 'em sent
Home again , Wife : I love no Trains o ' Kent ,
Or Christendom , as they say .
We will not back ,
And leave our Dame .
Why should her Worship
lack
Her Tale of Maids , more than you do of Men ?
VVhat , mutining , Madge ?
Zend back your
C'lons agen .
And we will vollow .
Else we 'll guard our Dame .
I ha' zet the Nest of VVasps all on a flame .
Come , you are such another , Mr. Turfe :
A Clod you should be call 'd , of a High Constable :
To let no Musick go afore your Child
To Church , to chear her Heart up this cold Morning .
You are for Father Rosin , and his Consort
Of fidling Boys , the great Feates , and the less :
Because you have entertain 'd 'em all from Highgate .
To shew your Pomp , you 'ld ha' your Daughter and Maids
Dance o 'er the Fields like Fairies , to Church , this Frost ?
I 'll ha' no Rondels , I , i' the Queens Paths ;
Let 'un scrape the Gut at home , where they ha' fill 'd it
At After-noon .
I 'll ha' 'em play at Dinner .
She is i' th ' right , Sir ; vor your Wedding-Dinner
Is starv 'd without the Musick .
If the Pies
Come not in piping hot , you ha' lost that Proverb .
I yield to truth : Wife , are you sussified ?
A right good Man ! when he knows right , he
loves it .
And he will know't , and shew't too by his place
Of being High Constable , if no where else .
WEll over-taken , Gentlemen ! I pray you ,
Which is the Queens High Constable a -
mong you ?
The tallest Man : who should be else , do you
think ?
It is no matter what I think , young Clown :
Your answer savours of the Cart .
How ?
Cart ?
And Clown ?
Do you know whose Team you speak to ?
No: nor I care not : VVhose Jade may you be ?
Jade ?
Cart ?
and Clown ?
O for a lash of
VVhip-cord !
Three-knotted Cord !
Do you mutter ?
Sir , snorle this way ,
That I may hear , and answer what you say ,
VVith my School-dagger , 'bout your Costard , Sir .
Look to't , young Growse : I 'll lay it on , and sure ;
Take 't off who 's wull .
Nay , 'pray you Gentleman ? ?
Go to : I will not bate him an ace on't .
VVhat ?
Rowle-powle ?
Maple-face ?
All Fellows ?
Do you hear , Friend ?
I would wish you vor
your good ,
Tie up your brended Bitch there , your Dun rusty
Pannier-hilt Poinard : and not vex the Youth
VVith shewing the Teeth of it .
VVe now are going
To Church , in way of Matrimony , some on us .
Th'a'rung all in a' ready .
If it had not ,
All the Horn-Beasts are grazing i' this Close ,
Should not ha' pull 'd me hence , till this Ash-plant
Had rung Noon o ' your Pate , Mr. Broom-beard .
That would I fain zee , quoth the blind George
Of Holloway : Come , Sir .
O their naked weapons !
For the Passion of Man , hold Gentleman , and Puppy .
Murder , O Murder !
O my Father and Mother !
Husband , what do you mean ?
Son Clay , for
God 's sake ? ?
I charge you in the Queens Name , keep the peace .
Tell me o ' no Queen , or Keysar : I must have
A Leg , or a Hanch of him , e 're I go .
But , Zir ,
You must obey the Queens High Officers .
VVhy must I , Goodman Must ?
You must , an' your wull .
Gentleman , I 'm here for Fault , High Con-
stable ? ?
Are you zo ?
what then ?
I pray you , Sir , put up
Your Weapons ; do , at my Request : For him ,
On my Authority , he shall lie by the heels ,
Verbatim continente , an' I live .
Out on him for a Knave : what a dead fright
He has put me into : Come , Awdrey , do not shake .
But is not Puppy hurt ?
nor the t ' other man ?
No Bun ; but had not I cry 'd Murder , I wuss ?
Sweet Goodman Clench , I pray you revise my
Master ,
I may not zit i' the Stocks , till the Wedding be past ,
Dame , Mrs. Awdrey : I shall break the Bride-Cake else .
Zomething must be to save Authority , Puppy .
Husband ? ?
And Gossip ? ?
Father ? ?
' Treat me not .
It is i' vain .
If he lie not by the heels ,
I 'll lie there for 'un .
I 'll teach the Hine ,
To carry a Tongue in his Head to his Superiours .
This 's a wise Constable ! where keeps he School ?
In Kentish-Town ; a very survere man .
But as survere as he is , let me , Sir , tell him ,
He sha' not lay his Man by the heels for this .
This was my Quarrel : And by his Office leave ,
If't carry 'un for this , it shall carry double ;
Vor he shall carry me too .
Breath of Man !
He is my Chattel , mine own hired Goods :
An' if you do abet 'un in this matter ,
I 'll clap you both by the heels , ankle to ankle .
You 'll clap a Dog of Wax as soon , old Blurt ?
Come , spare not me , Sir ; I am no Man 's Wife :
I care not , I , Sir , not three skips of a Louse for you ,
And you were Ten tall Constables , not I.
Nay , pray you , Sir , be not angry ; but content :
My Man shall make you what amends you 'll ask 'un .
Let 'hun mend his Manners then , and know his
Betters :
It 's all I ask 'un : and 'twill be his own ,
And 's Master 's too , another day .
Che vore 'hun .
As right as a Club still .
Zure this angry man
Speaks very near the mark , when he is pleas 'd .
I thank you , Sir ; an' I meet you at Kentish-Town ,
I ha' the Courtesie o ' Hundred for you .
Gramercy , good High Constables Hine .
But
hear you ?
Mass Constable , I have other manner o ' matter ,
To bring you about , than this .
And so it is ,
I do belong to one o ' the Queens Captains ;
A Gent 'man o ' the Field , one Captain Thum 's ,
I know not whether you know 'un , or no : It may be
You do , and't may be you do not again .
No, I assure you on my Constable-ship ,
I do not know 'un .
Nor I neither , i' faith .
It skills not much ; my Captain , and my self ,
Having occasion to come riding by , here ,
This morning , at the corner of Saint John 's Wood ,
Some mile o ' this Town , were set upon
By a sort of Countrey Fellows ; that not only
Beat us , but robb 'd us most sufficiently ;
And bound us to our behaviour , hand and foot ;
V v v 2 And
And so they left us .
Now , Don Constable ,
I am to charge you in her Majesties Name ,
As you will answer it at your apperil ,
That forthwith you raise Hue and Cry i' the Hundred ,
For all such persons as you can despect ,
By the length and breadth o ' your Office : vor I tell you ,
The loss is of some value ; therefore look to't .
As Fortune mend me , now , or any Office
Of a thousand pound , if I know what to zay ,
Would I were dead ; or vaire hang 'd up at Tiburn ,
If I do know what course to take ; or how
To turn my self ; just at this time too , now ,
My Daughter is to be married : I 'll but go
To Pancridge-Church , hard by , and return instantly ,
And all my Neighbourhood shall go about it .
Tut , Pancridge , me no Pancridge ; if you let it
Slip , you will answer it , and your Cap be of Wool ;
Therefore take heed , you 'll feel the smart else , Constable .
Nay , good Sir , stay .
Neighbours ! what think
you o ' this ?
Faith , Man ? ?
Odd , precious Woman , hold your tongue ,
And mind your Pigs o ' the Spit at home ; you must
Have Ore in every thing .
Pray you , Sir , what kind
Of fellows were they ?
Thieve 's kind , I ha' told you .
I mean , what kind of Men ?
Men of our make .
Nay , but with patience , Sir ; we that are Officers
Must 'quire the special marks , and all the tokens
Of the despected parties ; or perhaps else
Be ne 'er the near of our purpose in 'prehending 'em .
Can you tell , what 'parrel any of them wore ?
Troth no : there were so many o ' un , all like
So one another : Now I remember me ,
There was one busie Fellow was their Leader ;
A blunt squat swad , but lower than your self ,
He ' had on a Leather Doublet , with long points ,
And a pair of pinn 'd-up breeches , like Pudding bags :
With yellow stockings , and his Hat turn 'd up
With a Silver Claspe on his leer side .
By these
Marks it should be John Clay , now bless the man !
Peace , and be nought : I think the Woman be
John Clay ?
what 's he , good Mistris ?
He that shall be
My Husband ? ?
How ! your Husband , pretty one ?
Yes , I shall anon be married : That 's he .
Passion o ' me , undone !
Bless Master 's Son !
O you are well 'prehended : know you me , Sir ?
No 's my Record : I never zaw you avore .
You did not ?
where were your Eyes then ?
out
at washing ?
What should a man zay ?
who should he trust
In these days ?
Hark you , John Clay , if you have
Done any such thing , tell troth , and shame the Devil .
Vaith do : my Gossip Turfe zays well to you , John .
Speak , man , but do not convess , nor be avraid .
A man is a man , and a beast 's a beast , look to't .
I ' the name of men or beasts ! what do you do ?
Hare the poor fellow out on his five Wits ,
And seven Senses ?
Do not weep , John Clay .
I swear the poor wretch is as guilty from it ,
As the Child was , was born this very morning .
No, as I am a kyrsin Soul , would I were hang 'd ,
If ever I ?
alas , I ! would I were out
Of my life , so I would I were , and in again ?
Nay , Mrs. Awdrey will say nay to that .
No, In-and-out ?
an' you were out o ' your life ,
How should she do for a Husband ?
who should fall
Aboard o ' her then , Ball ?
He 's a Puppy ?
No ; Hannibal has no breeding : well ! I say little ;
But hitherto all goes well , pray it prove no better .
Come , Father ; I would we were married : I
am a cold .
Well , Mr. Constable , this your fine Groom here ,
Bridegroom , or what Groom else , soe 'er he be ,
I charge him with the Felony ; and charge you
To carry him back forthwith to Paddington ,
Unto my Captain , who stays my return there :
I am to go to the next Justice of Peace ,
To get a Warrant to raise Hue and Cry ,
And bring him and his Fellows all afore 'un .
Fare you well , Sir , and look to 'un , I charge you ,
As yo 'll answer it .
Take heed , the business ,
If you defer , may prejudicial you
More than you think for ; zay I told you so .
Here 's a Bride-ale indeed ?
Ah zon John , zon Clay !
I little thought you would ha' prov 'd a piece
Of such false Metal .
Father , will you believe me ?
Would I might never stir i' my new shooes ,
If ever I would do so voul a Fact .
Well , Neighbours , I do charge you to assist me
With 'un to Paddington .
Be he a true man , so :
The better for 'un .
I will do mine Office ,
An' he were my own begotten a thousand times .
Why , do you hear man ?
Husband ?
Mr. Turfe ?
What shall my Daughter do ?
Puppy , stay here .
Mother , I 'll go with you , and with my Father .
Nay , stay , sweet Mrs. Awdrey : here are none
But one Friend ( as they zay ) desires to speak
A word or two , cold with you : How do you veel
Your self this frosty morning ?
What ha' you
To do to ask , I pray you ?
I am a cold .
It seems you are hot , good Mrs. Awdrey .
You lye ; I am as cold as Ice is : Feel else .
Nay , you ha' cool 'd my Courage : I am past it ,
I ha' done feeling with you .
Done with me ?
I do defie you .
So I do , to say
You ha' done with me : you are a sawcy Puppy .
O you mistake ! I meant not as you mean .
Meant you not Knavery ?
No, not I.
Clay meant you all the Knavery , it seems ,
Who rather than he would be married to you ,
Chose to be wedded to the Gallows first .
I thought he was a dissembler ; he would prove
A slippery Merchant i' the Frost .
He might
Have married one first , and have been hang 'd after ,
If he had had a mind to't .
But you men ,
Fie on you .
Mrs. Awdrey , can you vind
I ' your heart to fancy Puppy ?
me poor Ball ?
You are dispos 'd to jeer one , Mr. Hannibal .
Pity o ' me ! the angry man with the beard !
Put on thy Hat , I look for no despect .
Where 's thy Master ?
Marry , he is gone
With the Picture of Despair , to Paddington .
Pr'y thee run after 'un , and tell 'un he shall
Find out my Captain lodg 'd at the Red Lyon
In Paddington ; that 's the Inn .
Let 'un ask
Vor Captain Thum 's ; And take that for thy pains :
He may seek long enough else .
Hie thee again .
Yes , Sir , you 'll look to Mrs. Bride the while ?
That I will : prethee haste .
What , Puppy ?
Puppy ?
Sweet Mrs. Bride , he 'll come again presently .
Here was no subtle device to get a Wench .
This Chanon has a brave pate of his own !
AA shaven pate ! and a right monger , y ' vaith !
This was his plot ! I follow Captain Thum 's ?
We robb 'd in Saint John 's Wood ?
I ' my t 'other Hose !
I laugh to think what a fine Fool 's finger they have
O' this wise Constable , in pricking out
This Captain Thum 's to his Neighbours : you shall see
The Tile-man too set fire on his own Kill ,
And leap into it , to save himself from hanging .
You talk of a Bride-ale , here was a Bride-ale broke
I ' the nick .
Well : I must yet dispatch this Bride ,
To mine own master , the young Squire , and then
My task is done .
Gen'woman ! I have in sort
Done you some wrong , but now I 'll do you what right
I can : It 's true , you are a proper Woman ;
But to be cast away on such a Clown-pipe
As Clay ; me thinks your Friends are not so wise
As Nature might have made 'em ; VVell , go too :
There 's be tter Fortune coming toward you ,
An' you do not deject it .
Take a vool 's
Counsel , and do not stand i' your own light .
It may prove better than you think for : Look you .
Alas , Sir , what is't you would ha' me do ?
I'ld fain do all for the best , if I knew how .
Forsake not a good turn when 'tis offered you ;
Fair Mistris Awdrey , that 's your Name , I take it .
No Mistris , Sir , my Name is Awdrey .
VVell , so it is , there is a bold young Squire ,
The Blood of Totten , Tub , and Tripoly ? ?
Squire Tub , you mean ?
I know him : he knows
me too .
He is in love with you : and more , he 's mad for
I , so he told me : in his VVits , I think .
But he 's too fine for me ; and has a Lady
Tub to his Mother .
Here he comes himself !
Oyou are a trusty Governour !
What ails you ?
You do not know when yo ' are well , I think :
You 'ld ha' the Calf with the white Face , Sir , would you ?
I have her for you here ; what would you more ?
Quietness , Hilts , and hear no more of it .
No more of it , quoth you ?
I do not care ,
If some on us had not heard so much of't ,
I tell you true ; A man must carry and vetch ,
Like Bungy 's Dog for you .
What 's he ?
A Spaniel .
And scarce be spit i' the mouth for't .
A good Dog
Deserves , Sir , a good bone , of a free Master :
But , an' your turns be serv 'd , the Devil a bit
You care for a man after , e 're a Lard of you .
Like will to like , y-faith , quoth the scabb 'd Squire
To th ' mangy Knight , when both met in a Dish
Of butter 'd Vish .
One bad , there 's ne 'er a good ;
And not a Barrel better Herring among you .
Nay , Hilts ! I pray thee grow not fram-pull now .
Turn not the bad Cow after thy good Soap .
Our plot hath hitherto tane good effect :
And should it now be troubled , or stopp 'd up ,
' Twould prove the utter ruine of my hopes .
I pray thee haste to Pancridge , to the Chanon :
And gi' him notice of our good success ;
Will him that all things be in readiness .
Fair Awdrey , and my self , will cross the Fields ,
The nearest path .
Good Hilts , make thou some haste ,
And meet us on the way .
Come , gentle Awdrey .
Vaith , would I had a few more geances on't :
An' you say the word , send me to Jericho .
Out-cept a man were a Post-horse , I ha' not known
The like on't ; yet , an' he had kind words ,
' Twould never irke 'un .
But a man may break
His heart out i' these days , and get a flap
With a Fox-tail , when he has done .
And there is all .
Nay , say not so Hilts : hold thee ; there are
Crowns ? ?
My love bestows on thee , for thy reward ,
If Gold will please thee , all my Land shall drop
In bounty thus , to recompence thy merit .
Tut , keep your Land , and your Gold too , Sir : I
Seek neither ?
nother of 'un .
Learn to get
More : you will know to spend that zum you have
Early enough : you are assur 'd of me .
I love you too too well , to live o ' the spoil :
For your own sake , were there were no worse than I.
All is not Gold that glisters ; I 'll to Pancridge .
See how his love doth melt him into Tears !
An honest faithful Servant is a Jewel .
Now th ' adventrous Squire hath time and leisure
To ask his Awdrey how she do 's , and hear
A grateful answer from her .
She not speaks :
Hath the proud Tyran , Frost , usurp 'd the Seat
Of former Beauty in my Loves fair Cheek ;
Staining the Roseate tincture of her Blood ,
With the dull dye of blue congealing cold ?
No, sure the weather dares not so presume
To hurt an Object of her brightness .
Yet ,
The more I view her , she but looks so , so .
Ha ?
gi' me leave to search this mystery !
O now I have it : Bride , I know your grief ;
The last Nights cold hath bred in you such horror
Of the assigned Bridegroom 's constitution ,
The Killburn Clay-pit ; that Frost-bitten marle ;
That lump in Courage : melting Cake of Ice ;
That the conceit thereof hath almost kill 'd thee .
But I must do thee good , wench , and refresh thee .
You are a merry man , Squire Tub of Totten !
I have heard much o ' your words , but not o ' your deeds .
Thou sayest true , sweet ; I ' ha' been too slack in
Yet I was never so straight lac 'd to you , Squire .
Why , did you ever love me , gentle Awdrey ?
Love you ?
I cannot tell : I must hate no body ,
My Father says .
Yes , Clay and Kilbourne , Awdrey ,
You must hate them .
It shall be for your sake then .
And for my sake shall yield you that Gratuity .
Soft and fair , Squire , there go two words to a
What are those , Awdrey ?
Nay , I cannot tell .
My Mother zaid , zure , if you married me ,
You 'ld make me a Lady the first week : and put me
In , I know not what , the very day .
What was it ?
Speak , gentle Awdrey , thou shalt have it yet .
A Velvet Dressing for my Head , it is ,
They say will make one brave ; I will not know
Besse Moale , nor Margery Turne-up : I will look
Another way upon 'em , and be proud .
Troth , I could wish my Wench a better Wit ;
But what she wanteth there , her Face supplies .
There is a pointed lustre in her Eye
Hath shot quite through me , and hath hit my heart :
And thence it is I first receiv 'd the wound ,
That ranckles now , which only she can cure .
Fain would I work my self from this conceit ;
But , being flesh , I cannot .
I must love her ,
The naked truth is : and I will go on ,
Were it for nothing , but to cross my Rivals .
Come , Awdrey : I am now resolv 'd to ha' thee .
NAy , do it quickly , Miles ; Why shak 'st thou ,
Man ?
Speak but his Name : I 'll second thee my self .
What is his Name ?
Squire Tripoly , or Tub .
Any thing ? ? ?
Squire Tub , I do arrest you
I ' the Queens Majesties Name , and all the Councils .
Arrest me , Varlet ?
Keep the Peace , I charge you .
Are you there , Justice Bramble ?
Where 's your
Warrant ?
The Warrant is directed here to me ,
From the whole Table ; wherefore I would pray you
Be patient , Squire , and make good the Peace .
Well , at your pleasure , Justice .
I am wrong 'd :
Sirrah , what are you , have arrested me ?
He is a Purs'yvant at Arms , Squire Tub .
I am a Purs'yvant ; see , by my Coat else .
Well , Purs'yvant , go with me : I 'll give you Bail .
Sir , he may take no Bail .
It is a Warrant ,
In special from the Council , and commands
Your personal appearance .
Sir , your Weapon
I must require : And then deliver you
A Prisoner to this Officer , Squire Tub .
I pray you to conceive of me no other ,
Than as your Friend and Neighbour .
Let my Person
Be sever 'd from my Office in the Fact ,
And I am clear .
Here , Purs'yvant , receive him
Into your Hands ; and use him like a Gentleman .
I thank you , Sir : But whither must I go now ?
Nay , that must not be told you , till you come
Unto the place assign 'd by his Instructions .
I 'll be the Maidens Convoy to her Father ,
For this time , Squire .
I thank you , Mr. Bramble .
I doubt , or fear , you will make her the Ballance
To weigh your Justice in .
Pray ye do me right ,
And lead not her , at least , out of the way .
Justice is blind , and having a blind Guide ,
She may be apt to slip aside .
I 'll see to her .
I see my wooing will not thrive .
Arrested !
As I had set my rest up , for a Wife ?
And being so fair for it , as I was ? ?
Well , Fortune ,
Thou art a blind Bawd , and a Beggar too ,
To cross me thus ; and let my only Rival
To get her from me ?
That 's the Spight of Spights .
But most I muse at , is , that I , being none
O' th ' Court , am sent for thither by the Council .
My Heart is not so light as't was i' the morning .
YOu mean to make a Hoiden , or a Hare
O' me , t ' hunt Counter thus , and make these
doubles :
And you mean no such thing as you send about ?
Where 's your Sweet-heart now , I marle ?
Oh , Hilts !
I know you of old ! ne 'er halt afore a Criple .
Will you have a Cawdle ?
where 's your Grief , Sir ?
Speak ?
Do you hear , Friend ?
Do you serve this Gen-
tleman ?
How then , Sir ?
what if I do ?
Peradventure yea :
Peradventure nay ; what 's that to you , Sir ?
Say ?
Nay , pray you , Sir , I meant no harm in truth :
But this good Gentleman is arrested .
How ?
Say me that again .
Nay , Basket , never storm ;
I am arrested here , upon command
From the Queens Council ; and I must obey .
You say , Sir , very true , you must obey .
An honest Gentleman , in faith !
He must ?
But that which most tormenteth me , is this ,
That Justice Bramble hath got hence , my Awdrey .
How ?
how ?
stand by a little , Sirrah , you ,
With the Badge o ' your Breast .
Let 's know , Sir , what
you are ?
I am , Sir , ( pray you do not look so terribly )
A Purs'yvant .
A Purs'yvant ?
Your Name , Sir ?
My Name , Sir ? ?
What is't ?
speak ?
Miles Metaphor ;
And Justice Preamble 's Clerk .
What says he ?
Pray you ,
Let us alone .
You are a Purs'yvant ?
No, faith , Sir , would I might never stir from you ,
I ' is made a Purs'yvant against my Will .
Ha ! and who made you one ?
tell true , or my
Will
Shall make you nothing instantly .
Put up
Your frightful Blade ; and your dead-doing look ,
And I shall tell you all .
Speak then the truth ,
And the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
My Master , Justice Bramble , hearing your Master ,
The Squire Tub , was coming on this way ,
With Mrs. Awdrey , the High Constable 's Daughter ;
Made me a Purs'yvant : and gave me Warrant
To arrest him , so that he might get the Lady ,
With whom he is gone to Pancridge , to the Vicar ,
Not to her Fathers .
This was the Device ,
Which I beseech you , do not tell my Master .
O wonderful ! well Basket , let him rise :
And for my free Escape , forge some Excuse .
I 'll post to Paddington , t ' acquaint old Turfe ,
With the whole business , and so stop the Marriage .
Well , bless thee : I do wish thee Grace to keep
Thy Masters Secrets , better , or be hang 'd .
I thank you for your gentle admonition .
Pray you , let me call you God-father hereafter .
And as your God-son Metaphore , I promise ,
To keep my Masters Privities , seal 'd up
I ' the Vallies o ' my trust , lock 'd close for ever ,
Or let me be truss 'd up at Tiburne shortly .
Thine own Wish , save , or choak thee : Come
PAssion of me , was ever man thus cross 'd ?
All things run Arsie-Versie ; up-side down .
High Constable ! Now by our Lady o'Walsingham ,
I had rather be mark 'd out Tom Scavinger ,
And with a Shovel make clean the High-ways ,
Than have this Office of a Constable ,
And a High Constable ! The higher charge ,
It brings more trouble , more vexation with it .
Neighbours , good Neighbours , 'vize me what to do :
How we shall bear us in this Huy and Cry .
We cannot find the Captain ; no such man
Lodg 'd at the Lion , nor came thither hurt .
The morning we ha' spent in privy search ;
And by that means the Bride-Ale is deferr 'd ;
The Bride , she 's left alone in Puppy 's charge ;
The Bridegroom goes under a pair of Sureties ;
And held of all as a respected person .
How
How should we bustle forward ?
Gi' some counsel ,
How to bestir our stumps i' these cross ways .
Faith , Gossip Turfe , you have , you say , Remission ,
To comprehend all such as are despected :
Now would I make another privy search
Through this Town , and then you have zearch 'd Two
Masters , take heed , let 's not vind too many :
One 's enough to stay the Hang-man 's stomach .
There is John Clay , who is yvound already ;
A proper man : A Tile-man by his Trade :
A man , as one would zay , moulded in Clay :
As spruce as any Neigbbour 's Child among you :
And he (you zee ) is taken on Conspition ,
And two or three ( they zay ) what call you 'em ?
Zuch as the Justices of Coram nobis
Grant ? ?
( I forget their Names , you ha' many on 'em ,
Mr. High Constable , they come to you . )
I ha' it at my tongues end ? ?
Conny-boroughs ,
To bring him straight avore the Zessions house .
O , you mean Warrens , Neighbour , do you not ?
I , I , thick same ! you know 'un well enough .
Too well , too well ; wou 'd I had never known
We good Vree-holders cannot live in quiet ,
But every hour new purcepts , Hues and Crys ,
Put us to Requisitions night and day :
What shud a man zay , shud we leave the zearch ?
I am in danger to reburse as much
As he was robb 'd on ; I , and pay his hurts ,
If I should vollow it , all the good cheer
That was provided for the Wedding-dinner
Is spoil 'd and lost .
Oh , there are two vat Pigs ,
A zindging by the vier : Now by Saint Tomy ,
Too good to eat , but on a Wedding-day ;
And then a Goose will bid you all , Come cut me .
Zun Clay , zun Clay , ( for I must call thee so )
Be of good comfort ; take my Muckinder ,
And dry thine Eyes .
If thou beest true and honest ;
And if thou find 'st thy Conscience clear vrom it ,
Pluck up a good heart , we 'll do well enough .
If not , confess a truths name .
But in faith ,
I durst be sworn upon all holy Books
John Clay would ne 'er commit a Robbery
On his own head .
No: Truth is my rightful Judge :
I have kept my hands , here hence , fro ' evil speaking ,
Lying and slandering ; and my tongue from stealing ,
He do not live this day , can say , John Clay ,
I ha' zeen thee , but in the way of honesty .
Faith , Neighbour Medlay , I durst be his Bur-
rough ,
He would not look a true man in the vace .
I take the Town to concord , where I dwell ,
All Kilburn be my witness , if I were not
Begot in bashfulness , brought up in shamefac 'dness :
Let 'un bring a Dog , but to my vace , that can
Zay , I ha' beat 'un , and without a vault :
Or but a Cat , will swear upon a Book ,
I have as much as zet a vier her tail ;
And I 'll give him , or her a Crown for 'mends .
But to give out , and zay , I have robb 'd a Captain !
Receive me at the latter day , if I
E're thought of any such matter ; or could mind it ? ?
No, John , you are come of too good Personage ;
I think my Gossip Clench , and Mr. Turfe ,
Both think , you would ra'tempt no such voul matter .
But how unhappily it comes to pass !
Just on the Wedding-day ! I cry me mercy :
I had almost forgot the Hue and Cry :
Good Neighbour Pan , you are the Third-burrow ,
And D'ogenes Scriben , you my learned Writer ,
Make out a new purcept ?
Lord , for thy Goodness ,
I had forgot my Daughter , all this while ;
The idle Knave hath brought no news from her .
Here comes the sneaking Puppy ; What 's the news ?
My heart ! my heart ! I fear all is not well ,
Some things mishap 'd , that he is come without her .
OH , where 's my Master ?
my Master ?
my Ma -
ster ?
Thy Master ?
what would 'st with thy Ma -
ster , man ?
There 's thy Master .
What 's the matter , Puppy ?
Oh Master ! oh Dame ! oh Dame ?
oh Master !
What say 'st thou to thy Master , or thy Dame ?
John Clay ! John Clay ! John Clay !
What of John Clay ?
Luck grant he bring not news , he shall be hang 'd .
The world forfend , I hope it is not so well .
Oh Lord ! oh me ! what shall I do ?
poor John !
Oh John Clay ! John Clay ! John Clay !
Alas ,
That ever I was born ! I will not stay by 't ,
For all the Tiles in Kilburne .
What of Clay ?
Speak , Puppy ; what of him ?
He hath lost , he hath lost .
For luck sake , speak , Puppy ; what hath he lost ?
O , Awdrey , Awdrey , Awdrey !
What of my Daughter Awdrey ?
I tell you , Awdrey ? ?
do you understand me ?
Awdrey , sweet Master ! Awdrey , my dear Dame ? ?
Where is she ?
what 's become of her , I pray thee ?
Oh , the Serving-man ! the Serving-man ! the
Serving-man !
What talk 'st thou of the Serving-man ?
where 's
Awdrey ?
Gone with the Serving-man , gone with the Ser-
Good Puppy , whither is she gone with him ?
I cannot tell : he bad me bring you word ,
The Captain lay at the Lion , and before
I came again , Awdrey was gone with the Serving-man ;
I tell you , Awdrey 's run away with the Serving-man .
'Od 'socks ! my woman , what shall we do now ?
Now , so you help not , man , I know not , I.
This was your pomp of maids : I told you on't .
Six maids to vollow you , and not leave one
To wait upo ' your Daughter ! I zaid , Pride
Would be paid one day , her old vi'pence , wife .
What of John Clay , Ball Puppy ?
He hath lost ? ? ?
His life for velony ?
No, his wife by villainy .
Now , Villains both ! oh that same Hue and Cry !
Oh Neighbours ! oh that cursed Serving-man !
O maids ! O wife ! But John Clay , where 's he ?
How ! fled for vear , zay ye ?
will he slip us now ?
We that are Sureties , must require 'un out .
How shall we do to find the Serving-man ?
Cocks bodikins ! we must not lose John Clay :
Awdrey , my daughter Awdrey too ! let us zend
To all the Towns , and zeek her ; but alas ,
The Hue and Cry , that must be look 'd unto .
WHat , in a passion , Turfe ?
I , good Squire Tub .
Were never honest Varmers thus perplext ?
Turfe , I am privy to thy deep unrest :
The Ground of which springs from an idle plot ,
Cast by a Suitor , to your daughter Awdrey ? ?
And thus much , Turfe , let me advertise you ;
Your daughter Awdrey , met I on the way ,
With Justice Bramble in her company :
Who means to marry her at Pancridge-Church .
And there is Canon Hugh , to meet them ready :
Which to prevent , you must not trust delay ;
But winged speed must cross their sly intent :
Then hie thee , Turfe , haste to forbid the Banes .
Hath Justice Bramble got my daughter Awdrey ?
A little while shall he enjoy her , zure .
But O , the Hue and Cry ! that hinders me :
I must pursue that , or neglect my Journey :
I 'll e 'en leave all , and with the patient Ass ,
The over-laden Ass , throw off my burden ,
And cast mine Office ; pluck in my large Ears
Betimes , lest some dis-judge 'em to be Horns :
I 'll leave to beat it on the broken hoof ,
And ease my pasterns .
I 'll no more High Constables .
I cannot chuse but smile , to see thee troubled
With such a bald , half-hatched circumstance !
The Captain was not robb 'd , as is reported ;
That Trick the Justice craftily deviz 'd ,
To break the marriage with the Tile-man , Clay .
The Hue and Cry was meerly counterfeit :
The rather may you judge it to be such ,
Because the Bridegroom was describ 'd to be
One of the Thieves , first in the Velony .
Which , how far 'tis from him , your selves may guess :
' Twas Justice Bramble 's vetch , to get the wench .
And is this true , Squire Tub ?
Believe me , Turfe ,
As I am a Squire : or less , a Gentleman .
I take my Office back , and my Authority ,
Upon your Worship 's words .
Neighbours , I am
High Constable again : where 's my zon Clay ?
He shall be zon yet , wife , your meat by leisure :
Draw back the Spits .
That 's done already , Man .
I 'll break this Marriage off : and afterward ,
She shall be given to her first betroth 'd .
Look to the meat , wife : look well to the roast .
I 'll follow him aloof , to see the event .
Dame , Mistriss , though I do not turn the Spit ,
I hope yet the Pig 's Head .
Come up , Jack-sauce :
It shall be serv 'd in to you .
No, no Service ;
But a Reward for Service .
I still took you
For an unmannerly Puppy : Will you come ,
And vetch more Wood to the Vier , Mr. Ball ?
I Wood to the Vier : I shall piss it out first :
You think to make me e 'en your Ox or Ass ,
Or any thing .
Though I cannot right my self
On you , I 'll sure revenge me on your meat .
MAdam , to Kentish-Town , we are got at length ;
But by the way we cannot meet the Squire :
Not by Inquiry can we hear of him .
Here is Turfe 's House , the Father of the Maid .
Pol-Martin , see , the streets are strew 'd with herbs ,
And here hath been a Wedding , Wispe , it seems !
Pray Heaven this Bridal be not for my Son !
Good Martin , knock : knock quickly : Ask for Turfe .
My thoughts misgive me , I am in such a doubt ? ?
Who keeps the House here ?
Why , the Door and Walls
Do keep the House .
I ask then , who 's within ?
Not you that are without .
Look forth , and speak
Into the street here .
Come before my Lady .
Before my Lady ?
Lord have mercy upon me :
If I do come before her , she will see
The handsom 'st Man in all the Town , pardee !
Now stand I vore her , what zaith velvet she ?
Sirrah , whose Man are you ?
Madam , my Masters .
And who 's thy Master ?
What you tread on , Madam .
I tread on an old Turfe .
That Turfe 's my Master .
A merry fellow ! what 's thy Name ?
Ball Puppy
They call me at home : abroad , Hannibal Puppy .
Come hither , I must kiss thee , Valentine Puppy .
Wispe ! ha' you got you a Valentine ?
None , Madam :
He 's the first stranger that I saw .
To me
He is so , and such .
Let 's share him equally .
Help , help , good Dame .
A Rescue , and in time .
Instead of Bills , with Colstaves come ; instead of Spears ,
with Spits ;
Your slices serve for slicing Swords , to save me , and
my Wits :
A Lady , and her woman here , their Huisher eke by side ,
( But he stands mute ) have plotted how your Puppy to
HOw now ?
what noise is this with you , Ball
Puppy ?
Oh Dame ! and fellows o ' the Kitchin ! arm ,
Arm , for my safety ; if you love your Ball :
Here is a strange thing , call 'd a Lady , a Mad-dame :
And a device of hers , yclept her Woman ;
Have plotted on me , in the King 's High-way ,
To steal me from my self , and cut me in halfs ,
To make one Valentine to serve 'em both ;
This for my right-side , that my left-hand loves .
So saucy , Puppy ?
to use no more reverence
Unto my Lady , and her Velvet Gown ?
Turfe 's Wife , rebuke him not : Your Man doth
please me
With his conceit .
Hold : there are ten old Nobles ,
To make thee merrier yet , half-Valentine .
I thank you , right-side : could my left as much ,
' Twould make me a Man of Mark : young Hannibal !
Dido , shall make that good ; or I will for her .
Here Dido Wispe , there 's for your Hannibal :
He is your Countrey-man , as well as Valentine .
Here , Mr. Hannibal : my Ladies Bounty
For her poor Woman , VVispe .
Brave Carthage Queen !
And such was Dido : I will ever be
Champion to her , who Juno is to thee .
Your Ladyship is very welcome here .
Please you , good Madam , to go near the House .
Turfe 's Wife , I come thus far to seek thy Husband ,
Having some business to impart unto him .
Is
Is he at home ?
O no , and't shall please you :
He is posted hence to Pancridge , with a witness .
Young Justice Bramble has kept level coyl
Here in our Quarters , stole away our Daughter ,
And Mr. Turfe 's run after , as he can ,
To stop the Marriage , if it will be stopp 'd .
Madam , these tidings are not much amiss !
For if the Justice have the Maid in keep ,
You need not fear the marriage of your Son .
That somewhat easeth my suspicious breast .
Tell me , Turfe 's Wife , when was my Son with Awdrey ?
How long is't , since you saw him at your House ?
Dame , let me take this Rump out of your Mouth .
What mean you by that , Sir ?
Rump and Tale 's all one .
But I would use a Reverence for my Lady :
I would not zay surreverence , the Tale
Out o ' your Mouth , but rather take the Rump .
A well-bred Youth ! and vull of Favour you
What might they zay , when I were gone , if I
Not weigh 'd my words ?
This Puppy is a Vool !
Great Hannibal 's an Ass ; he had no breeding :
No Lady gay , you shall not zay ,
That your Val .
Puppy , was so unlucky ,
In speech to fail , as t ' name a Tail ,
Be as be may be , 'vore a fair Lady .
Leave jesting ; tell us , when you saw our Son .
Marry , it is two hours ago .
Sin' you saw him ?
You might have seen him too , if you had
look 'd up .
For it shin 'd as brighr as day .
Mean my Son .
Pup , Your Sun , and our Sun , are they not all one ?
Fool , thou mistak 'st ; I ask 'd thee , for my Son !
I had thought there had been no more Suns
than one .
I know not what you Ladies have , or may have .
Did 'st thou ne 'er hear my Lady had a Son ?
She may have twenty ; but for a Son , unless
She mean precisely , Squire Tub , her Zon ,
He was here now , and brought my Master word ,
That Justice Bramble had got Mrs. Awdrey .
But whither he be gone , here 's none can tell .
Martin , I wonder at this strange discourse :
The Fool it seems tells true ; my Son , the Squire ,
Was doubtless here this morning .
For the match ,
I 'll smother what I think , and staying here ,
Attend the Sequel of this strange beginning .
Turfe 's Wife , my people , and I will trouble thee ,
Until we hear some tidings of thy Husband .
The rather , for my party Valentine .
WEll , I have carried it , and will triumph
Over this Justice , as becomes a Constable ;
And a High Constable : next our Saint George ,
Who rescued the King 's Daughter , I will ride ;
Above Prince Arthur .
Or our Shore-ditch Duke .
Or Pancridge Earl .
Or Bevis , or Sir Guy ,
Who were High Constables both .
One of Southampton ? ?
The t 'other of VVarwick-Castle .
You shall work it
Into a Story for me , neighbour Medlay ,
Over my Chimney .
I can give you , Sir ,
A Roman Story of a Petty-Constable ,
That had a Daughter , that was call 'd Virginia ,
Like Mrs. Awdrey , and as young as she ;
And how her Father bare him in the business ,
' Gainst Justice Appius , a Decemvir in Rome ,
And Justice of Assize .
That , that good D'ogenes !
A Learned Man is a Chronicle !
I can tell you
A thousand , of great Pompey , C?sar , Trajan ,
All the High Constables there .
That was their place :
They were no more .
Dictator , and High Constable ,
Were both the same .
High Constable was more , though !
He laid Dick Tator by the heels .
Dick Toter !
H' was one o ' the Waights o ' the City : I ha' read o ' 'un :
He was a fellow would be drunk , debauch 'd ? ? ?
And he did zet 'un i' the Stocks indeed :
His name Vadian , and a cunning Toter .
Was ever silly Maid thus posted off ?
That should have had three Husbands in one day ;
Yet ( by bad Fortune ) am possest of none ?
I went to Church to have been wed to Clay ;
Then Squire Tub he seiz 'd me on the way ,
And thought to ha' had me ; but he mist his aim :
And Justice Bramble ( nearest of the three )
Was well nigh married to me ; when by chance ,
In rush 'd my Father , and broke off that dance .
I , Girl , there 's ne 'er a Justice on 'em all ,
Shall teach the Constable to guard his own :
Let 's back to Kentish-town , and there make merry ;
These news will be glad tidings to my Wife :
Thou shalt have Clay , my wench .
That word shall stand .
He 's found by this time , sure , or else he 's drown 'd :
The Wedding-dinner will be spoil 'd : make haste .
Husbands , they say , grow thick ; but thin are
I care not who it be , so I have one .
I?zay you zo ?
Perhaps you shall ha' none , for
Now out on me ! what shall I do then ?
Sleep , Mistris Awdrey , dream on proper Men .
OBone Deus ! have you seen the like ?
Here was Hodge , hold thine Ear fair , whilst
I strike .
Body o ' me , how came this gear about ?
I know not , Chanon , but it falls out cross .
Nor can I make conjecture by the Circumstance
Of these Events ; it was impossible ,
Being so close , and politickly carried ,
To come so quickly to the Ears of Turfe .
O Priest , had but thy slow delivery
Been nimble , and thy lazy Latine Tongue ,
But run the Forms o 'er , with that swift dispatch ,
As had been requisite , all had been well !
What should have been , that never lov 'd the Frier ;
But thus you see th ' old Adage verified ,
Multa cadunt inter ? ?
you can guess the rest .
Many things fall between the Cup and Lip :
And though they touch , you are not sure to drink .
You lack 'd good fortune , we had done our parts :
Give a Man fortune , throw him i' the Sea .
The properer Man , the worse luck : Stay a time ;
Tempus edax ?
In time the stately Ox , &c .
Good Counsels lightly never come too late .
You , Sir , will run your Counsels out of breath .
Spur a free Horse , he 'll run himself to death .
X x x Sancti
Sancti Evangelist? ! Here comes Miles !
What news , man , with our new-made Purs'yvant ?
A Pursuyvant ?
would I were , or more pursie ,
And had more store of money ; or less pursie ,
And had more store of breath : you call me Purs'yvant !
But I could never vaunt of any Purse
I had , sin' yo ' were my God-fathers and God-mothers ,
And ga' me that nick-name .
What now 's the matter ?
Nay , 'tis no matter .
I ha' been simply beaten .
What is become o ' the Squire , and thy Prisoner ?
The lines of Blood , run streaming from my Head ,
Can speak what Rule the Squire hath kept with me .
I pray thee , Miles , relate the manner , how ?
Be 't known unto you , by these Presents , then ,
That I , Miles Metaphor , your Worship 's Clerk ,
Have e 'en been beaten , to an Allegory ,
By multitude of hands .
Had they been but
Some five or six , I had whip 'd 'em all , like Tops
In Lent , and hurl 'd 'em into Hoblers-hole ;
Or the next Ditch : I had crack 'd all their Costards ,
As nimbly as a Squirrel will crack Nuts :
And flourished like to Hercules , the Porter ,
Among the Pages .
But , when they came on
Like Bees about a Hive , Crows about Carrion ,
Flies about Sweet-meats ; nay , like Water-men
About a Fare : then was poor Metaphor ,
Glad to give up the Honour of the Day ,
To quit his charge to them , and run away
To save his life , only to tell this news .
How indirectly all things have fall 'n out !
I cannot chuse but wonder what they were ,
Rescued your Rival from the keep of Miles :
But most of all I cannot well digest ,
The manner how our purpose came to Turfe .
Miles , I will see that all thy Hurts be drest .
As for the Squires Escape , it matters not :
We have by this means disappointed him ;
And that was all the main I aimed at .
But Chanon Hugh , now muster up thy Wits ,
And call thy thoughts into the Consistory .
Search all the secret corners of thy Cap ,
To find another queint devised drift ,
To disappoint her Marriage with this Clay :
Do that , and I 'll reward thee jovially .
Well said , Magister Justice .
If I fit you not
With such a new , and well-laid Stratagem ,
As never yet your Ears did hear a finer .
Call me , with Lily , Bos , Fur , Sus atq ; Sacerdos .
I hear , there 's comfort in thy words yet , Chanon .
I 'll trust thy Regulars , and say no more .
I 'll follow too .
And if the dapper Priest
Be but as cunning , point in his device ,
As I was in my lye : My Master Preamble
Will stalk , as led by the Nose with these new Promises ,
And fatted with Supposes of fine Hopes .
WEll , Madam , I may thank the Squire your Son :
For , but for him , I had been over-reacht .
Now Heavens Blessing light upon his Heart :
We are beholden to him , indeed , Madam .
But can you not resolve me where he is ?
Nor about what his Purposes were bent ?
Madam , they no whit were concerning me :
And therefore was I less inquisitive .
Fair Maid , in faith , speak truth , and not dissemble :
Do 's he not often come , and visit you ?
His Worship , now and then , please you , takes
pains
To see my Father and Mother : But , for me ,
I know my self too mean for his high thoughts
To stoop at , more than asking a light question ,
To make him merry , or to pass his time .
A Sober Maid ! call for my Woman , Martin .
The Maids , and her half-Valentine , have ply 'd her
With courtsie of the Bride-Cake , and the Bowle ,
As she is laid a while .
O , let her rest !
We will cross o 'er to Canterbury , in the interim ;
And so make home .
Farewel , good Turf , and thy Wife .
I wish your Daughter Joy .
Thanks to your Ladiship :
Where is John Clay now ?
have you seen him yet ?
No, he has hid himself out of the way ,
For fear o ' the Hue and Cry .
What , walks that Shadow
Avore 'un still ?
Puppy , go seek 'un out ,
Search all the corners that he haunts unto ,
And call 'un forth .
We 'll once more to the Church ,
And try our vortunes .
Luck , Son Valentine :
Where are the Wise Men all of Finsbury ?
Where WiseMen should be ; at the Ale , and Bride-
I would this Couple had their Destiny ,
Or to be hang 'd , or married out o ' the way :
Man cannot get the mount 'nance of an Egg-shell ,
To stay his Stomach .
Vaith , vor mine own part ,
I have zup 'd up so much Broth , as would have cover 'd
A Leg o ' Beef , o 'er Head and Ears , i' the Porridge-Pot :
And yet I cannot sussifie wild Nature .
Would they were once dispatch 'd , we might to dinner .
I am with Child of a huge Stomach , and long ,
Till by some honest Midwife-piece of Beef ,
I be deliver 'd of it : I must go now ,
And hunt out for this Kilbourn Calf , John Clay :
Whom where to find , I know not , nor which way .
THus as a Beggar in a King 's disguise ,
Or an old Cross , well sided with a May-pole ,
Comes Chanon Hugh , accoutred , as you see ,
Disguis 'd , Soldado like : Mark his Device :
The Chanon , is that Captain Thum 's , was robb 'd :
These bloody Scars upon my Face , are Wounds :
This Scarff upon mine Arm , shews my late Hurts :
And thus am I to gull the Constable .
Now have among you , for a Man at Arms :
Friends , by your leave ; which of you is one Turfe ?
Sir , I am Turfe , if you would speak with me .
With thee , Turfe , if thou beest High Constable .
I am both Turfe , Sir , and High Constable .
Then , Turfe , or Scurfe , High , or Low Constable :
Know , I was once a Captain at Saint Quintins ,
And passing cross the ways over the Countrey ,
This Morning , betwixt this and Hamsted-heath ,
Was by a Crew of Clowns robb 'd , bobb 'd , and hurt .
No sooner had I got my Wounds bound up ,
But with much pain , I went to the next Justice ,
One Mr. Bramble , here , at Maribone :
And here a Warrant is , which he hath directed
For you , one Turfe ; if your Name be Toby Turfe ;
Who have let fall ( they say ) the Hue and Cry :
And you shall answer it afore the Justice .
Heaven and Hell , Dogs , Devils , what is this ?
Neighbours , was ever Constable thus cross 'd ?
What shall we do ?
Faith , all go hang our selves :
I know no other way to scape the Law .
News , news , O news ? ?
What , hast thou found out Clay ?
No, Sir , the news is , that I cannot find him .
Why do you dally , you damn 'd Russet Coat ?
You Peasant , nay , you Clown , you Constable ;
See that you bring forth the suspected Party ,
Or by mine Honour ( which I won in Field )
I 'll make you pay for it , afore the Justice .
Fie , fie : O Wife , I 'm now in a fine pickle .
He that was most suspected is not found :
And which now makes me think , he did the Deed ,
He thus absents him , and dares not be seen .
Captain , my Innocence will plead for me .
Wife , I must go , needs , whom the Devil drives :
Pray for me , Wife , and Daughter ; pray for me .
I 'll lead the way : Thus is the Match put off :
And if my Plot succeed , as I have laid it ,
My Captain-ship shall cost him many a Crown .
So , we have brought our Eggs to a fair Market .
Out on that Villain , Clay : Would he do a Robbery ?
I 'll ne 'er trust smooth-fac 'd Tile-man for his sake .
Mother , the still Sow eats up all the Draffe .
Thus is my Master , Toby Turfe , the Pattern
Of all the painful a'ventures now in Print .
I never could hope better of this match :
This Bride-Ale : For the night before to day ,
( Which is within man 's memory , I take it , )
At the Report of it , an Ox did speak ;
Who dy 'd soon after : A Cow lost her Calf :
The Bell-wether was flea 'd for't : A fat Hog
Was sing 'd , and wash 'd , and shaven all over ; to
Look ugly 'gainst this day : The Ducks they quak 'd ;
The Hens too cackled : at the noise whereof ,
A Drake was seen to dance a headless round :
The Goose was cut i' the head , to hear it too :
Brave Chant-it-clear , his noble Heart was done ;
His Comb was cut : And two or three o ' his Wives ,
Or fairest Concubines , had their Necks broke ,
Ere they would zee this day ; To mark the verven
Heart of a Beast , the very Pig , the Pig ,
This very morning , as he was a roasting ,
Cry 'd out his Eyes , and made a show , as he would
Ha' bit in two the Spit ; as he would say ,
There shall no Roast-meat be this dismal day .
And zure , I think , if I had not got his Tongue
Between my Teeth , and eat it , he had spoke it .
Well , I will in , and cry too ; never leave
Crying , until our Maids may drive a Buck
With my salt Tears at the next washing-day .
KEep out those fellows ; I 'll ha none come in ,
But the High Constable , the Man of Peace ,
And the Queens Captain , the brave Man of War .
Now , Neighbour Turfe , the Cause why you are call 'd
Before me , by my Warrant , but unspecified ,
Is this ; and pray you mark it thoroughly !
Here is a Gentleman , and , as it seems ,
Both of good Birth , fair Speech , and peaceable ,
Who was this morning robb 'd here in the Wood :
You , for your part , a man of good Report ,
Of Credit , Landed , and of fair Demeans ,
And by Authority , High Constable ;
Are , notwithstanding , touch 'd in this Complaint ,
Of being careless in the Hue and Cry .
I cannot chuse but grieve a Soldiers loss ;
And I am sorry too for your neglect ,
Being my Neighbour : this is all I object .
This is not all ; I can alledge far more ,
And almost urge him for an Accessary .
Good Mr. Justice , gi' me leave to speak ,
For I am Plaintiff .
Let not Neighbourhood
Make him secure , or stand on privilege .
Sir , I dare use no partiality :
Object then what you please , so it be truth .
This more : and which is more than he can answer ,
Beside his letting fall the Hue and Cry ,
He doth protect the Man charg 'd with the Felony ,
And keeps him hid , I hear , within his House ,
Because he is affied unto his Daughter .
I do defie 'un , so shall she do too .
I pray your Worship 's Favour , le ' me have hearing .
I do convess , 'twas told me such a Velony ,
And't not disgriev 'd me a little , when 'twas told me ,
Vor I was going to Church , to marry Awdrey :
And who should marry her , but this very Clay ,
Who was charg 'd to be the chief Thief o ' 'un all .
Now I ( the Halter stick me , if I tell
Your Worships any Leazins ) did fore-think 'un
The truest Man , till he waz run away .
I thought I had had 'un as zure as in a Zaw-pit ,
Or i' mine Oven : Nay , i' the Town-pound .
I was za sure o ' 'un , I'ld ha' gi'n my life for 'un ,
Till he did start .
But now I zee 'un guilty ,
As var as I can look at 'un .
Would you ha' more ?
Yes , I will have , Sir , what the Law will give me .
You gave your word to see him safe , forth-coming ;
I challenge that : But that is forfeited ;
Beside , your carelessness in the pursuit ,
Argues your slackness , and neglect of duty ,
Which ought be punish 'd with severity .
He speaks but reason , Turfe .
Bring forth the Man ,
And you are quit : But otherwise , your word
Binds you to make amends for all his loss ,
And think your self be-friended , if he take it ,
Without a farther Suit , or going to Law .
Come to a Composition with him , Turfe :
The Law is costly , and will draw on charge .
Yes , I do know , I vurst mun vee a Returney ,
And then make Legs to my great Man o ' Law ,
To be o ' my counsel , and take trouble-vees ,
And yet zay nothing vor me , but devise
All district means , to ransackle me o ' my money .
A Pest 'lence prick the throats o ' 'un .
I do know 'un
As well az I was i' their Bellies , and brought up there .
What would you ha' me do ?
what would you ask of me ?
I ask the restitution of my money ;
And will not bate one penny o ' the sum :
Fourscore and five pound , I ask , besides
Amendment for my hurts ; my pain and suffering
Are loss enough for me , Sir , to sit down with ;
I 'll put it to your Worship ; what you award me ,
I 'll take ; and gi' him a general Release .
And what say you now , neighbour Turfe ?
I put it
E'en to your Worship 's bitterment , hab , nab .
I shall have a chance o ' the dice for't , I hope , let 'em e 'en
run : And ? ?
Faith , then I 'll pray you , 'cause he is my neighbour ,
To take a hundred pound , and give him day .
Saint Valentine 's day , I will , this very day ,
Before Sun set : my Bond is forfeit else .
Where will you ha' it paid ?
Faith , I am a stranger
Here i' the Countrey : Know you Chanon Hugh ,
The Vicar of Pancras ?
Yes , we who not him ?
I 'll make him my Attorney to receive it ,
And give you a Discharge .
Whom shall I send for't ?
Why , if you please , send Metaphor , my Clerk .
And Turfe , I much commend thy willingness ;
It 's argument of thy integrity .
But my Integrity shall be my zelf still :
Good Mr. Metaphor , give my Wife this Key ;
And do but whisper it into her Hand :
( She knows it well enow ) bid her , by that ,
X x x 2 De-
Deliver you the two zeal 'd Bags o ' Silver ,
That lie i' the corner o ' the Cup-board , stands
At my bed-side , they 're vifty pound a piece ;
And bring 'em to your Master .
If I prove not
As just a Carrier as my Friend , Tom Long , was ,
Then call me his Curtall , change my name of Miles ,
To Guile 's , Wile 's , Pile 's , Bile 's , or the foulest name
You can devise , to cramb with , for Ale .
Come hither , Miles , bring by that token too ,
Fair Awdrey ; say , her Father sent for her :
Say , Clay is found , and waits at Pancras-Church ,
Where I attend to marry them in haste .
For , ( by this means ) Miles , I may say 't to thee ,
Thy Master must to Awdrey married be .
But not a word but mum : go get thee gone ;
Be wary of thy charge , and keep it close .
O super-dainty Chanon ! Vicar in c?ney ,
Make no delay , Miles , but away .
And bring the Wench , and Money .
Now , Sir , I see you meant but honestly ;
And , but that business calls me hence away ,
I would not leave you till the Sun were lower .
But , Mr. Justice , one word , Sir , with you .
By the same token , is your Mistris sent for
By Metaphore , your Clerk , as from her Father .
Who when she comes , I 'll marry her to you ,
Unwitting to this Turfe , who shall attend
Me at the Parsonage .
This was my plot :
Which I must now make good ; turn Chanon again ,
In my Square Cap .
I humbly take my leave .
Adieu , good Captain .
Trust me , neighbour Turfe ,
He seems to be a sober Gentleman :
But this distress hath somewhat stirr 'd his patience .
And Men , you know , in such Extremities ,
Apt not themselves to points of Courtesie ;
I 'm glad you ha' made this end .
You stood my Friend :
I thank your Justice-worship ; pray you be
Prezent anon , at tendring o ' the Money ,
And zee me have a discharge : Vor I ha' no craft
I ' your Law Quiblins .
I 'll secure you , neighbour .
Indeed there is a woundy luck in names , Sirs ,
And a main Mystery , an' a Man knew where
To vind it .
My God-sires Name , I 'll tell you ,
Was In-and-In Shittle , and a Weaver he was ,
And it did fit his Craft : for so his Shittle
Went in , and in still ; this way , and then that way .
And he nam 'd me , In-and-In Medlay : which serves
A Joyners Craft , bycause that we do lay
Things in and in , in our work .
But , I am truly
Architectonicus Professor , rather :
That is , ( as one would zay ) an Architect .
As I am a Varrier , and a Visicary :
Horse-Smith of Hamsted , and the whole Town Leach ?
Yes , you ha' done woundy Cures , Gossip Clench .
An' I can zee the Stale once , through a Urine-hole ,
I 'll give a shrewd guess , be it Man or Beast .
I cur 'd an Ale-wife once , that had the Staggers
Worse than five Horses , without rowelling .
My God-phere was a Rabian , or a Jew ,
( You can tell , D'oge ! ) They call 'd 'un Doctor Rasi .
One Rasis was a great Arabick Doctor .
He was King Harry 's Doctor , and my God-phere .
Mine was a merry Greek , To-Pan , of Twyford :
A jovial Tinker , and a stopper of Holes ;
Who left me Metal-man of Belsise , his Heir .
But what was yours , D'oge ?
Vaith , I cannot tell ,
If mine were kyrsin 'd , or no .
But zure he had
A kyrsin Name , that he left me , Diogenes .
A mighty learned Man , but pest 'lence poor .
Vor h ' had no House , save an old Tub , to dwell in ,
( I vind that in Records ) and still he turn 'd it
I ' the Wind 's Teeth , as't blew on his back-side ,
And there they would lie rowting one at other ,
A Week sometimes .
Thence came A Tale of a Tub ;
And the virst Tale of a Tub , old D'ogenes Tub .
That was avore Sir Peter Tub , or his Lady .
I , or the Squire their Son , Tripoli Tub .
The Squire is a fine Gentleman !
He is more :
A Gentleman and a half ; almost a Knight ;
Within zix Inches : That 's his true measure .
Zure you can gage 'un .
To a streak , or less :
I know his D'ameters , and Circumference :
A Knight is six Diameters ; and a Squire
Is vive , and zomewhat more : I know't by compass ,
And skale of Man .
I have upo ' my Rule here ,
The just perportions of a Knight , a Squire ;
With a tame Justice , or an Officer rampant ,
Upo ' the Bench , from the High Constable
Down to the Headborough , or Tithing-man ;
Or meanest Minister o ' the Peace .
God save 'un .
Why , you can tell us by the Squire , Neighbour ,
Whence he is call 'd a Constable , and whaffore .
No, that 's a Book-case : Scriben can do that .
That 's writing and reading , and Records .
Two words ,
Cyning and Staple , make a Constable :
As we 'd say , a hold , or stay for the King .
All Constables are truly John 's for the King ,
What ere their Names are , be they Tony , or Roger .
And all are sworn , as vingars o ' one hand ,
To hold together 'gainst the breach o ' the Peace ;
The High Constable is the Thumb , as one would zay ,
The hold-fast o ' the rest .
Pray luck he speed
Well i' the business , between Captain Thums ,
And him .
I 'll warrant 'un for a Groat ;
I have his measures here in Rithmetique ,
How he should bear 'un self in all the Lines
Of 's Place and Office ; Let 's zeek 'un out .
HIlts , how do 'st thou like o ' this our good days
work ?
As good e 'en ne 'er a whit , as ne 'er the better .
Shall we to Pancridge , or to Kentish-town , Hilts ?
Let Kentish-town , or Pancridge , come to us ,
If either will : I will go home again .
Faith , Basket , our success hath been but bad ,
And nothing prospers that we undertake ;
For we can neither meet with Clay nor Awdrey ,
The Chanon Hugh , nor Turfe the Constable :
We are like Men that wander in strange Woods ,
And lose our selves in search of them we seek .
This was because we rose on the wrong side ;
But as I am now here , just in the mid-way ,
I 'll zet my Sword on the Pommel , and that line
The point valls to , we 'll take : whether it be
To Kentish-town , the Church , or Home again .
Stay , stay thy Hand : here 's Justice Bramble 's
Enter Metaphor .
Clerk ,
The unlucky Hare hath crost us all this day .
I 'll stand aside whilst thou pump 'st out of him
His Business , Hilts ; and how he 's now employed .
Let me alone , I 'll use him in his kind .
Oh , for a Pad-horse , Pack-horse , or a Post-horse ,
To bear me on his Neck , his Back , or his Crup !
I am as weary with running , as a Mill-horse
That hath led the Mill once , twice , thrice about ,
After the breath hath been out of his Body .
I could get up upon a Pannier , a Pannel ,
Or , to say truth , a very Pack-Saddle ,
Till all my Honey were turn 'd into Gall ,
And I could sit in the Seat no longer :
Oh the Legs of a Lackey now , or a Foot-man ,
Who is the Surbater of a Clerk currant ,
And the Confounder of his tressless Dormant !
But who have we here , just in the nick ?
I am neither nick , nor in the nick : therefore
You lye , Sir Metaphor .
Lye ?
how ?
Lye so , Sir .
I lye not yet i' my throat .
Thou ly 'st o ' the ground .
Do 'st thou know me ?
Yes , I did know you too late .
What is my Name then ?
Basket ?
what ?
Basket , the Great ? ?
The Great ?
what ?
Lubber ? ? ?
I should say , Lover , of the Squire , his Master .
Great is my patience , to forbear thee thus ,
Thou Scrape-hill , Scoundrel , and thou skum of Man ;
Uncivil , orenge-tawny-coated Clerk :
Thou cam 'st but half a thing into the world ,
And wast made up of patches , parings , shreds :
Thou , that when last thou wert put out of Service ,
Travelled 'st to Hamsted-Heath , on an Ash-we 'nesday ,
Where thou didst stand six weeks the Jack of Lent ,
For Boys to hurle , three throws a penny , at thee ,
To make thee a Purse : Seest thou this , bold bright blade ?
This Sword shall shred thee as small unto the Grave ,
As minc 'd meat for a Pie .
I 'll set thee in Earth
All , save thy Head , and thy Right Arm at liberty ,
To keep thy Hat off , while I question thee ,
What ?
why ?
and whither thou wert going now ,
With a Face , ready to break out with business ?
And tell me truly , lest I dash't in pieces .
Then , Basket , put thy Smiter up , and hear ;
I dare not tell the Truth to a drawn Sword .
' Tis sheath 'd , stand up , speak without fear or wit .
I know not what they mean ; but Constable
Turfe
Sends here his Key , for Moneys in his Cubbard ,
Which he must pay the Captain that was robb 'd
This Morning .
Smell you nothing ?
No, not I :
Thy Breeches yet are honest .
As my Mouth .
Do you not smell a Rat ?
I tell you truth ,
I think all 's Knavery : For the Chanon whisper 'd
Me in the Ear , when Turfe had gi'n me his Key ,
By the same token to bring Mrs. Awdrey ,
As sent for thither ; and to say , John Clay
Is found , which is indeed to get the Wench
Forth for my Master , who is to be married
When she comes there : The Chanon has his Rules
Ready , and all there , to dispatch the matter .
Now on my life , this is the Chanon 's plot !
Miles , I have heard all thy discourse to Basket .
Wilt thou be true , and I 'll reward thee well ,
To make me happy , in my Mistris Awdrey ?
Your Worship shall dispose of Metaphor ,
Through all his parts , e 'en from the sole o ' the Head ,
To the Crown o ' the Foot , to manage of your service .
Then do thy Message to the Mistris Turfe ,
Tell her thy token , bring the Money hither ,
And likewise take young Awdrey to thy charge :
Which done , here , Metaphor , we will attend ,
And intercept thee .
And for thy Reward ,
You two shall share the Money , I the Maid :
If any take offence , I 'll make all good .
But shall I have half the Money , Sir , in faith ?
I , on my Squire-ship , shalt thou : and my Land .
Then , if I make not , Sir , the clenliest scuse
To get her hither , and be then as careful
To keep her for you , as't were for my self ,
Down o ' your knees , and pray that honest Miles
May break his Neck ere he get o 'er two Stiles .
MAke haste then : we will wait here thy re -
This luck unlook 'd for , hath reviv 'd my hopes ,
Which were opprest with a dark melancholy .
In happy time , we linger 'd on the way ,
To meet these Summons of a better sound ,
Which are the Essence of my Soul 's Content .
This heartless fellow ; shame to Serving-men ;
Stain of all Liveries ; what Fear makes him do !
How sordid , wretched , and unworthy things ;
Betray his Masters Secrets , ope ' the Closet
Of his Devices , force the foolish Justice ,
Make way for your Love , plotting of his own :
Like him that digs a Trap , to catch another ,
And falls into 't himself !
So wou 'd I have it ;
And hope 'twill prove a Jest to twit the Justice with .
But that this poor white-liver 'd Rogue should do 't ?
And meerly out of fear ?
And hope of Money , Hilts .
A valiant Man will nibble at that Bait .
Who , but a Fool , will refuse Money proffer 'd ?
And sent by so good chance .
Pray Heaven he
If he come empty-handed , let him count
To go back empty-headed ; I 'll not leave him
So much of Brain in 's Pate , with Pepper and Vinegar ,
To be serv 'd in for Sawce to a Calves Head .
Thou serv 'st him rightly , Hilts .
I 'll seal as much
With my Hand , as I dare say now with my Tongue ;
But if you get the Lass from Dargison ,
What will you do with her ?
We 'll think o ' that
When once we have her in possession , Governour .
YOu see we trust you , Mr. Metaphor ,
With Mrs. Awdrey : 'pray you , use her well ,
As a Gentlewoman should be us 'd .
For my part ,
I do incline a little to the Serving-man ;
We have been of a Coat ? ?
I had one like yours :
Till it did play me such a sleeveless Errand ,
As I had nothing where to put mine Arms in ,
And then I threw it off .
Pray you , go before her ,
Serving-man-like , and see that your Nose drop not .
As for example , you shall see me : Mark ,
How I go a-fore her : So do you .
Sweet Miles ,
She , for her own part , is a Woman cares not
What Man can do unto her , in the way
Of Honesty , and good Manners .
So farewel ,
Fair Mrs. Awdrey : Farewel , Mr. Miles .
I ha' brought you thus far , onward o ' your way :
I must go back now to make clean the Rooms ,
Where my good Lady has been .
Pray you commend me
To
To Bridegroom Clay ; and bid him bear up stiff .
Thank you , good Hannibal Puppy ; I shall fit
The Leg of your Commands , with the straight Buskins
Of dispatch presently .
Farewel , fine Metaphore .
Come , gentle Mistris , will you please to walk ?
I love not to be led : I 'd go alone .
Let not the Mouse of my good meaning , Lady ,
Be snap 'd up in the Trap of your Suspicion ,
To lose the Tail there , either of her Truth ,
Or swallow 'd by the Cat of Misconstruction .
You are too finical for me ; speak plain , Sir .
WElcome again , my Awdrey : welcome , Love :
You shall with me ; in faith deny me not .
I cannot brook the second hazard , Mistris .
Forbear , Squire Tub , as mine own Mother says ,
I am not for your mowing .
You 'll be flown
Ere I be fledg 'd .
Hast thou the Money , Miles ?
Here are two Bags , there 's Fifty Pound in each .
Nay , Awdrey , I possess you for this time :
Sirs , take that Coyn between you , and divide it .
My pretty Sweeting , give me now the leave
To challenge Love , and Marriage at your hands .
Now , out upon you , are you not asham 'd ?
What will my Lady say ?
In faith , I think
She was at our House : and I think she ask 'd for you :
And I think she hit me i' th ' teeth with you ,
I thank her Ladyship : and I think she means
Not to go hence , till she has found you .
How say you ?
Was then my Lady Mother at your House ?
Let 's have a word aside .
Yes , Twenty words .
' Tis strange , a Motion , but I know not what ,
Comes in my mind , to leave the way to Totten ,
And turn to Kentish-town , again my Journey :
And see my Son , Pol-martin , with his Awdrey :
Ere while we left her at her Father 's House :
And hath he thence remov 'd her in such haste !
What shall I do ?
Shall I speak fair , or chide ?
Madam , your worthy Son , with dutious care ,
Can govern his Affections : Rather than
Break off their Conference , some other way ,
Pretending ignorance of what you know .
And this all , fair Awdrey : I am thine .
Mine you were once , though scarcely now
your own .
' Slid , my Lady ! my Lady !
Is this my Lady bright ?
Madam , you took me now a little tardy .
At Prayers , I think you were : What , so devout
Of late , that you will shrive you to all Confessors
You meet by chance ?
Come , go with me , good Squire ,
And leave your Linnen : I have now a business ,
And of importance , to impart unto you .
Madam , I pray you , spare me but an hour ;
Please you to walk before , I follow you .
It must be now , my business lies this way .
Will not an hour hence , Madam , excuse me ?
Squire , these Excuses argue more your Guilt .
You have some new Device now , to project ,
Which the poor Tile-man scarce will thank you for .
What ?
will you go ?
I ha' tane a charge upon me ,
To see this Maid conducted to her Father ,
Who , with the Chanon Hugh , stays her at Pancras ,
To see her married to the same John Clay .
' Tis very well : but , Squire , take you no care .
I 'll send Pol martin with her , for that Office :
You shall along with me ; it is decreed .
I have a little business with a friend , Madam .
That friend shall stay for you , or you for him .
Pol-martin , take the Maiden to your care :
Commend me to her Father .
I will follow you .
Tut , tell not me of following .
I 'll but speak a word .
No whispering : you forget your self ,
And make your Love too palpable : A Squire ?
And think so meanly ?
fall upon a Cow-shard ?
You know my mind .
Come , I 'll to Turfe 's House ,
And see for Dido , and our Valentine .
Pol-martin , look to your charge ; I 'll look to mine .
and Awdrey .
I smile to think , after so many profers
This Maid hath had , she now should fall to me :
That I should have her in my custody :
' Twere but a mad trick to make the Essay ,
And jump a Match with her immediately :
She 's fair and handsome ; and she 's rich enough :
Both time and place minister fair occasion .
Have at it then : Fair Lady , can you love ?
No Sir : What 's that ?
A Toy which Women use .
If't be a Toy , it 's good to play withal .
We will not stand discoursing o ' the Toy :
The way is short , please you to prov't , Mistris ?
If you do mean to stand so long upon it .
I pray you let me give it a short cut , Sir .
It 's thus , fair Maid ; Are you dispos 'd to marry ?
You are dispos 'd to ask .
Are you to grant ?
Nay , now I see you are dispos 'd indeed .
I see the Wench wants but a little Wit ;
And that Defect , her Wealth may well supply ;
In plain terms , tell me , Will you have me , Awdrey ?
In as plain terms , I tell you who would ha' me .
John Clay would ha' me , but he hath too hard Hands ;
I like not him : Besides , he is a Thief .
And Justice Bramble , he would fain ha' catch 'd me :
But the young Squire , he , rather than his life ,
Would ha' me yet ; and make me a Lady , he says ,
And be my Knight ; to do me true Knights service ,
Before his Lady Mother .
Can you make me
A Lady , would I ha' you ?
I can gi' you
A Silken Gown , and a Rich Petticoat :
And a French Hood .
All Fools love to be brave :
I find her Humour , and I will pursue it .
ANd , as I told thee , she was intercepted
By the Squire , here , my Son , and this bold
Ruffian ,
His Man ; who safely would have carried her
Unto her Father , and the Chanon Hugh :
But for more care of the Security ,
My Huisher hath her now in his grave charge .
Now on my Faith , and holy-dom , we are
Beholden to your Worship .
She 's a Girl ,
A foolish Girl , and soon may tempted be :
But if this day pass well once o 'er her Head ,
I 'll wish her trust to her self .
For I have been
A very Mother to her , though I say it .
Madam , 'tis late , and Pancridge is i' your way :
I think your Ladyship forgets your self .
Your mind runs much on Pancridge .
Well ,
young Squire ,
The black Oxe never trod yet o ' your foot :
These idle Phant 'sies will forsake you one day .
Come ,
Come , Mrs. Turfe , will you go take a walk
Over the Fields to Pancridge , to your Husband ?
Madam , I had been there an hour ago :
But that I waited on my Man Ball Puppy .
What , Ball , I say ?
I think the idle Slouch
Be fall 'n asleep i' the Barn , he stays so long .
Sattin , i' the name of Velvet-Sattin , Dame !
The Devil ! O the Devil is in the Barn :
Help , help , a Legion ? ?
Spirit-Legion
Is in the Barn ! in every Straw a Devil .
Why do 'st thou bawl so , Puppy ?
Speak , what
ails thee ?
My Name 's Ball Puppy , I ha' seen the Devil
Among the Straw : O for a Cross ! a Collop
Of Friar Bacon , or a conjuring stick
Of Doctor Faustus ! Spirits are in the Barn .
How ! Spirits in the Barn ?
Basket , go see .
Sir , an' you were my Master ten times over ,
And Squire to boot ; I know , and you shall pardon me :
Send me 'mong Devils ?
I zee you love me not :
Hell be at their Game : I 'll not trouble them .
Go see ; I warrant thee there 's no such matter .
An' they were Giants , 'twere another matter .
But Devils ! No, if I be torn in pieces ,
What is your Warrant worth ?
I 'll see the Fiend
Set fire o ' the Barn , ere I come there .
Now all Zaints bless us , and if he be there ,
He is an ugly Spright , I warrant .
As ever
Held Flesh-hook , Dame , or handled Fire-fork rather :
They have put me in a sweet pickle , Dame :
But that my Lady Valentine smells of Musk ,
I should be asham 'd to press into this presence .
Basket , I pray thee see what is the Miracle !
Come , go with me : I 'll lead .
Why stand 'st
thou , Man ?
Cocks precious , Master , you are not mad indeed ?
You will not go to Hell before your time ?
Why art thou thus afraid ?
No, not afraid :
But by your leave , I 'll come no near the Barn .
Puppy ! wilt thou go with me ?
How ?
go with you ?
Whither , into the Barn ?
To whom , the Devil ?
Or to do what there ?
to be torn 'mongst 'um ?
Stay for my Master , the High Constable ,
Or In-and-In , the Head-borough ; let them go
Into the Barn with Warrant ; seize the Fiend ;
And set him in the Stocks for his ill rule :
' Tis not for me that am but Flesh and Blood ,
To meddle with 'un .
Vor I cannot , nor I wu ' not .
I pray thee , Tripoly , look , what is the matter ?
That shall I , Madam .
Heaven protect my Master .
I tremble every joynt till he be back .
Now , now , even now they are tearing him in
pieces ,
Now are they tossing of his Legs and Arms ,
Like Loggets at a Pear-tree : I 'll to the hole ,
Peep in , and look whether he lives or dies .
I would not be i' my Masters Coat for Thousands .
Then pluck it off , and turn thy self away .
O the Devil ! the Devil ! the Devil !
Where , Man ?
where ?
Alas , that ever we were born .
So near too ?
The Squire hath him in his hand , and leads him
Out by the Collar .
O , this is John Clay .
John Clay at Pancrace , is there to be married .
This was the Spirit revell 'd i' the Barn .
The Devil he was : was this he was crawling
Among the Wheat-straw ?
Had it been the Barley ,
I should ha'tane him for the Devil in drink ;
The Spirit of the Bride-Ale : But , poor John ,
Tame John of Clay , that sticks about the Bung-hole ?
If this be all your Devil , I would take
In hand to conjure him : But hell take me ,
If ere I come in a right Devil 's walk ,
If I can keep me out on't .
Well meant , Hilts .
But how came Clay thus hid here i' the Straw ,
When news was brought , to you all , he was at Pancridge ;
And you believ 'd it ?
Justice Bramble 's Man
Told me so , Madam : And by that same token ,
And other things , he had away my Daughter ,
And two seal 'd Bags of Money .
Where 's the Squire :
Is he gone hence ?
H' was here , Madam , but now .
Is the Hue and Cry past by ?
I , I , John Clay .
And am I out of danger to be hang 'd ?
Hang 'd , John ?
yes , sure ; unless , as with the
Proverb ,
You mean to make the choice of your own Gallows .
Nay , then all 's well , hearing your news , Ball
Puppy ,
You ha' brought from Paddington , I e 'en stole home here ,
And thought to hide me in the Barn ere since .
O wonderful ! and news was brought us here ,
You were at Pancridge , ready to be married .
No, faith , I ne 'er was further than the Barn .
Haste , Puppy .
Call forth Mistris Dido Wispe ,
My Ladies Gentlewoman , to her Lady ;
And call your self forth , and a Couple of Maids ,
To wait upon me : we are all undone !
My Lady is undone ! her fine young Son ,
The Squire , is got away .
Haste , haste , good Valentine .
And you , John Clay ; you are undone too
All !
My Husband is undone , by a true Key ,
But a false Token : And my self 's undone ,
By parting with my Daughter , who 'll be married
To some Body , that she should not , if we haste not .
IPray thee , good Pol-martin , shew thy diligence ,
And , faith , in both : Get her but so disguis 'd ,
The Chanon may not know her , and leave me
To plot the rest : I will expect thee here .
You shall , Squire .
I 'll perform it with all care ,
If all my Ladies Ward-robe will disguise her .
Come , Mistris Awdrey .
Is the Squire gone ?
He 'll meet us by and by , where he appointed :
You shall be brave anon , as none shall know you .
IWonder where the Queens High Constable is !
I vear they ha' made 'un away .
No zure ; the Justice
Dare not conzent to that .
He 'll zee 'un forth coming .
He must , vor we can all take Corpulent Oath ,
We zaw 'un go in there .
I , upon Record !
The Clock dropt Twelve at Maribone .
You are right , D'oge !
Zet down to a minute , now 'tis a 'most vowre .
Here comes Squire Tub .
And 's Governour , Mr. Basket
Hilts , do you know 'un , a valiant wise vellow !
Az tall a Man on his Hands , as goes on veet .
Bless you , Mass' Basket .
Thank you , good D'oge .
Who 's that ?
D'oge Scriben , the great Writer , Sir , of Chalcot .
And , who the rest ?
The wisest Heads o ' the Hundred .
Medlay the Joyner , Head-borough of Islington ,
Pan of Belsize , and Clench , the Leach of Hamsted ,
The High Constables Counsel , here , of Finsbury .
Prezent me to 'em , Hilts , Squire Tub of Totten .
Wise Men of Finsbury , make place for a Squire ,
I bring to your acquaintance , Tub of Totten .
Squire Tub , my Master , loves all Men of Vertue ,
And longs ( as one would zay ) till he be one on you .
His Worship 's wel'cun to our Company :
Would 't were wiser for 'un .
Here be some on us ,
Are call 'd the Witty Men , over a Hundred .
And zome a Thousand , when the Muster-day
I long ( as my Man Hilts said , and my Governour )
To be adopt in your Society .
Can any Man make a Masque here i' this Company ?
A Masque ! what 's that ?
A Mumming , or a Shew ,
With Vizards and fine Clothes .
A Disguise , Neighbour ,
Is the true word : There stands the Man can do 't , Sir :
Medlay the Joyner , In-and-In of Islington ,
The only Man at a Disguise in Middlesex .
But who shall write it ?
Scriben , the great Writer .
He 'll do 't alone , Sir ; he will joyn with no man :
Though he be a Joyner , in design he calls it ,
He must be sole Inventer : In-and-In
Draws with no other in 's Project , he 'll tell you ,
It cannot else be feazeable , or conduce :
Those are his ruling words ?
Pleaze you to hear 'un ?
Yes , Mr. In-and-In , I have heard of you .
I can do nothing , I.
He can do all , Sir .
They 'll tell you so .
I'ld have a Toy presented ,
A Tale of a Tub , a Story of my self ,
You can express a Tub .
If it conduce
To the Design , whate 'er is feazeable :
I can express a Wash-house ( if need be ) ,
With a whole Pedigree of Tubs .
No, one
Will be enough to note our Name and Family :
Squire Tub of Totten , and to shew my Adventures
This very day .
I'ld have it in Tubs-Hall ,
At Totten-Court , my Lady Mothers House ;
My House indeed ; for I am Heir to it .
If I might see the place , and had survey 'd it ,
I could say more : For all Invention , Sir ,
Comes by degrees , and on the view of Nature ,
A world of things concur to the design ,
Which make it feazible , if Art conduce .
You say well , witty Mr. In-and-In .
How long ha' you studied , Ingine ?
Since I first
Joyn 'd , or did in-lay in Wit , some vorty year .
A pretty time ! Basket , go you and wait
On Master In-and-In , to Totten-Court ,
And all the other wise Masters : Shew 'em the Hall :
And taste the Language of the Buttery to 'em :
Let 'em see all the Tubs about the House ,
That can raise Matter , till I come ?
which shall be
Within an Hour , at least .
It will be glorious ,
If In-and-In will undertake it , Sir :
He has a monstrous Medlay Wit o ' his own .
Spare for no cost , either in Boards or Hoops ,
To architect your Tub : Ha' you ne 'er a Cooper
At London , call 'd Vitruvius ?
Send for him ;
Or old John Haywood , call him to you , to help .
He scorns the Motion , trust to him alone .
O , Here 's the Squire ! you slipp 'd us finely , Son !
These Manners to your Mother , will com-
mend you ;
But in another Age , not this : Well , Tripoly ,
Your Father , good Sir Peter , ( rest his Bones )
Would not ha' done this : Where 's my Huisher Martin ?
And your fair Mrs. Awdrey ?
I not see 'em ,
No Creature , but the Four Wise Masters here ,
Of Finsbury Hundred , came to cry their Constable ,
Who , they do say , is lost .
My Husband lost ?
And my fond Daughter lost ?
I fear me too .
Where is your Gentleman , Madam ?
Poor John Clay ,
Thou hast lost thy Awdrey .
I ha' lost my Wits ,
My little Wits , good Mother ; I am distracted .
And I have lost my Mistris Dido Wispe ,
Who frowns upon her Puppy , Hannibal .
Loss ! loss on every side ! a publick loss !
Loss o ' my Master ! loss of his Daughter ! loss
Of Favour , Friends , my Mistris ! loss of all !
What Cry is this ?
My Man speaks of some loss .
My Master is found : Good luck , and't be thy will ,
Light on us all .
O Husband , are you alive ?
They said you were lost .
Where 's Justice Bramble 's Clerk ?
Had he the Money that I sent for ?
Yes ,
Two Hours ago , two Fifty Pounds in Silver ,
And Awdrey too .
Why Awdrey ?
who sent for her ?
You , Master Turfe , the Fellow said .
He lyed .
I am cozen 'd , robb 'd , undone : Your Man 's a Thief ,
And run away with my Daughter , Mr. Bramble ,
And with my Money .
Neighbour Turfe , have patience ,
I can assure you that your Daughter is safe ,
But for the Monies , I know nothing of .
My Money is my Daughter , and my Daughter
She is my Money , Madam .
I do wonder
Your Ladyship comes to know any thing
In these affairs .
Yes , Justice Bramble ,
I met the Maiden i' the Fields by chance ,
I ' the Squire 's Company , my Son : How he
Lighted upon her , himself best can tell .
I intercepted her , as coming hither ,
To her Father , who sent for her , by Miles Metaphor ,
Justice Preamble 's Clerk .
And had your Ladyship
Not hindred it , I had paid fine Mr. Justice ,
For his young Warrant , and new Purs'yvant ,
He serv 'd it by this morning .
Know you that , Sir ?
You told me , Squire , a quite other Tale ,
But I believ 'd you not , which made me send
Awdrey another way , by my Pol-martin :
And take my Journey back to Kentish-town ,
Where we found John Clay hidden i' the Barn ,
To scape the Hue and Cry : and here he is .
John Clay agen ! nay , then ?
set Cock a hoop :
I ha' lost no Daughter , nor no Money , Justice .
John
John Clay shall pay .
I 'll look to you now , John . |
Vaith , out it must , as good at night as morning .
I am e 'en as vull as a Piper 's Bag , with Joy ;
Or a great Gun upon Carnation-day !
I could weep Lyons Tears to see you , John .
' Tis but two vifty pounds I ha' ventur 'd for you :
But now I ha' you , you shall pay whole hundred .
Run from your Burroughs , Son ! Faith , e 'en be hang 'd .
An' you once earth your self , John , i' the Barn ,
I ha' no Daughter vor you : Who did verret 'un ?
My Ladies Son , the Squire here , vetch 'd
'un out .
Puppy had put us all in such a vright ,
We thought the Devil was i' the Barn ; and no body
Durst venture o ' 'un .
I am now resolv 'd
Who shall ha' my Daughter .
Who ?
He best deserves her .
Here comes the Vicar .
Chanon Hugh , we ha' vound
John Clay agen ! the matter 's all come round .
IS Metaphor return 'd yet ?
All is turn 'd
Here to confusion : We ha' lost our Plot ;
I fear my Man is run away with the Money ,
And Clay is found , in whom old Turfe is sure
To save his Stake .
What shall we do then , Justice ?
The Bride was met i' the young Squire 's hands .
And what 's become of her ?
None here can tell .
Was not my Mothers Man , Pol-martin , with you ?
And a strange Gentlewoman in his company ,
Of late here , Chanon ?
Yes , and I -dispatch 'd 'em .
Dispatch 'd 'em ! how do you mean ?
Why , married 'em .
As they desir 'd ; but now .
And do you know
What you ha' done , Sir Hugh ?
No harm , I hope .
You have ended all the Quarrel : Awdrey is
Married ! to whom ?
My Daughter Awdrey married ,
And she not know of it !
Nor her Father , or Mother !
Whom hath she married ?
Your Pol-martin , Madam .
A Groom was never dreamt of .
Is he a Man ?
That he is , Turfe , and a Gentleman , I ha' made
Nay , an' he be a Gentleman , let her shift .
She was so brave , I knew her not , I swear ;
And yet I married her by her own name .
But she was so disguis 'd , so Lady-like ,
I think she did not know her self the while !
I married 'em as a meer pair of strangers :
And they gave out themselves for such .
I wish 'em
Much Joy , as they have given me hearts ease .
Then , Madam , I 'll intreat you now remit
Your Jealousie of me ; and please to take
All this good Company home with you to Supper :
We 'll have a merry night of it , and laugh .
A right good motion , Squire ; which I yield to :
And thank them to accept it .
Neighbour Turfe ,
I 'll have you merry , and your Wife : And you ,
Sir Hugh , be pardo n 'd this your happy Error .
By Justice Preamble , your Friend and Patron .
If the young Squire can pardon it , I do .
STay , my dear Dido , and good Vicar Hugh ,
We have a business with you : In short , this ,
If you dare knit another pair of Strangers ,
Dido , of Carthage , and her Countrey-man ,
Stout Hannibal stands to't .
I have ask 'd consent ,
And she hath granted .
But saith Dido so ?
From what Ball-Hanny hath said , I dare not go .
Come in then , I 'll dispatch you .
A good
Supper
Would not be lost , good Company , good Discourse ;
But above all , where Wit hath any source .
AFter the hoping of your pardon , Madam ,
For many Faults committed .
Here my Wife ,
And I do stand , expecting your mild Doom .
I wish thee Joy , Pol-martin ; and thy Wife
As much , Mrs. Pol-martin .
Thou hast trick 'd her
Up very fine , me thinks .
For that , I made
Bold with your Ladyships Wardrobe , but have tres -
pass 'd
Within the limits of your leave ? ?
I hope .
I give her what she wears .
I know all Women
Love to be fine .
Thou hast deserv 'd it of me :
I am extreamly pleas 'd with thy good Fortune .
Welcome , good Justice Preamble ; And Turfe ,
Look merrily on your Daughter : She has married
A Gentleman .
So me thinks .
I dare not touch her ,
She is so fine : yet I will say , God bless her .
And I too , my fine Daughter .
I could
love her
Now , twice as well , as if Clay had her .
Come , come , my Mother is pleas 'd : I pardon all .
Pol-martin , in , and wait upon my Lady .
Welcome good Guests : see Supper be serv 'd in ,
With all the Plenty of the House , and Worship .
I must confer with Mr. In-and-In ,
About some Alterations in my Masque :
Send Hilts out to me ; Bid him bring the Council
Of Finsbury hither .
I 'll have such a night
Shall make the Name of Totten-Court Immortal :
And be Recorded to Posterity .
OMr. In-and-In , what ha' you done ?
Survey 'd the Place , Sir , and design 'd
the Ground ,
Or stand still of the work : And this it is .
First , I have fixed in the Earth , a Tub ;
And an old Tub , like a Salt-Petre-Tub ,
Preluding by your Father 's Name , Sir Peter .
And the Antiquity of your House and Family ,
Original from Salt-Petre .
Good yfaith ,
You ha' shewn Reading , and Antiquity here , Sir .
I have a little knowledge in design ,
Which I can vary , Sir , to Infinito .
Ad Infinitum , Sir , you mean .
I do .
I stand not on my Latine , I 'll invent ;
But I must be alone then , joyn 'd with no Man .
This we do call the Stand-still of our work .
Y y y Tub .
Who are those we , you now joyn 'd to your self ?
I mean my self still , in the Plural Number ,
And out of this we raise our Tale of a Tub .
No, Mr. In-and-In , my Tale of a Tub ,
By your leave , I am Tub , the Tale 's of me ,
And my Adventures ! I am Squire Tub ,
Subjectum Fabul? .
But I the Author .
The Workman , Sir ! the Artificer ! I grant you .
So Skelton-Laureat , was of Elinour Bumming ;
But she the Subject of the Rout and Tunning .
He has put you to it , Neighbour In-and-In .
Do not dispute with him , he still will win .
That pays for all .
Are you revis 'd o ' that ?
A Man may have Wit , and yet put off his Hat .
Now , Sir , this Tub , I will have capt with Paper :
A fine Oyl 'd Lantern-paper , that we use .
Yes , every Barber , every Cutler has it .
Which in it doth contain the light to the business .
And shall with the very Vapour of the Candle ,
Drive all the motions of our Matter about :
As we present 'em .
For Example , first ,
The Worshipful Lady Tub .
Right Worshipful ,
I pray you , I am Worshipful my self .
Your Squireship 's Mother , passeth by ( her Huisher ,
Mr. Pol-martin , bare-headed before her )
In her Velvet Gown .
But how shall the Spectators ,
As it might be , I , or Hilts , know 'tis my Mother ?
Or that Pol-martin , there , that walks before her .
O we do nothing , if we clear not that .
You ha' seen none of his Works , Sir ?
All the postures
Of the Train 'd Bands o ' the Countrey .
All their Colours .
And all their Captains .
All the Cries o ' the City :
And all the Trades i' their Habits .
He has his Whistle
Of Command : Seat of Authority !
And Virge to interpret , tip 'd with Silver , Sir ,
You know not him .
Well , I will leave all to him .
Give me the brief o ' your Subject .
Leave the
whole
State of the thing to me .
Supper is ready , Sir .
My Lady calls for you .
I 'll send it you in writing .
Sir , I will render feazible , and facile ,
What you expect .
Hilts , be 't your care ,
To see the Wise of Finsbury made welcome :
Let 'em want nothing .
Is old Rosin sent for ?
He 's come within .
Lord ! what a world of business
The Squire dispatches ! Med .
He is a learned Man :
I think there are but vew o ' the Inns o ' Court ,
Or the Inns o ' Chancery like him .
Care to fit 'un then .
YOnder 's another Wedding , Master Basket ,
Brought in by Vicar Hugh .
What are they , Jack ?
The High Constable 's Man , Ball Hanny ; and
Mrs. Wispes ,
Our Ladies Woman .
And are the Table merry ?
There 's a young Tile-maker makes all laugh ;
He will not eat his Meat , but crys at th ' Board ,
He shall be hang 'd .
He has lost his Wench already :
As good be hang 'd .
Was she that is Pol-martin ,
Our Fellows Mistris , wench to that Sneak-John ?
I faith , Black Jack , he should have been her Bride-
groom :
But I must go to wait o ' my Wise Masters .
Jack , you shall wait on me , and see the Mask anon :
I am half Lord Chamberlain i' my Master 's absence .
Shall we have a Mask ?
Who makes it ?
The Master of Islington : Come , go with me
To the sage Sentences of Finsbury .
COme , give us in the great Chair , for my Lady ,
And set it there : and this for Justice Bramble .
This for the Squire my Master , on the right
And this for the High Constable .
This his Wife .
Then for the Bride and Bridegroom here , Pol-
And she Pol-martin , at my Ladies Feet .
And beside them Mr. Hannibal Puppy .
And his she Puppy , Mrs. VVispe that was :
Here 's all are in the Note .
No, Mr. Vicar :
The petty Chanon Hugh .
And Cast-by Clay :
There they are all .
Then cry a Hall , a Hall !
' Tis merry in Tottenham Hall , when Beards wag all .
Come , Father Rosin , with your Fiddle now ,
And two tall-toters : Flourish to the Masque .
All take
their Seats .
Hilts waits on the by .
NEighbours all welcome : Now doth Totten-Hall
Shew like a Court : And hence shall first be
call 'd so .
Your witty short Confession , Mr. Vicar ,
Within , hath been the Prologue , and hath open 'd
Much to my Son 's Device , his Tale of a Tub .
Let my Masque shew it self : And In-and-In ,
The Architect , appear : I hear the Whistle .
Thus rise I first , in my light Linnen Breeches ,
To run the meaning over in short Speeches .
Here is a Tub , a Tub of Totten-Court :
An ancient Tub , hath call 'd you to this sport :
His Father was a Knight , the rich Sir Peter ;
Who got his Wealth by a Tub , and by Salt-Petre :
And left all to his Lady Tub , the Mother
Of this bold Squire Tub , and to no other .
Now of this Tub , and 's Deeds , not done in Ale ,
Observe , and you shall see the very Tale .
The First Motion .
Loud Musick .
HEre Chanon Hugh first brings to Totten-Hall
The High Constable 's Council , tells the
Squire all ;
Which , though discover 'd ( give the Devil his due : )
The Wise of Finsbury do still pursue .
Then with the Justice doth he counterplot ,
And his Clerk Metaphor , to cut that knot :
Whilst Lady Tub , in her sad Velvet Gown ,
Missing her Son , doth seek him up and down .
With her Pol-martin bare before her .
Yes ,
I have exprest it here in Figure , and Mis -
tris VVispe , her Woman , holding up her Train .
I ' the next page , report your second Strain ,
The
The Second Motion .
Ha' peace .
Loud Musick .
Here the High Constable , and Sages walk
To Church , the Dame , the Daughter , Bride-maids talk
Of Wedding-business ; till a Fellow in comes ,
Relates the Robbery of one Captain Thum 's :
Chargeth the Bridegroom with it : Troubles all ,
And gets the Bride ; who in the Hands doth fall
Of the bold Squire ; but thence soon is tane
By the sly Justice , and his Clerk profane ,
In shape of Pursuyvant ; which he not long
Holds , but betrays all with his trembling Tongue :
As truth will break out , and shew , &c .
O , thou hast made him kneel there in a corner , |
I see now : There is simple Honour for you , Hilts !
Did I not make him to confess all to you ?
True , In-and-In hath done you right , you see .
Thy Third , I pray thee , witty In-and-In .
The Squire commends 'un .
He doth like all well .
He cannot chuse .
This is Gear made to sell .
The Third Motion .
Ha' peace .
Loud Musick .
The careful Constable , here drooping comes ,
In his deluded search of Captain Thum 's .
Puppy brings word , his Daughter 's run away
With the tall Serving-man .
He frights Groom Clay
Out of his Wits .
Returneth then the Squire ,
Mocks all their Pains , and gives Fame out a Lyar ,
For falsly charging Clay , when 'twas the Plot
Of subtle Bramble , who had Awdrey got ,
Into his hand , by his winding device .
The Father makes a Rescue in a trice :
And with his Daughter , like Saint George on foot ,
Comes home triumphing , to his dear Heart root .
And tells the Lady Tub , whom he meets there ,
Of her Son 's Courtesies , the Batchelor .
Whose words had made 'em fall the Hue and Cry .
When Captain Thum 's coming to ask him , why
He had so done ?
He cannot yield him cause :
But so he runs his Neck into the Laws .
The Fourth Motion .
Ha' peace .
Loud Musick .
The Laws , who have a Noose to crak his Neck ,
As Justice Bramble tells him , who doth peck
A Hundreth Pound out of his Purse , that comes
Like his Teeth from him , unto Captain Thum 's .
Thum 's is the Vicar in a false disguise :
And employs Metaphor to fetch this Prize .
Who tells the Secret unto Basket-Hilts ,
For fear of beating .
This the Squire quilts
Within his Cap ; and bids him but purloin
The Wench for him : They Two shall share the Coyn .
Which the sage Lady , in her 'foresaid Gown ,
Breaks off , returning unto Kentish-town ,
To seek her VVispe ; taking the Squire along ,
Who finds Clay John , as hidden in Straw throng .
O , how am I beholden to the Inventer ,
That would not , on Record , against me enter !
My slackness here , to enter in the Barn :
Well , In-and-In , I see thou canst discern !
On with your last , and come to a Conclusion .
The Fifth Motion .
Ha' peace .
Loud Musick
The last is known , and needs but small infusion
Into your Memories , by leaving in
These Figures , as you sit .
I , In-and-In ,
Present you with the Show : First , of a Lady
Tub , and her Son , of whom this Masque here , made I.
Then Bridegroom Pol , and Mistris Pol the Bride :
With the Sub-Couple , who sit them beside .
That only Verse I alter 'd for the better , eufonia
Then Justice Bramble , with Sir Hugh the Chanon :
And the Bride 's Parents , which I will not stan' on ,
Or the lost Clay , with the recovered Giles :
Who thus unto his Master , him 'conciles ,
On the Squire 's Word , to pay old Turfe his Club ,
And so doth end our Tale here , of a Tub .
