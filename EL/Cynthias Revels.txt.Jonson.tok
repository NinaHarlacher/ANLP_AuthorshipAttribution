' Tis I , blind Archer .
Who ?
Mercury ?
Stay , Cupid .
Not in your company , Hermes , except your
hands were rivetted at your Back .
Why so my little Rover ?
Because I know , you ha' not a Finger , but is as
long as my Quiver ( Cousin Mercury ) when you please
to extend it .
Whence derive you this Speech , Boy ?
O ! 'tis your best Polity to be ignorant .
You did
never steal Mars his Sword out of the Sheath , you ?
nor
Neptune 's Trident ?
nor Apollo 's Bow ?
no , not you ?
Alas , your Palms ( Jupiter knows ) they are as tender as
the Foot of a foundred Nag , or a Ladies Face new mer-
curied , they 'll touch nothing .
Go too ( Infant ) you 'll be daring stil .
Daring ?
O Janus ! what a word is there ?
why ,
my light Feather-heel 'd Couz , what are you ?
any more
than my Uncle Joves Pandar , a Lackquey that runs on
Errands for him , and can whisper a light Message
to a loose Wench with some round volubility , wait man-
nerly at a Table with a Trencher , and warble upon a
Crowd a little , fill out Nectar , when Ganimed 's away ,
one that sweeps the Gods Drinking-room every Morn -
ing , and sets the Cushions in order again , which they
threw one at anothers Head over-night , can brush the
Carpets , call the Stools again to their places , play the
Cryer of the Court with an audible Voice , and take
state of a President upon you at Wrestlings , Pleadings ,
Negotiations , &c .
Here 's the Catalogue o ' your Im -
ployments now , O no , I err , you have the marshaling
of all the Ghosts too that pass the Stygian Ferry , and I
suspect you for a a share with the old Sculler there , if
the truth were known ; but let that scape .
One other
peculiar vertue you possess , in lifting , or lieger-du-main ,
( which few of the House of Heav'n have else besides ) I
must confess .
But ( methinks ) that should not make
you put that extream distance 'twixt your self and o -
thers , that we should be said to over-dare in speaking to
your nimble Deity ?
So Hercules , might challenge Prio-
rity of us both , because he can throw the Bar farther ,
or lift more joyn 'd Stooles at the Arms end , than we .
If this might carry it , then we who have made the
whole Body of Divinity tremble at the twang of our
Bow , and enforc 'd Saturnius himself to lay by his curl 'd
Front , Thunder , and Three-fork 'd Fires , and put on a
masking Sute , too light for a Reveller of Eighteen , to
be seen in ? ? ?
How now ! my dancing braggart in decimo sexto!
charm your skipping Tongue , or I 'll ? ? ?
What ?
use the vertue of your snaky Tip-staff
there upon us ?
No, Boy , but the smart vigour of my Palm a -
bout your Ears .
You have forgot since I took your
Heels up into Air ( on the very hour I was born ) in
sight of all the Bench of Deities , when the Silver Roof
of the Olympyan Palace rung again with applause of the
O no , I remember it freshly , and by a particular
Instance ; for my Mother Venus ( at the same time ) but
stoopt to imbrace you , and ( to speak by metaphore )
you borrowed a Girdle of hers , as you did Joves Scep-
ter ( while he was laughing ) and would have done his
Thunder too , but that 'twas too hot for your itching
' Tis well , Sir .
I heard , you but look't in at Vulcans Forge the
other day , and intreated a pair of his new Tongs a -
long with you for company : Tis joy on you (y 'faith )
that you will keep your hook 'd Tallons in practice
with any thing .
' Slight , now you are on Earth , we
shall have you filch Spoons and Candlesticks rather than
fail : Pray Jove the perfum 'd Courtiers keep their Ca -
sting-bottles , Pick-tooths , and Shittle-cocks from you ;
or our more ordinary Gallants their Tabacco-boxes , for
I am strangely jealous of your Nails .
Ne 're trust me , Cupid , but you are turn 'd a most
acute Gallant of late , the Edg of my wit is clean taken
off with the fine and subtile stroke of your thin-ground
Tongue , you fight with too poinant a Phrase , for me to
deal with .
O Hermes , your Craft cannot make me confi-
I know my own Steel to be almost spent , and
therefore intreat my Peace with you , in time : you are
too cunning for me to Encounter at length , and I think
it my safest Ward to close .
Well , for once , I 'll suffer you to win upon me ,
wag , but use not the strains too often , they 'll stretch
my patience .
Whither might you march , now ?
Faith ( to recover thy good Thoughts ) I 'll disco-
ver my whole Project .
The Huntress and Queen of
these Groves , Diana ( in regard of some black and en-
vious slanders hourly breath 'd against her , for her di-
the full and royal expence of one of her clearest
Moons : In which time , it shall be lawful for all sorts
of ingenuous Persons , to visit her Palace , to court her
Nymphs , to exercise all variety of generous and noble
Pastimes , as well to intimate how far she treads such
malitious Imputations beneath her , as also to shew how
clear her Beauties are from the least wrinckle of Austeri-
ty they may be charg 'd with .
But , what is all this to Cupid ?
Here do I mean to put off the Title of a God ,
and take the Habit of a Page , in which disguise ( du-
ring the interim of these Revels ) I will get to follow
some one of Diana 's Maids , where ( if my Bow hold ,
and my Shafts fly but with half the willingness , and
aim they are directed ) I doubt not , but I shall really re -
deem the Minutes I have lost , by their so long and over-
nice Proscription of my Deity from their Court .
Pursue it ( divine Cupid ) it will be rare .
But will Hermes second me ?
I am now to put in act an especial designment
from my Father Jove , but that perform 'd , I am for any
fresh action that offers it self .
Well , then we part .
Farewel , good wagg .
Now to my charge , Eccho , fair Eccho , speak ,
' Tis Mercury that calls thee , sorrowful Nymph .
Salute me with thy repercussive Voice ,
That I may know what Cavern of the Earth
Contains thy airy Spirit , how , or where
I may direct my Speech , that thou maist hear ,
So nigh ?
Know ( gentle Soul ) then , I am sent from Jove ,
Who ( pittying the sad burthen of thy woes ,
Still growing on thee , in thy want of words ,
To vent thy passion for Narcissus death )
Commands , that now ( after Three thousand years ,
Which have been exercis 'd in Juno 's spight )
Thou take a Corporal Figure , and ascend ,
Enricht with vocal and articulate power .
Make haste , sad Nymph , thrice shall my winged Rod
Strike th ' obsequious Earth , to give thee way .
Arise , and speak thy Sorrows , Eccho , rise ,
Here , by this Fountain , where thy Love did pine ,
Whose memory lives fresh to vulgar fame ,
Shrin 'd in this yellow Flower , that bears his Name .
His name revives , and lifts me up from Earth .
O , which way shall I first convert my self ?
Or in what mood shall I essay to speak ,
That ( in a Moment ) I may be delivered
Of the prodigious grief I go withal ?
See , see , the mourning Fount , whose Springs weep yet
Th' untimely fate of that too beautious Boy ,
That Trophee of Self-love , and Spoyle of Nature ,
Who ( now transform 'd into this drooping flower )
Hangs the Repentant Head , back from the Stream ,
As if it wisht , would I had never look 'd
In such a flatt 'ring mirrour .
O Narcissus ,
Thou that wast once ( and yet are ) my Narcissus ;
Had Eccho but been private with thy thoughts ,
She would have dropt away her self in Tears ,
Till she had all turn 'd Water , that in her ,
( As in a truer Glass ) thou mightst have gaz 'd ,
And seen thy Beauties by more kind reflection
But Self-love never yet could look on Truth ,
But with bleard Beams ; slick Flattery and she
Are twin-born Sisters , and so mix their Eyes ,
As if you sever one , the other dyes .
Why did the Gods give thee a heav'nly form ,
And earthly thoughts , to make thee proud of it ?
Why , do I ask ?
' Tis now the known Disease
That Beauty hath , to bear too deep a sense
Of her own Self-conceived Excellence .
O , hadst thou known the worth of Heav'ns rich gift ,
Thou wouldst have turn 'd it to a truer use ,
And not ( with starv 'd , and covetous ignorance )
Pin 'd in continual eyeing that bright Gem ,
The glance whereof to others had been more ,
Than to thy famisht Mind the wide Worlds store :
" So wretched is it to be meerly rich .
Witness thy youths dear Sweets , here spent untasted ,
Like a fair Taper , with his own Flame wasted .
Eccho , be brief , Saturnia is abroad ,
And if she hear , she 'll storm at Joves high Will .
I will (kind Mercury ) be brief as Time .
Vouchsafe me , I may do him these last Rites ,
But kiss his flowr , and sing some mourning strain
Over his watry Hearse .
Thou dost obtain .
I were no Son to Jove , should I deny thee .
Begin , and ( more to grace thy cunning Voice )
The humorous Air shall mix her solemn Tunes ,
With thy sad words : strike Musick from the Sphears ,
And with your Golden Raptures swell our Ears .
S O N G.
SLow , slow , fresh Fount , keep time with my salt Tears ;
Yet slower , yet , O faintly gentle springs :
List to the heavy part the musick bears ,
" Woe weeps out her division , when she sings .
Droop herbs and flowres ;
Fall grief in showres ;
" Our beauties are not ours :
O , I could still
( Like melting snow upon some craggy hill ,
drop , drop , drop , drop ,
Since natures pride is , now , a wither 'd daffodill .
Now , ha' you done ?
Done presently ( good Hermes ) bide a little ,
Suffer thy thirsty Eye to gaze a while ,
But e 'en to taste the place , and I am vanisht .
Forgo thy use , and liberty of Tongue ,
And thou maist dwell on Earth , and sport thee there .
The weeping Niobe , translated hither
From Phrygian Mountains : any by Ph?be
rear 'd ,
As the proud Troph?e of her sharp revenge .
Nay , but hear .
But here , O here , the Fountain of Self-love ,
In which Latona , and her careless Nymphs ,
( Regardless of my sorrows ) bathe themselves
In hourly Pleasures .
Stint thy babling Tongue ;
Fond Eccho , thou prophan 'st the grace is done thee :
So idle Worldlings ( meerly made of voice )
Censure the Powers above them .
Come , away ,
Jove calls thee hence , and his will brooks no stay .
O , stay : I have but one poor Thought to clothe
In airy Garments , and then ( faith ) I go .
Henceforth , thou treacherous and murthering Spring ,
Be ever call 'd the Fountain of Self-love :
And with thy Water let this Curse remain ,
( As an inseparate Plague ) that who but tastes
A drop thereof , may , with the instant touch ,
Grow dotingly enamour 'd on themselves .
Now , Hermes , I have finisht .
Then thy Speech ,
Must here forsake thee , Eccho , and thy Voice
( As it was wont ) rebound but the last words .
Now , Cupid , I am for you , and your mirth ,
To make me light before I leave the Earth .
Stay , let me observe this Portent yet .
I am neither your Minotaure , nor your Centaure ,
nor your Satyre , nor your Hy?na , nor your Babion , but
your meer Traveler , believe me .
Leave me .
I guess 'd it should be some travelling motion
pursu 'd Eccho so .
Know you from whom you flye ?
or whence ?
This is somewhat above strange ! a Nymph of her
Feature and Lineament , to be so preposterously rude ! well ,
I will but cool my self at yon ' Spring , and follow her .
Nay , then I am familiar with the issue : I 'll leave
you too .
I am a Rhinoceros , if I had thought a Creature
of her symmetry , could have dar 'd so improportionable ,
and abrupt a digression .
Liberal , and divine Fount ,
suffer
suffer my prophane hand to take of thy Bounties .
By
the Purity of my taste , here is most ambrosiack Water ;
I will sup of it again .
By thy favour , sweet fount .
See , the Water ( a more running , subtile , and humo-
rous Nymph than she ) permits me to touch , and handle
What should I infer ?
If my Behaviours had been
of a cheap or customary garb ; my Accent or Phrase
vulgar ; my Garments trite ; my Countenance illite-
rate , or unpractis 'd in the incounter of a beautiful and
brave attir 'd Piece ; then I might ( with some change
of colour ) have suspected my Faculties : but know -
ing my self an essence so sublimated , and refin 'd by
travel ; of so studied , and well exercis 'd a Gesture ; so
alone in Fashion ; able to render the face of any States-
man living ; and so speak the meer extraction of Lan-
guage ; one that hath now made the sixth return upon
ventuer ; and was your first that ever inricht his Coun-
trey with the true Laws of the duello ; whose optiques
have drunk the spirit of Beauty , in some Eight score
and eighteen Princes Courts , where I have resided , and
been there fortunate in the amours of Three hundred
forty and five Ladies ( all Nobly , if not Princely de-
scended ) whose names I have in Catalogue ; to con-
clude , in all so happy , as even Admiration her self doth
seem to fasten her kisses upon me : Certes , I do neither
see , nor feel , nor taste , nor favour the least steam , or
fume of a reason , that should invite this foolish fastidi-
ous Nymph , so peevishly to abandon me .

I see he means not to write Verses
No, Crites ?
why ?
Because ? ?
Nec placere diu , nec vivere carmina
possunt , qu? scribuntur aqu? potoribus .
What say you to your Helicon ?
O , the Muses well ! that 's ever excepted .
Sir , your Muses have no such Water , I assure
you ; your Necter , or the juyce of your Nepenthe is no-
thing to it ; 'tis above your Metheglin , believe it .
Metheglin ! what 's that , Sir ?
may I be so audaci-
ous to demand ?
A kind of Greek Wine I have met with , Sir , in
my Travels ; it is the same that Demosthenes usually
drunk , in the composure of all his exquisite and melli-
fluous Orations .
That 's to be argued ( Amorphus ) if we may cre -
dit Lucian , who in his Encomio Demosthenis affirms , he
never drunk but Water in any of his compositions .
Lucian is absurd , he knew nothing : I will be-
lieve mine own Travels , before all the Lucians of Eu-
He doth feed you with fittons , figments , and
Indeed ( I think ) next a Traveller , he do 's pret-
tily well .
I assure you it was Wine , I have tasted it , and
from the hand of an Italian Antiquary , who derives it
authentically from the Duke of Ferrara 's Bottles .
How
name you the Gentleman you are in rank with there ,
Sir ?
' Tis Asotus , Son to the late deceas 'd Philargyrus
the Citizen .
Was his Father of any eminent place , or
means ?
He was to have been Pr?tor next year .
Ha ! A pretty formal young gallant , in good
sooth : pitty , he is not more gentilely propagated .
Hark you , Crites , you may say to him , what I am , if
you please : though I affect not popularity , yet I would
be loth to stand out to any , whom you shall vouchsafe
to call Friend .
Sir , I fear I may do wrong to your sufficiencies
in the reporting them , by forgetting or misplacing some
one ; your self can best enform him of your self , Sir :
except you had some catalogue , or list of your Facul-
ties ready drawn , which you would request me to shew
him for you , and him to take notice of .
This Crites is sowre : I will think , Sir .
Do so , Sir . O heaven ! that any thing ( in the
likeness of Man ) should suffer these rackt extremities , for
the uttering of his sophisticate good Parts .
Crites , I have a sute to you ; but you must not
deny me : pray you make this Gentleman and I friends .
Friends ! Why ?
is there any difference between
you ?
No, I mean acquaintance , to know one ano -
O , now I apprehend you ; your phrase was
without me before .
In good faith , he 's a most excellent rare Man ,
I warrant him !
' Slight , they are mutually enamour 'd by this
time !
Will you , sweet Crites ?
Yes , yes .
Nay , but when ?
you 'll defer it now , and for-
get it .
Why , is't a thing of such present necessity , that
it requires so violent a dispatch ?
No, but ( would I might never stir ) he 's a most
ravishing man ! good Crites , you shall endear me to you ,
in good faith-law .
Well , your longing shall be satisfied , Sir .
And withal , you may tell him what my Father
was , and how well he left me , and that I am his Heir .
Leave it to me , I 'll forget none of your dear
graces , I warrant you .
Nay , I know you can better marshal these Af -
fairs than I can ?
O Gods ! I 'd give all the world ( if
I had it ) for abundance of such acquaintance .
What ridiculous Circumstance might I devise
now , to bestow this reciprocal brace of Butter-flies one
upon another ?
Since I trode on this side the Alpes , I was not
so frozen in my Invention .
Let me see : to accost him
with some choice remnant of Spanish , or Italian ?
that
would indifferently express my languages now : mar-
ry then , if he should fall out to be ignorant , it were
both hard and harsh .
How else ?
step into some ra -
gioni del stato , and so make my induction ?
that were
above him too ; and out of his Element , I fear .
Feign
to have seen him in Venice or Padua ?
or some face neer
his in similitude ?
'tis too pointed , and open .
No, it
must be a more quaint , and collateral device .
As ?
stay : to frame some encomiastick Speech upon this our
Metropolis , or the wise Magistrates thereof , in which
politick number , 'tis odds , but his Father fill 'd up a
Room ?
descend into a particular admiration of their
Justice , for the due measuring of Coals , burning of
Cans , and such like ?
as also Religion , in pulling
down a superstitious Cross , and advancing a Venus , or
Priapus , in place of it ?
ha ?
'twill do well .
Or to talk
of some Hospital , whose Walls record his Father a
Benefactor ?
or of so many Buckets bestow 'd on his
Parish-church , in his life time , with his name at length
( for want of Arms ) trickt upon them ?
Any of these ?
Or to praise the cleanness of the Street , wherein he
dwelt ?
or the provident painting of his Posts against he
should have been Pr?tor ?
Or ( leaving his Parent ) come
to some special Ornament about himself , as his Rapier ,
or some other of his Accoutrements ?
I have it : Thanks ,
gracious Minerva .
K 2 Aso .
Would I had but once spoke to him , and
then ?
He comes to me .
' Tis a most curious , and neatly-wrought Band ,
this same , as I have seen Sir .
O God , Sir .
Amo , You forgive the humour of mine Eye , in ob -
serving it .
His Eye waters after it , it seems .
O Lord , Sir , there needs no such Apology , I as-
sure you .
I am anticipated : they 'll make a solemn deed of
gift of themselves , you shall see .
Your Ribband too do 's most gracefully , in troth .
' Tis the most gentile , and receiv 'd wear now ,
Believe me , Sir , ( I speak it not to humour you )
I have not seen a young Gentleman ( generally ) put on
his Cloaths with more judgment .
O , 'tis your pleasure to say so , Sir .
No, as I am vertuous ( being altogether un-
travel 'd ) it strikes me into wonder .
Aso , I do purpose to travel , Sir , at spring .
I think I shall affect you , Sir . This last speech
of yours hath begun to make you dear to me .
O God , Sir , I would there were any thing in
me , Sir , that might appear worthy the least worthiness
of your worth , Sir . I protest , Sir , I should endeavour
to shew it , Sir , with more than common regard , Sir .
O , here 's a rare motley , Sir .
Both your desert , and your endeavours are
plentiful , suspect them not : but your sweet disposition
to travel ( I assure you ) hath made you another my-self
in mine Eye , and struck me inamour 'd on your Beauties .
I would I were the fairest Lady of France for
your sake , Sir , and yet I would travel too .
O , you should digress from your self else : for
( believe it ) your travel is your only thing that rectifies ,
or ( as the Italian says ) vi rendi pronto all ' attioni , makes
you fit for action .
I think it be great charge though , Sir .
Charge ?
why 'tis nothing for a Gentleman
that goes private , as your self , or so ; my intelligence
shall quit my charge at all times .
Good faith , this Hat that
hath possest mine Eye exceedingly ; 'tis so pretty , and
fantastick : what ?
is't a Beaver ?
I , Sir , I 'll assure you 'tis a Beaver , it cost me
eight Crowns but this Morning .
After your French account ?
Yes , Sir .
And so near his head ?
beshrow me , dangerous .
A very pretty fashion ( believe me ) and a most
novel kind of trim : your Band is conceited too !
Sir , it is all at your service .
O , pardon me .
I beseech you , Sir , if you please to wear it , you
shall do me a most infinite grace .
' Slight , will he be prais 'd out of his Cloaths ?
By Heaven , Sir , I do not offer it you after the
Italian manner ; I would you should conceive so of me .
Sir , I shall fear to appear rude in denying your
courtesies , especially , being invited by so proper a di-
stinction : may I pray your Name Sir ?
My name is Asotus , Sir .
I take your love ( gentle Asotus ) but let me
win you to receive this , in exchange ?
They 'll change Doublets anon .
And ( from this time ) esteem your self , in the
first Rank , of those few , whom I profess to love .
What
make you in company of this Schollar , here ?
I will
bring you known Gallants , as Anaides of the Or-
dinary , Hedon the Courtier , and others , whose Society
shall render you grac 'd and respected : this is a trivial
Fellow , too mean , too cheap , too course for you to
converse with .
' Slid , this is not worth a Crown , and mine
cost me Eight but this Morning .
I lookt when he would repent him , he has be-
gun to be sad a good while .
Sir , shall I say to you for that Hat ?
be not so
sad , be not so sad : it is a Relick I could not so easily
have departed with , but as the Hieroglyphick of my af -
fection ; you shall alter it to what form you please , it
will take any block ; I have receiv 'd it varied ( on Re-
cord ) to the Three thousandth time , and not so few :
It hath these vertues beside ; your Head shall not ake un-
der it ; nor your Brain leave you , without licence ; It

I do entertain you , Cos, conceal your Quality
till we be private ; if your Parts be worthy of me , I

He will rank even with you ( er't be long )
If you hold on your course .
O vanity ,
How are thy painted beauties doted on ,
By light , and empty Idots ! how pursu 'd
With open and extended Appetite !
How they do sweat , and run themselves from breath ,
Rais 'd on their Toes , to catch thy airy Forms ,
Still turning giddy , till they reel like Drunkards ,
That buy the merry madness of one hour ,
With the long irksomness of following time !
O how despis 'd and base a thing is a Man ,
If he not strive t 'erect his groveling Thoughts
Above the strain of Flesh ! But how more cheap ,
When , even his best and understanding Part ,
( The crown and strength of all his Faculties )
Floats like a dead drownd Body , on the Stream
Of vulgar humour , mixt with common 'st dregs ?
I suffer for their Guilt now , and my Soul
( Like one that looks on ill-affected Eyes )
Is hurt with mere intention on their Follies .
Why will I view them then ?
my sense might ask me :
Or is't a rarity , or some new object ,
That strains my strict observance to this Point ?
O would it were , therein I could afford
My Spirit should draw a little neer to theirs ,

To gaze on novelties : so Vice were one .
Tut , she is stale , rank , foul , and were it not
That those ( that woo her ) greet her with lockt Eyes ,
( In spight of all the impostures , paintings , drugs ,
Which her Bawd custom dawbs her Cheeks withal )
She would betray her loath 'd and leprous Face ,
And fright th ' enamour 'd dotards from themselves :
But such is the perverseness of our nature ,
That if we once but fancy levity ,
( How antick and ridiculous so ere
It sute with us ) yet will our muffled thought
Choose rather not to see it , than avoid it :
And if we can but banish our own sense ,
We act our mimick tricks with that free license ,
That lust , that pleasure , that security ,
As if we practis 'd in a Paste-boad Case ,
And no one saw the motion , but the motion .

thou are a precious Deity .
Nay , Cupid , leave to speak improperly , since
we are turn 'd Cracks , let 's study to be like Cracks ;
practise their Language and Behaviours , and not with
a dead imitation : act freely , carelesly , and capriciously ,
as if our Veins ran with Quick-silver , and not utter a

That 's not every ones happiness ( Hermes ) though
you can presume upon the easiness and dexterity of

of mine : and not desperately to hazard it after your

O , no , that had been supererogation ; you shall
never hear your Courtier call but by one of these three .
Faith , then both our Fortunes are the same .
Why ?
what parcel of man hast thou lighted
on for a Master ?
Such a one ( as before I begin to decypher him )
I dare not affirm to be any thing less than a Courtier .
So much he is , during this open time of Revels , and
would be longer , but that his means are to leave him
shortly after .
His name is Hedon , a Gallant wholy con-

How is she call 'd , and then I can shew thee ?
Madam Philautia .
O I , he affects her very particularly indeed .
These are his Graces .
He doth ( besides me ) keep a
Barber and a Monky : He has a rich wrought Wastcoat
to entertain his Visitants in , with a Cap almost sutable .
His Curtains and Bedding are thought to be his own :
his Bathing-tub is not suspected .
He loves to have a
Fencer , a Pedant , and a Musician seen in his Lodging
And not a Poet ?
Fie no : himself is a Rimer , and that 's thought
better than a Poet .
He is not lightly within to his
Mercer , no , though he come when he takes Physick ,
which is commonly after his play .
He beats a Taylor
very well , but a Stocking-seller admirably : and so con-
sequently any one he owes Money to , that dares not
resist him .
He never makes general invitement , but a -
gainst the publishing of a new Sute ; marry then you
shall have more drawn to his Lodging , than come to
the lanching of some three Ships ; especially if he be
furnish 'd with Supplies for the retyring of his old Ward -
robe from pawn : if not , he do 's hire a stock of Appar-
rel , and some forty or fifty Pound in Gold , for that
Forenoon to shew .
He 's thought a very necessary per-
fume for the Presence , and for that only cause welcom
thither : six Milleners Shops afford you not the like
He courts Ladies with how many great Horse he
hath rid that Morning , or how oft he hath done the
whole , or the half pommado in a Seven-night before :
and sometime ventures so far upon the vertue of his Po-
mander , that he dares tell 'em , how many Shirts he has
sweat at Tennis that Week , but wisely conceals so many
dozen of Balls he is on the Score .
Here he comes , that
is all this .
Are any of the Ladyes in the presence ?
None yet , Sir .
Give me some Gold , more .
Is that thy Boy , Hedon ?
I , what think 'st thou of him ?
I'ld geld him ; I warrant he has the Philoso -
phers Stone .
Well said , my good melancholy Devil : Sirrah ,
I have devis 'd one or two of the prettiest Oaths ( this
morning in my Bed , ) as ever thou heard 'st , to protest
withal in the Presence .
Prythee , let 's hear 'em .
Soft , thou'lt use 'em afore me .
No, ( dam ' me then ) I have more Oaths than I
know how to utter , by this Air .
Faith , one is , by the tip of your Ear , sweet Lady .
Is't not pretty , and gentile ?
Yes , for the Person 'tis applyed to , a Lady .
It
should be light , and ? ?
Nay , the other is better , exceeds it much : the
invention is farther fet too .
By the white valley that lies
between the Alpine hills of your bosom , I protest ?
Well , you travel 'd for that , Hedon .
I , in a Map , where his Eyes were but blind
guides to his Understanding , it seems .
And then I have a salutation will nick all , by
this Caper : hay !
How is that ?
You know I call Madam Philautia , my Honour ;
and she calls me her Ambition .
Now , ( when I meet her
in the Presence anon ) I will come to her , and say ,
sweet Honour , I have hitherto contented my Sense with the
lillies of your hand , but now I will taste the roses of your lip ;
and ( withal ) kiss her : to which she cannot but blush -
ing answer , nay , now you are too ambitious .
And then
do I reply ; I cannot be too ambitious of Honour , sweet
Wil't not be good ?
ha ?
ha ?
O , assure your Soul .
By Heaven , I think 'twill be excellent , and a
very politick atcheivement of a kiss .
I have thought upon one for Moria , of a sudden
too , if it take .
What is't my dear Invention ?
Marry , I will come to her , ( and she always
wears a Muff , if you be remembred ) and I will tell her ,
Madam , your whole self cannot but be perfectly wise : for
your hands have wit enough to keep themselves warm .
Now ( before Jove ) admirable ! look , thy Page
takes it too ; by Ph?bus ,
my sweet facetious Rascal , I
could eat Water-gruel with thee a Month , for this jest ,
my dear Rogue .
O , ( by Hercules ) 'tis your only Dish , above all
your Potato 's or Oyster-pyes in the World .
I have ruminated upon a most rare wish too , and
the Prophesie to it , but I 'll have some friend to be the
Prophet ; as thus : I do wish my self one of my Mistresse 's
Another demands , Why would he be one of his
Mistresse 's cioppini ?
A third answers , Because he would
make her higher .
A fourth shall say , That will make her
And a fifth shall conclude : Then do I prophocie
pride will have a fall , and he shall give it her .
I 'll be your Prophet .
By Gods so , it will be
most exquisite ; thou art a fine inventious Rogue , Sirrah .
Nay , an' I have poesies for Rings too , and riddles
that they dream not of .
Tut , they 'll do that , when they come to sleep
on 'em , time enough : but were thy devices never in the
Presence yet , Hedon ?
O , no , I disdain that .
' Twere good we went afore then , and brought
them acquainted with the room where they shall act ,
lest the strangeness of it put them out of countenance ,
when they should come forth .
Is that a Courtier too ?
Troth no ; he has two essential parts of the
Courtier , Pride , and Ignorance ; marry , the rest come
somewhat after the ordinary Gallant .
' Tis Impudence it
self , Anaides ; one that speaks all that comes in his
Cheeks , and will blush no more than a sackbut .
He
lightly occupies the Jesters room at the Table , and keeps
Laughter , Gelaia ( a Wench in Pages attire ) following
him in place of a Squire , whom he now and then
tickles with some strange ridiculous stuff , utter 'd ( as his
Land came to him ) by chance .
He will censure or
discourse of any thing , but as absurdly as you would
His fashion is not to take knowledg of him that is
beneath him in Cloaths .
He never drinks below the
He do 's naturally admire his Wit that wears
Gold-lace , or Tissue .
Stabs any Man that speaks more
contemptibly of the Schollar than he .
He is a great
proficient in all the illiberal Sciences , as cheating , drink -
ing , swaggering , whoring , and such like : never kneels
but to pledg Healths , nor prays but for a Pipe of Pud-
He will blaspheme in his Shirt .
The
Oaths which he vomits at one Supper , would maintain
a Town of Garrison in good swearing a Twelve-month .
One other genuine quality he has , which Crowns all
these , and that is this : to a Friend in want , he will not
depart with the weight of a sodred Groat , lest the World
might censure him Prodigal , or report him a Gull :
marry , to his Cockatrice , or Punquetto , half a dozen
Taffata Gowns , or Sattin Kirtles , in a pair or two of
Months , why they are nothing .
I commend him , he is one of my Clients .
sence , and see , the privacy of this Room , how
sweetly it offers it self to our retir 'd intendments .
Page ,
cast a vigilant , and enquiring Eye about , that we be
not rudely surpriz 'd , by the approach of some ruder
I warrant you , Sir . I 'll tell you when the Wolf
enters , fear nothing .
O , what a mass of benefit shall we possess , in be-
ing the invisible Spectators of this strange Show now to
be acted .
Plant your self there , Sir : and observe me .
You
shall now , as well be the Ocular , as the Ear-witness ,
how clearly I can refel that paradox , or rather pseudodox ;
of those , which hold the Face to be the Index of the
mind , which ( I assure you ) is not so , in any politick
Creature : for instance ; I will now give you the parti-
cular , and distinct face of every your most noted species
of Persons , as your Merchant , your Schollar , your
Soldier , your Lawyer , Courtier , &c .
and each of these
so truly , as you would swear , but that your Eye shall
see the variation of the Lineament , it were my most
proper and genuine aspect .
First , for your Merchant ,
or City-face , 'tis thus , a dull , plodding Face , still look -
ing in a direct line , forward : there is no great matter
in this Face .
Then have you your Students , or aca -
demique Face , which is here , an honest , simple , and
methodical Face : but somewhat more spred than the
The third is your Soldiers Face , a menacing ,
and astounding Face , that looks broad , and big : the
grace of this Face consisteth much in a Beard .
The anti-
face , to this , is your Lawyers Face , a contracted , sub -
tile , and intricate Face , full of quirks , and turnings ,
a labyrinth?an Face , now angularly , now circularly , e-
very way aspected .
Next is your statist 's Face , a seri-
ous , solemn , and supercilious Face , full of formal , and
square Gravity , the Eye ( for the most part ) deeply and
artificially shadow 'd : there is great judgment required
in the making of this Face .
But now , to come to your
Face of Faces , or Courtiers Face , 'tis of three sorts ,
according to our subdivision of a Courtier , Elementary ,
Practick , and Theorick .
Your Courtier Theorick , is
he , that hath arriv 'd to his farthest , and doth now
know the Court , rather by speculation , than practice ;
and this is his Face : a fastidious and oblick Face , that
looks , as it went with a Vice , and were screw 'd thus .
Your Courtier Practick , is he , that is yet in his Path ,
his course , his way , and hath not toucht the puntilio ,
or point of his hope ; his Face is here : a most promi-
sing , open , smooth , and over-flowing Face , that seems
as it would run , and pour it self into you .
Somewhat
a northerly Face .
Your Courtier Elementary , is one
but newly enter 'd , or as it were in the alphabet , or ut-re -
mi-fa-sol-la of Courtship .
Note well this Face , for it is
this you must practice .
I 'll practice 'em all , if you please , Sir .
I , hereafter you may : and it will not be alto-
gether an ungrateful study .
For , let your Soul be as-
sur 'd of this ( in any rank , or profession whatever ) the
more general , or major part of Opinion goes with the
Face , and ( simply ) respects nothing else .
Therefore ,
if that can be made exactly , curiously , exquisitely ,
thorowly , it is enough : But ( for the present ) you shall
only apply your self to this Face of the Elementary
Courtier , a light , revelling , and protesting Face , now
blushing , now smiling , which you may help much with
a wanton wagging of your Head , thus , ( a Feather will
teach you ) or with kissing your Finger that hath the
Ruby , or playing with some String of your Band , which
is a most quaint kind of melancholy besides : or ( if a -
mong Ladies ) laughing lowd , and crying up your own
Wit , though perhaps borrow 'd , it is not amiss .
Where
is your Page ?
call for your Casting-bottle , and place
your mirrour in your Hat , as I told you : so .
Come ,
look not pale , observe me , set your face , and enter .
O , for some excellent Painter , to have tane the
Copy of all these Faces !
Fie , I premonish you of that : In the Court ,
Boy , Lacquey , or Sirrah .
Master , Lupus in ? ? ?
O , 'tis Prosaites .
Sirrah prepare my Casting-bottle , I think I must
be enforc 'd to purchase me another Page , you see how
at hand Cos waits here .
So will he too , in time .
What 's he , Mercury ?
A notable Smelt .
One , that hath newly enter-
tain 'd the Begger to follow him , but cannot get him to
wait near enough .
' Tis Asotus , the Heir of Philargyrus ;
but first I 'll give ye the others Character , which may
make his the clearer .
He that is with him is Amorphus
a Traveller , one so made out of the mixture and shreds
of forms , that himself is truly deform 'd .
He walks
most commonly with a Clove or Pick-tooth in his
Mouth , he is the very mint of Complement , all his Be-
haviours are printed , his Face is another Volume of
Essayes ; and his Beard an Aristrachus .
He speaks all
Cream skim 'd , and more affected than a dozen of wait-
ing Women .
He is his own Promoter in every place .
The Wife of the Ordinary gives him his Diet to main-
tain her Table in discourse , which ( indeed ) is a meer
Tyranny over the other Guests , for he will usurp all
the talk : Ten Constables are not so tedious .
He is no
great shifter , once a year his Apparel is ready to revolt .
He doth use much to arbitrate Quarrels , and fights him -
self , exceeding well ( out at a Window . )
He will lye
cheaper than any Begger , and lowder than most Clocks ;
for which he is right properly accommodated to the
Whetstone his Page .
The other Gallant is his Zani , and
doth most of these Tricks after him ; sweats to imitate
him in every thing ( to a Hair ) except a Beard , which is
not yet extant .
He doth learn to make strange Sauces ,
to eat Anchovies , Maccaroni , Bovoli , Fagioli , and Ca -
viare , because he loves 'em ; speaks as he speaks , looks ,
walks , goes so in Cloaths and Fashion : is in all as if he
were moulded of him .
Marry ( before they met ) he
had other very pretty sufficiencies , which yet he re -
tains some light impression of ; as frequenting a dan-
cing School , and grievously torturing strangers with In-
quisition after his grace in his Galliard .
He buys a
a fresh acquaintance at any rate .
His Eyes and his
Raiment confer much together as he goes in the Street .
He treads nicely like the Fellow that walks upon Ropes ;
especially the first Sunday of his Silk-stockings ; and
when he is most neat and new , you shall strip him
with Commendations .
Here comes another .
I , but one of another strain , Cupid : This Fel-
low weighs somewhat .
His name , Hermes ?
A Creature of a most perfect and divine
Temper : One , in whom the Humours and Elements
are peaceably met , without emulation of Prcedency ;
he is neither too phantastickly Melancholy , too slowly
Phlegmatick , too lightly Sanguine , or too rashly Cho-
lerick , but in all , so compos 'd and order 'd , as it is clear ,
Nature went about some full work , she did more than
make a Man when she made him .
His Discourse is like
his Behaviour , uncommon , but not unpleasing ; he is
prodigal of neither .
He strives rather to be that which
Men call Judicious , than to be thought so ; and is so
truly Learned , that he affects not to shew it .
He will
think , and speak his thought both freely ; but as distant
from depraving another Mans Merit , as proclaiming his
For his Valour , 'tis such , that he dares as little
to offer an Injury as receive one .
In sum , he hath a most
ingenuous and sweet Spirit , a sharp and season 'd Wit ,
a straight Judgment , and a strong Mind .
Fortune could
never break him , nor make him less .
He counts it his
Pleasure to despise Pleasures , and is more delighted with
good Deeds than Goods .
It is a competency to him that
he can be Vertuous .
He doth neither covet nor fear ;
he hath too much reason to do either ; and that com-
mends all things to him .
Not better than Mercury commends him .
O , Cupid , 'tis beyond my Deity to give him his
due Praises : I could leave my place in Heaven to live
among Mortals , so I were sure to be no other than he .
' Slight , I believe he is your Minion , you seem to
be so ravisht with him .
He 's one I would not have a wry thought darted
against , willingly .
No, but a straight shaft in his Bosom , I 'll pro-
mise him , if I am Citherea 's Son .
Shall we go , Cupid ?
Stay , and see the Ladies now : they 'll come pre -
I 'll help to paint them .
What ! lay Colour upon Colour ?
that affords
but an ill blazon .
Here comes Mettal to help it , the Lady Ar-
Money , Money .
The same .
A Nymph of a most wandring and
giddy Disposition , humourous as the Air , she 'll run from
Gallant to Gallant ( as they sit at primero in the Pre -
sence ) most strangely , and seldom stays with any .
She
spreads as she goes .
To day you shall have her look
as clear and fresh as the Morning , and to morrow as
melancholick as Mid-night .
She takes special pleasure
in a close obscure Lodging , and , for that cause , visits
the City so often , where she has many secret true con-
cealing Favourites .
When she comes abroad , she 's more
loose and scattering than Dust , and will fly from place
to place , as she were rapt with a Whirl-wind .
Your
young Student ( for the most part ) she affects not , only
salutes him , and away : a Poet , nor a Philosopher , she is
hardly brought to take any notice of , no , though he be
some part of an Alchemist .
She loves a Player well , and
a Lawyer infinitely : but your Fool above all .
She can
do much in Court for the obtaining of any Sute what -
soever , no Door but flies open to her , her Presence is
above a Charm .
The worst in her is want of keeping
State , and too much descending into inferior and base
Offices , she 's for any course Employment you will put
upon her , as to be your Procurer , or Pandar .
Peace , Cupid , here comes more work for you ,
another Character or two .
Now ( in very good serious ) Ladies , I will have
this Order reverst , the presence must be better main-
tain 'd from you : a Quarter past Eleven , and ne 're a
Nymph in prospective ?
beshrew my hand , there must be
a reform 'd discipline .
Is that your new Ruff , sweet
Lady-bird ?
By my truth , 'tis most intricately rare .
Good Jove , what Reverend Gentlewoman in
years might this be .
' Tis , Madam Moria , Guardian of the Nymphs .
One that is not now to be perswaded of her Wit , she
will think her self wise against all the Judgments
that come .
A Lady made all of Voice and Air , talks
any thing of any thing .
She is like one of your igno -
rant Poetasters of the time , who when they have got
acquainted with a strange word , never rest till they have
wrong it in , though it loosen the whole Fabrick of their
That was pretty and sharply noted , Cupid .
She will tell you , Philosophy was a fine Reveller ,
when she was young , and a Gallant , and that then
( though she say it ) she was thought to be the Dame -
Dido , and Helen of the Court : As also , what a sweet
Dog she had this time four years , and how it was call 'd
Fortune , and that ( if the Fates had not cut his thred ) he
had been a Dog to have given entertainment to any Gal-
lant
lant in this Kingdom : and unless she had whelpt it her
self , she could not have lov 'd a thing better i' this
O , I prithee no more , I am full of her .
Yes ( I must needs tell you ) she composes a Sack -
posset well ; and would court a young Page sweetly ,
but that her breath is against it .
Now , her Breath ( or something more strong )
protect me from her : th'other , th'other , Cupid .
O , that 's my Lady and Mistress , Madam Phi-
She admires not her self for any one particula -
rity , but for all : she is fair , and she knows it : she has a
pretty light wit too , and she knows it : she can dance ,
and she knows that too : play at Shittle-cock , and
that too : no quality she had , but she shall take a very
particular knowledg of , and most Lady-like commend
it to you .
You shall have her at any time read you the
History of her self , and very subtilly run over another
Ladies sufficiencies , to come to her own .
She has a
good superficial Judgment in Painting ; and would seem
to have so in Poetry .
A most compleat Lady in the Opi-
nion of some three beside her self .
Faith , how lik 'd you my quippe to Hedon , about
the Garter ?
was't not witty ?
Exceeding witty and integrate : you did so ag-
gravate the Jest withal .
And did I not dance movingly the last night ?
Movingly ?
out of measure ( in troth ) sweet
A happy commendation , to dance out of mea -
Save you wanted the swim i' the turn : O !
when I was at Fourteen ? ?
Nay , that 's mine own from any Nymph in the
Court ( I am sure on't ) therefore you mistake me in
that , Guardian : both the swim and the trip , are proper-
ly mine , every body will affirm it , that has any judg-
ment in dancing : I assure you .
Come now , Philautia , I am for you , shall we go ?
I , good Phantaste : What ! have you chang 'd your
Head-tire ?
Yes faith , th'other was so near the Common :
it had no extraordinary grace ; besides , I had worn it
almost a day , in good troth .
I 'll be sworn , this is most excellent for the device ,
and rare .
' Tis after the Italian print , we look 'd on
t 'other night .
' Tis so : By this Fan , I cannot abide any thing
that favours the poor over-worn cut , that has any kin-
dred with it ; I must have variety , I : this mixing in
fashion , I hate it worse than to burn Juniper in my
Chamber , I protest .
And yet we cannot have a new peculiar Court-
tire , but these Retainers will have it ; these Suburb-sunday-
waiters ; these Courtiers for high days ; I know not what
I should call 'em ? ?
O , I , they do most pitifully imitate , but I have
a Tire a coming (y ' faith ) shall ? ?
In good certain , Madam , it makes you look
most Heavenly ; but ( lay your hand on your Heart )
you never skin 'd a new Beauty more prosperously in
you life , nor more metaphysically : look , good Lady ,
sweet Lady , look .
' Tis very clear , and well , believe me .
But if you
had seen mine yesterday , when 'twas young , you would
have ? ?
who 's your Doctor , Phantaste ?
Nay , that 's counsel , Philautia , you shall pardon
me : yet ( I 'll assure you ) he 's the most dainty , sweet ,
absolute , rare Man of the whole Colledge .
O ! his very
looks , his discourse , his behaviour , all he does is Physick ,
I protest .
For Heavens sake , his name ; good , dear Phan-
taste ? ?
No, no , no , no , no , no , ( believe me ) not for
a Million of Heavens : I will not make him cheap .
Fie ? ?
There is a Nymph too , of a most curious and e-
laborate strain , light , all motion , an ubiquitary , she is
every where , Phantaste ? ?
Her very name speaks her , let her pass .
But are
these ( Cupid ) the Stars of Cynthia 's Court ?
do these
Nymphs attend upon Diana ?
They are in her Court ( Mercury ) but not as
Stars , these never come in the Presence of Cynthia .
The Nymphs that make her Train , are , the Divine Arete ,
Time , Phronesis , Thauma , and others of that high sort .
These are privately brought in by Moria in this licen-
tious time , against her knowledg : and ( like so many
Meteors ) will vanish , when she appears .
COme follow me , my wags , and say as I say .
There 's no riches but in rags ; hey day , hey day .
You that profess this Art , come away , come away ,
And help to bear a part .
Hey day ; hey day , &c .
What ! those that were our fellow Pages but now ,
so soon preferr 'd to be Yeomen of the Bottles ?
the
Mystery , the Mystery , good wags ?
Some Diet-drink they have the guard of ?
No, Sir , we are going in quest of a strange Foun-
tain , lately found out .
By whom ?
My Master , or the great discoverer , Amorphus .
Thou hast well intitled him , Cos, for he will
discover all he knows .
I , and a little more too , when the Spirit is upon
O , the good travelling Gentleman yonder has
caus 'd such a drought i' the Presence , with reporting
the wonders of this new Water ; that all the Ladies ,
and Gallants , lye languishing upon the Rushes , like so
many pounded Cattle i' the midst of Harvest ,
sighing one to another , and gasping , as if each of them
expected a Cock from the Fountain , to be brought into
his Mouth : and ( without we return quickly ) they are
all ( as a youth would say ) no better than a few Trowts
cast a-shore , or a Dish of Eeles in a Sand-bag .
Well then , you were best dispatch , and have a
care of them .
Come Cupid , thou and I 'll go pe-
ruse this dry wonder .
whit : you must not sink under the first disaster .
It
is with your young Grammatical Courtier , as with your
Neophyte Player , a thing usual to be daunted at the first
Presence , or Enter-view : you saw , there was Hedon ,
and Anaides , ( far more practis 'd Gallants than your self )
who were both out , to comfort you .
It is no disgrace ,
no more , than for your adventrous Reveller , to fall by
some inauspicious chance in his Galliard , or for some
subtil politick , to undertake the Bastinado , that the State
might think worthily of him , and respect him as a Man
well beaten to the World .
What ! hath your Taylor
provided the Property ( we spake of ) at your Cham -
ber , or no ?
I think he has .
Nay ( I intreat you ) be not so flat and melan-
Erect your mind : you shall redeem this with
the Courtship I will teach you against Afternoon .
Where
eat you to day ?
Where you please , Sir , any where , I.
Come , let us go and taste some light Dinner , a
Dish of slic 'd caviare , or so , and after , you shall practise
an hour at your Lodging some few Forms that I have
If you had but so far gathered your Spirits
to you , as to have taken up a Rush ( when you were out )
and wagg 'd it thus , or clens 'd your Teeth with it : or but
turn 'd aside , and fain 'd some business to whisper with
your Page , till you had recover 'd your self , or but found
some slight stain in your Stocking , or any other pretty
Invention ( so it had been sudden , ) you might have come
off with a most clear and courtly grace .
A poyson of all , I think I was forespoke , I.
No, I must tell you , you are not audacious
enough , you must frequent Ordinaries , a Month more ,
to initiate you self : In which time , it will not be amiss ,
if ( in private ) you keep good your acquaintance with
Crites , or some other of his poor Coat ; visit his Lodg-
ing secretly and often ; become an earnest suter to hear
some of his Labours .
O Jove ! Sir , I could never get him to read a
Line to me .
You must then wisely mix your self in Rank
with such as you know can : and , as your Ears do meet
with a new Phrase , or an acute Jest , take it in : a quick
nimble Memory will lift it away , and , at your next
publick Meal it is your own .
But I shall never utter it perfectly , Sir .
No matter , let it come lame .
In ordinary talk
you shall play it away , as you do your light Crowns at
primero : It will pass .
I shall attempt , Sir .
It is your shifting age for wit , and I assure
you , Men must be Prudent .
After this , you may to
court , and there fall in , first with the Waiting-woman ,
then with the Lady .
Put case they do retain you
there , as a fit Property , to hire Coaches some pair of
Months , or so ; or to read them asleep in Afternoons up -
on some pretty Pamphlet to breath you ; why , it shall
in time imbolden you to some farther Atchievment : In
the interim , you may fashion your self to be careless
and impudent .
How if they would have me to make Verses ?
Iheard Hedon spoke to for some .
Why , you must prove the aptitude of your Ge-
nius ; if you find none , you must harken out a Vein ,
and buy ; provided you pay for the silence as for the
work ; then you may securely call it your own .
Yes , and I 'll give out my Acquaintance with all
the best Writers , to countenance me the more .
Rather seem not to know 'em , it is your best .
Be wise , that you never so much as mention the
name of one , nor remember it mention 'd ; but if they
be offer 'd to you in discourse , shake you light Head ,
make between a sad and a smiling Face , pitty some , rail
at all , and commend your self : 'tis your only safe , and
unsuspected course .
Come , you shall look back upon
the Court again to day , and be restor 'd to your Colours :
I do now partly aim at the cause of your repulse ? ?
( which was ominous indeed ) for as you enter at the
Door , there is oppos 'd to you the frame of a Woolf in
the Hangings , which ( surprizing your eye suddenly ) gave
a false alarm to the Heart ; and that was it call 'd your
Blood out of your Face , and so rowted the whole rank
of your Spirits : I beseech you labour to forget it .
And
remember ( as I inculcated to you before , for your com-
fort ) Hedon , and Anaides .
unluckily perverted , and spoyl 'd by a Whore-son ,
Book-worm , a Candle-waster ?
Nay , be not impatient , Hedon .
' Slight , I would fain know his name .
Hang him , poor grogran-rascal , prithee think
not of him : I 'll send for him to my Lodging , and have
him blanketted when thou wilt , Man .
By Gods so ; I would thou could 'st .
Look , here
he comes .
Laugh at him , laugh at him , ha , ha , ha .
Fough , he smells all Lamp-oyl with studying by
How confidently he went by us , and carelesly !
never mov 'd ! nor stirr 'd at any thing ! did you observe
him ?
I , a pox on him , let him go , Dormouse ; he is
in a dream now .
He has no other time to sleep , but
thus when he walks abroad to take the Air .
Gods precious , this afflicts me more than all the
rest , that we should so particularly direct our hate and
contempt against him , and he to carry it thus without
wound or passion ! 'tis insufferable .
' Slid , ( my dear Envy ) if thou but saist the
word now , I 'll undo him eternally for thee .
How , sweet Anaides ?
Marry half a score of us get him in ( one night )
and make him pawn his Wit for a Supper .
Away , thou hast such unseasonable Jests .
By this
Heaven , I wonder at nothing more than our Gentle -
men-ushers , that will suffer a piece of Serge , or Perpetua -
na to come into the Presence : methinks they should
( out of their experience ) better distinguish the silken
Disposition of Courtiers , than to let such terrible course
Rags mix with us , able to fret any smooth or gentle So-
ciety to the Threds with their rubbing Devices .
Unless 'twere Lent , Ember-weeks , or Fasting-days ,
when the place is most penuriously empty of all other
good out-sides .
Dam me , if I should adventure on his
Company once more , without a Sute of Buff to defend
my Wit ; he does nothing but stab the slave : how mis -
chievously he cross 'd thy device of the prophesie there ?
And Moria , she comes without her Muff too , and there
my invention was lost .
Well , I am resolv 'd what I 'll do .
What , my good spirituous Spark ?
Marry , speak all the Venom I can of him ; and
poyson his Reputation in every place where I come .
' Fore God , most courtly .
And if I chance to be present where any que -
stion is made of his sufficiencies , or of any thing he hath
done private or publick , I 'll censure it slightly and ridi-
At any hand beware of that , so thou maist draw
thine own Judgment in suspect .
No, I 'll instruct thee
what thou shalt do , and by a safer means : Approve any
thing thou hearest of his , to the receiv 'd Opinion of it ;
but if it be extraordinary , give it from him to some o -
ther whom thou more particularly affect 'st ; that 's the
way to plague him , and he shall never come to defend
' Slud , I 'll give out all he does is dictated from
other Men , and swear it too ( if thou'lt ha' me ) and
that I know the time and place where he stole it , though
my Soul be guilty of no such thing ; and that I think ,
out of my Heart , he hates such barren shifts : yet to do
thee a pleasure , and him a disgrace , I 'll dam my self ,
or do any thing .
Gramercy , my dear Devil : we 'll put it seriously
in practice , y ' faith .
Shall shake thy spight off with a careless smile .
Poor pittious Gallants ! What lean idle sleights
Their thoughts suggest to flatter their starv 'd hopes ?
As if I knew not how to entertain
These Straw-devices : but , of force , must yield
To the weak stroke of their calumnious Tongues .
What should I care what every dor doth buz
In credulous Ears ?
it is a Crown to me ,
That the best judgments can report me wrong 'd ;
Them lyars ; and their slanders impudent .
Perhaps (upon the rumour of their Speeches )
Some grieved Friend will whisper to me ; Crites ,
Men speak ill of thee .
So they be ill Men ;
If they spake worse , 'twere better : for of such
To be disprais 'd , is the most perfect praise .
What can his censure hurt me , whom the World
Hath censur 'd vile before me ?
If good Chrestus ,
Euthus , or Phronimus , had spoke the words ,
They could have mov 'd me , and I should have call 'd
I think but what they are , and am not stirr 'd .
The one , a light voluptuous Reveller ,
The other a strange arrogating Puff ,
Both impudent , and ignorant enough ;
That talk ( as they are wont ) not as I merit :
Traduce by custom , as most Dogs do bark ,
Do nothing out of judgment , but disease ,
Speak ill , because they never could speak well .
And who 'ld be angry with this Race of Creatures ?
What wise Physician have we ever seen
Mov 'd with a frantick Man ?
the same affects
That he doth bear to his sick Patient ,
Should a right mind carry to such as these :
And I do count it a most rare revenge ,
That I can thus ( with such a sweet neglect )
Pluck from them all the pleasure of their malice .
For that 's the Mark of all their inginous drifts ,
To wound my patience , howsoe 're they seem
To aim at other objects : which if miss 'd
Their envy 's like an Arrow , shot upright ,
That , in the fall , indangers their own Heads .
You have not visited your jealous Friends ?
Where I have seen ( most honour 'd Arete , )
The strangest pageant , fashion 'd like a Court ,
( At least I dream't I saw it ) so diffus 'd ,
So painted , pyed , and full of Rainbow strains ,
As never yet (either by time , or place )
Was made the Food to my distasted sense :
Nor can my weak imperfect Memory
Now render half the forms unto my Tongue ,
That were convolv 'd within this thrifty room .
Here , stalks me by a proud and spangled Sir ,
That looks three hand-fulls higher than his Foretop ;
Savours himself alone , is only kind
And loving to himself : one that will speak
More dark , and doubtful than six Oracles ;
Salutes a Friend , as if he had a stich ,
Is his own Chronicle , and scarce can eat
For registring himself : is waited on
By Mimicks , Jesters , Pandars , Parasites ,
And other such like Prodigies of Men .
He past , appears some mincing Marmoset
Made all of Clothes , and Face ; his Limbs so set
As if they had some voluntary act
Without Mans motion , and must move just so
In spite of their Creation : one that weighs
His Breath between his Teeth , and dares not smile
Beyond a point , for fear t 'unstarch his look ;
Hath travel 'd to make Legs , and seen the Cringe
Of several Courts , and Courtiers ; knows the time
Of giving Titles , and of taking Walls ;
Hath read Court-common-places ; made them his :
Studied the Grammar of state , and all the Rules
Each formal Usher in that politick School
Can teach a Man .
A third comes giving nods
To his repenting Creditors , protests
To weeping Sutors , takes the coming Gold
Of insolent , and base Ambition ,
That hourly rubs his dry and itchy Palms :
Which grip't , like burning Coals , he hurls away
Into the Laps of Bawds , and Buffoons Mouths .
With him there meets some subtile Proteus , one
Can change , and vary with all forms he sees ;
Be any thing but honest ; serves the time ;
Hovers betwixt two Factions , and explores
The drifts of both ; which ( with cross Face ) he bereas
To the divided Heads , and is receiv 'd
With mutual grace of either : one that dares
Do deeds worthy the Hurdle , or the Wheel ,
To be thought some body ; and is ( in sooth )
Such as the Satyrist points truly forth ,
That only to his Crimes owes all his worth .
You tell us wonders , Crites .
This is nothing .
There stands a Neophyte glazing of his Face ,
Pruning his Clothes , perfuming of his Hair ,
Against his Idol enters ; and repeats
( Like an unperfect Prologue , at third Musick )
His part of Speeches , and confederate Jests ,
In passion to himself .
Another swears
Then walks as melancholick , and stands wreath 'd ,
As he were pinn 'd up to the Arras , thus .
A third is most in action , swims , and frisks ,
Plays with his Mistresses Paps , salutes here Pumps ,
Adores her Hems , her Skirts , her Knots , her Curls ,
Will spend his Patrimony for a Garter ,
Or the least Feather in her bounteous Fan .
A fourth , he only comes in for a mute :
Another , of his Lip ; a third , of his Nose ;
A fourth commend his Leg ; a fifth his Foot ;
A sixt his hand ; and every one a Limb :
That you would think the poor distorted Gallant
Must there expire .
Then fall they in discourse
Of Tires and Fashions , how they must take place ,
Where they may kiss , and whom , when to sit down ,
And with what grace to rise ; if they salute ,
What curtesie they must use : such Cob-web stuff ,
As would enforce the common 'st sense abhor
Th' Arachnean workers .
Patience , gentle Crites .
This knot of Spiders will be soon dissolv 'd ,
And all their Webs swept out of Cynthia 's Court ,
When once her glorious Deity appears ,
And but presents it self in her full light :
Till when , go in , and spend your hours with us
Your honour 'd Friends , Time and Phronesis ,
In Contemplation of our Goddess Name .
Think
Think on some sweet and choice invention , now ,
Worthy her serous and illustrious Eyes ,
That from the merit of it we may take
Desir 'd occasion to prefer your worth ,
And make your service known to Cynthia .
It is the pride of Arete to grace
Her studious lovers ; and ( in scorn of Time ,
Envy , and Ignorance ) to lift their state
Above a vulgar height .
True happiness
Consists not in the multitude of friends ,
But in the worth , and choice .
Nor would I have
Vertue a popular regard pursue :
Let them be good that love me , though but few .
I kiss thy hands , divinest Arete ,
And vow my self to thee , and Cynthia .
cloke your self , and come forth .
Taylor , bestow
thy absence upon us ; and be not prodigal of this secret ,
but to a dear Customer .
' Tis well enter 'd , Sir , Stay ,
you come on too fast ; your pace is too impetuous .
Ima -
gine this to be the palace of your pleasure , or place
where your Lady is pleas 'd to be seen .
First , you pre -
sent your self , thus : and spying her , you fall off , and
walk some two turns ; in which time , it is to be suppos 'd ,
your passion hath sufficiently whited your Face : then
( stifling a sigh or two , and closing your Lips ) with a
trembling boldness , and bold terrour , you advance your
self forward .
Prove thus much , I pray you .
Yes , Sir , ( pray Jove I can light on it . )
Here , I
come in , you say , and present my self ?
And then I spy her , and walk off ?
Very good .
Now , Sir , I stifle , and advance forward ?
Yes , Sir , trembling : I shall do it better when I
come to it .
And what must I speak now ?
Marry , you shall say : Dear beauty , or , sweet
honour ( or by what other Title you please to remember
her ) methinks you are melancholy .
This is , if she be
alone now , and discompanied .
Well , Sir , I 'll enter again ; her Title shall be ,
My dear Lindabrides .
Lindabrides ?
I , Sir , the Emperor Alicandroes Daughter , and
the Prince Meridians Sister ( in the Knight of the Sun )
she should have been married to him , but that the Prin-
cess Claridiana ? ? ?
O , you betray your reading .
Nay , Sir , I have read History , I am a little
Interrupt me not , good Sir . My dear Lin-
dabrides , My dear Lindabrides , My dear Lindabrides , me-
thinks you are melancholy .
Or thus , Sir . All variety of divine Pleasures ,
choice Sports , sweet Musick , rich Fare , brave Attire ,
soft Beds , and silken Thoughts , attend this dear Beauty .
Believe me , that 's pretty .
All variety of divine
Pleasures , choice Sports , sweet Musick , rich Fare ,
brave Attires , soft Beds , and silken Thoughts , attend
this dear Beauty .
And then , offering to kiss her Hand , if she shall
coyly recoil , and signifie your Repulse ; you are to re -
enforce your self , with , More than most fair Lady , let
not the rigour of your just disdain thus coursly censure
of your Servants zeal ; and withal , protest to her to be
the only and absolute unparalell 'd Creature you do
adore , and admire , and respect , and reverence , in this
Court , corner of the World , or Kingdom .
This is hard , by my faith .
I 'll begin it all again .
Do so , and I will act it for your Lady .
Will you vouchsafe , Sir ?
All variety of divine
Pleasures , choice Sports , sweet Musick , rich Fare , brave
Attire , soft Beds , and silken Thoughts attend this dear
So , Sir , pray you away .
More than most fair Lady , let not the Rigour of
your just disdain , thus coursly censure of your Servants
zeal , I protest , you are the only , and absolute , unap -
parelled ? ? ?
Unparalell 'd Creature , I do adore , and admire ,
and respect , and reverence , in this Court , corner of the
World , or Kingdom .
This is , if she abide you .
But now , put the
Case she should be passant when you enter , as thus : you
are to frame your Gate thereafter , and call upon her ,
Lady , Nymph , sweet refuge , Star of our Court .
Then
if she be guardant , hear : you are to come on , and ( la -
terally disposing your self ) swear , by her blushing and
well coloured Cheek , the bright dye of her Hair , her
Ivory Teeth ( though they be Ebony ) or some such
white and innocent Oath , to induce you .
If reguar-
dant , then maintain your Station , brisk , and irpe , shew
the supple motion of your pliant Body , but ( in chief )
of your Knee , and Hand , which cannot but arride her
proud Humour exceedingly .
I conceive you , Sir , I shall perform all these
things in good time , I doubt not , they do so hit me .
Well , Sir , I am your Lady ; make use of any
of these beginnings , or some other out of your own in-
vention ; and prove , how you can hold up , and follow
Say , say .
Yes , Sir , my dear Lindabrides .
? ? ?
No, you affect that Lindabrides too much .
And
( let me tell you ) it is not so courtly .
Your Pedant
should provide you some Parcels of French , or some
pretty Commodity of Italian to commence with , if you
would be exotick and exquisite .
Yes , Sir , he was at my Lodging t 'other Morn -
ing , I gave him a Doublet .
Double your Benevolence , and give him the
Hose too , clothe you his Body , he will help to apparel
your Mind .
But now , see what your proper Genius can
perform alone , without adjection of any other Minerva .
I comprehend you , Sir .
I do stand you , Sir : fall back to your first place .
Good , passing well : Very properly pursu 'd .
Beautiful , ambiguous , and sufficient Lady , what !
are you all alone ?
We would be , Sir , if you would leave us .
I am at your Beauties appointment , bright An-
gel ; but ? ? ?
What but ?
No harm , more than most fair Feature .
That touch relished well .
But , I protest ? ? ?
And why should you protest ?
For good will ( dear esteem 'd Madam ) and I
hope , your Ladyship will so conceive of it :
And will , in time , return from your disdain ,
And rue the suffrance of our friendly pain .
O , that Piece was excellent ! if you could pick
out more of these Play-particles , and ( as occasion shall
salute you ) embroider , or damask your discourse with
them , perswade your Soul , it would most judiciously
commend you .
Come , this was a well discharg 'd , and
auspicious bout .
Prove the second .
Lady , I cannot ruffle it in red and yellow .
Why , if you can revel it in white , Sir , 'tis suf -
L 2 Aso .
Say you so , sweet Lady ?
Lan , tede , de , de , de ,
dant , dant , dant , dante , &c .
No ( in good faith ) Ma -
dam , whosoever told your Ladyship so , abus 'd you ;
but I would be glad to meet your Ladyship in a measure .
Me , Sir ?
belike you measure me by your self ,
then ?
Would I might , fair Feature .
And what were you the better , if you might ?
The better to please you to ask , fair Lady .
Why , this was ravishing , and most acutely con-
Well , spend not your humour too much , you
have now competently exercised your conceit : This
(once or twice a day ) will render you an accomplisht
elaborate , and well levelled Gallant .
Convey in your
Courting-stock , we will ( in the heat of this ) go visit
the Nymphs Chamber .
Friend so commended to us .
So would I , for he has left all us in travel with
expectation of it .
Pray Jove , I never rise from this Couch , if ever
I thirsted more for a thing , in my whole time of being
a Courtier .
Nor I , I 'll be sworn : The very mention of it
sets my Lips in a worse heat , than if he had sprinkled
them with Mercury .
Reach me the Glass , Sirrah .
Here , Lady .
They do not peel , sweet Charge , do they ?
Yes , a little , Guardian .
O , 'tis an eminent good sign .
Ever when my
Lips do so , I am sure to have some delicious good drink
or other approaching .
Marry , and this may be good for us Ladies : for
( it seems ) 'tis far fet by their stay .
My Palate for yours ( dear Honor ) it shall prove
most Elegant , I warrant you : O , I do fancy this gear
that 's long a coming , with an unmeasurable strain .
Pray thee sit down , Philautia , that Rebatu be-
comes thee singularly .
Is't not quaint ?
Yes faith .
Methinks , thy Servant Hedon is no-
thing so obsequious to thee , as he was wont to be : I
know not how , he 's grown out of his Garb a late , he 's
In trueness , and so methinks too ; he 's much
Tut , let him be what he will , 'tis an animal I
dream not of .
This tire ( methinks ) makes me look
very ingeniously , quick , and spirited , I should be some
Laura , or some Delia , methinks .
As I am wise ( fair Honors ) that Title she gave
him , to be her Ambition , spoil 'd him : Before , he was
the most propitious and observant young Novice ?
No, no , you are the whole Heaven awry , Guar-
dian : 'tis the swaggering Coach-horse Anaides , draws
with him there , has been the diverter of him .
For Cupid 's sake , speak no more of him ; would
I might never dare to look in a Mirror again , if I respect
e 're a Marmaset of 'em all , otherwise than I would a
Feather , or my Shittle-cock , to make sport with now
and then .
Come , sit down ; troth ( an' you be good Beau -
ties ) let 's run over 'em all now : Which is the proper 'st
Man amongst them ! I say , the Traveller , Amorphus .
O , fie on him , he looks like a Venetian Trumpe-
ter , i' the Battel of Lepanto , in the Gallery yonder ;
and speaks to the Tune of a Country Lady , that comes
ever i' the rereward , or train of a Fashion .
I should have judgment in a Feature , sweet
A body would think so , at these years .
And I prefer another now , far before him , a
Million at least .
Who might that be , Guardian ?
Marry ( fair Charge ) Anaides .
Anaides ! you talk't of a Tune Philautia , there 's
one speaks in a Key ; like the opening of some Justices
Gate , or a Post-boys Horn , as if his Voyce fear 'd an
arrest for some ill words it should give , and were loth to
come forth .
I , and he has a very imperfect Face .
Like a Sea-monster , that were to ravish Andro-
meda from the Rock .
His Hand 's too great too , by at least a straws
Nay , he has a worse fault than that , too .
A long Heel ?
That were a fault in a Lady , rather than him :
No, they say , he puts off the Calves of his Legs , with
his Stockings every night .
Out upon him : turn to another of the Pictures ,
for loves sake .
What says Argurion ?
whom do 's she
commend , afore the rest ?
I hope , I have instructed her sufficiently for an
Troth , I made the motion to her Ladiship for
one to day , i' the Presence , but it appear 'd she was
other ways furnisht before : She would none .
Who was that , Argurion ?
Marry , the poor plain Gentleman , i' the black ,
Who , Crites ?
I , I , he .
A fellow , that no body so much as
look't upon , or regarded , and she would have had me
done him particular grace .
That was a true trick of your self , Moria , to
perswade Argurion to affect the Schollar .
Tut , but she shall be no chuser for me .
In good
faith , I like the Citizens Son there , Asotus ; methinks ,
none of them all come near him .
Not Hedon ?
Hedon ?
in troth no .
Hedon 's a pretty slight
Courtier , and he wears his Clothes well , and sometimes
in fashion ; Marry , his Face is but indifferent , and he
has no such excellent Body .
No, th'other is a most de-
licate Youth , a sweet Face , a straight Body , a well pro-
portion 'd Leg and Foot , a white Hand , a tender Voyce .
How now , Argurion ?
O , you should have let her alone , she was be-
stowing a Copy of him upon us .
Such a Nose were e-
nough to make me love a Man , now .
And then his several Colours , he wears ; where -
in he flourisheth changeably , every day .
O , but his short Hair , and his narrow Eyes !
Why , she dotes more palpably upon him , than
e 're his Father did upon her .
Believe me , the young Gentleman deserves it .
If
she could dote more , 'twere not amiss .
He is an ex -
ceeding proper youth , and would have made a most neat
Barber-surgion , if he had been put to it in time .
Say you so ?
methinks he looks like a Taylor al-
I , that had sayed on one of his Customers Sutes .
His Face is like a squeez 'd Orange , or ? ?
Well , Ladies , jest on : the best of you both
would be glad of such a Servant .
I , I 'll be sworn would they , though he be a lit-
tle shame-fac 'd .
Shame-fac 'd , Moria ! out upon him .
Your shame -
fac 'd Servant is your only Gull .
Go to , Beauties , make much of Time , and Place ,
and Occasion , and Opportunity , and Favourites , and
things
things that belong to 'em , for I 'll ensure you , they will
all relinquish ; they cannot endure above another year ;
I know it out of future experience : and therefore take
exhibition , and warning .
I was once a Reveller my self ,
and though I speak it ( as mine own Trumpet ) I was then
esteem 'd ? ?
The very March-bane of the Court , I warrant
you ?
And all the Gallants came about you like flyes ,
did they not ?
Go to , they did somewhat , that 's no matter
Nay , good Moria , be not angry .
Put case that
we four now had the grant from Juno , to wish our
selves into what happy Estate we could ?
what would
you wish to be , Moria ?
Who I ?
Let me see now .
I would wish to be a
Wise-woman , and know all the secrets of Court , City ,
and Country .
I would know what were done behind
the Arras , what upon the Stairs , what i' the Garden ,
what i' the Nymphs Chamber , what by Barge , and by
what Coach .
I would tell you which Courtier were scab -
bed , and which not ; which Lady had her own Face to
lye with her a nights , and which not ; who put off their
Teeth with their Clothes in Court , who their Hair , who
their Complexion ; and in which Box they put it .
There
should not a Nymph , or a Widdow be got with Child i'
the Verge , but I would guess ( within one or two , ) who
was the right Father : and in what Month it was gotten ;
with what words ; and which way .
I would tell you ,
which Madam lov 'd a Monsieur , which a Player , which
a Page ; who slept with her Husband , who with her
Friend , who with her Gentleman-usher , who with her
Horse-keeper , who with her Monkey , and who with all .
Yes , and who jigg 'd the Cock too .
Fye , you 'ld tell all , Moria .
If I should wish now ,
it should be too have your Tongue out .
But what says
Philautia ?
who would she be ?
Troth , the very same I am .
Only I would wish
my self a little more Command and Soveraignty ; that
all the Court were subject to my absolute beck , and all
things in it depending on my look ; as if there were no
other Heaven , but in my smile , nor other Hell , but in
my frown ; that I might send for any Man I list , and
have his Head cut off , when I have done with him ; or
made an Eunuch , if he denyed me : and if I saw a bet-
ter Face than my own , I might have my Doctor to
poyson it .
What would you wish , Phantaste ?
Faith , I cannot ( readily ) tell you what : But
( methinks ) I should wish my self all manner of Crea -
Now , I would be an Empress ; and by and by a
Dutchess ; then a great Lady of State ; then one of
your miscellany Madams ; then a Waiting-woman ; then
your Citizens Wife ; then a course Country Gentlewo -
man ; then a Deyry-maid ; then a Shepherds Lass ; then
an Empress again , or the Queen of Fayries : And thus
I would prove the vicissitudes and whirl of Pleasures , a -
bout , and again .
As I were a Shepherdess , I would be
pip 'd and sung to ; as a Country Gentlewoman , keep
a good House , and come up to Term , to see motions ;
As a Citizens Wife , be troubled with a jealous Husband ,
and put to my shifts ; (others miseries should be my Plea -
As a Waiting-woman , I would taste my Ladies
delights to her : As a miscellany Madam invent new Tyres ,
and go visit Courtiers : As a great Lady , lye a Bed , and
have Courtiers visit me : As a Dutchess , I would keep
my State ; and as an Empress I'ld do any thing .
And ,
in all these shapes , I would ever be follow 'd with th '
affections of all that see me .
Marry , I my self would
affect none ; or if I did , it should not be heartily , but
so as I might save my self in 'em still , and take pride in
tormenting the poor wretches .
Or , ( now I think on't )
I would , for one year , wish my self one Woman , but
the richest , fairest , and dilicatest in a Kingdom , the
very center of Wealth , and Beauty , wherein all lines
of Love should meet ; and in that Person I would prove
all manner of suters , of all Humours , and of all Com -
plexions , and never have any two of a sort : I would
see how Love ( by the power of his Object ) could work
inwardly alike , in a Cholerick Man , and a Sanguine ;
in a Melancholick , and a Phlegmatick ; in a Fool , and
a Wise Man ; in a Clown and a Courtier ; in a Valiant
Man and a Coward : and how he could vary outward ,
by letting this Gallant express himself in dumb gaze ;
another with sighing , and rubbing his Fingers ; a third ,
with play-ends , and pittiful Verses ; a fourth , with stab -
bing himself , and drinking Healths , or writing languish -
ing Letters in his Blood ; a fifth , in colour 'd Ribbands ,
and good Clothes ; with this Lord to smile , and that
Lord to Court , and the t 'other Lord to dote , and one
Lord to hang himself .
And then , I to have a Book
made of all this , which I would call the Book of Hu-
mours , and every night read a little Piece , e 're I slept ,
and laugh at it .
Here comes Hedon .
SAve you , sweet and clear Beauties : By the Spirit
that moves in me , you are all most pleasingly be-
stow 'd , Ladies .
Only I can take it for no good omen ,
to find mine Honor so dejected .
You need not fear , Sir , I did of purpose humble
my self against your coming , to decline the pride of my
Fair Honor , Ambition dares not stoop ; but if it
be your sweet pleasure , I shall lose that Title I will ( as
I am Hedon ) apply my self to your Bounties .
That were the next way to dis-title my self of
O , no , rather be still Ambitious , I pray you .
I will be any thing that you please , whilst it
pleaseth you to be your self , Lady .
Sweet Phantaste ,
dear Moria , most beautiful Argurion ? ?
Farewel , Hedon .
Anaides , stay , whither go you ?
' Slight , what should I do here ?
an' you engross
'em all for your own use , 'tis time for me to seek
I engross 'em ?
Away , mischief this is one of
your extravagant Jests now , because I began to salute
'em by their Names ? ?
Faith , you might have spar 'd us Madam Pru-
dence , the Guardian there , though you had more cove-
tously aim 'd at the rest .
' Sheart , take 'em all , Man : what speak you
to me of aiming or covetous ?
I , say you so ?
nay , then , have at 'em : La -
dies , here 's one hath distinguish 'd you by your names
It shall only become me , to ask how you
do ?
Gods so , was this the design you travell 'd
with ?
Who answers the brazen Head ?
it spoke to some
Lady Wisdom , do you interpret for these
In truth , and sadness ( Honors ) you are in
great offence for this : go too : the Gentleman
( I 'll under-take with him ) is a Man of fair Li-
ving , and able to maintain a Lady in her two Carro-
ches a day , besides Pages , Munkeys and Parachitoes ,
with such Attendants as she shall think meet for
her turn , and therefore there is more respect
requirable , howsoere you seem to connive .
Hark
you , Sir , let me discourse a syllable with you .
I am to
say
say to you , these Ladies are not of that close , and open
behaviour , as haply you may suspend ; their carriage is
well known , to be such as it should be , both gentle and
O , here comes the other pair .
THat was your Fathers Love , the Nymph Argurion .
I would have you direct all your Courtship thither ;
if you could but endear your self to her affection , you
were eternally en-gallanted .
In truth , sir ?
pray Ph?bus
I prove favoursome
in her fair Eyes .
All divine mixture , and increase of Beauty to
this bright Bevy of Ladies ; and to the Male-Courti-
ers , Complement , and Courtesie .
In the behalf of the Males , I gratifie you , Amorphus .
And I of the Females .
Succinctly return 'd .
I do vail to both your
thanks , and kiss them : but primarily to yours , most in-
genious , acute , and polite Lady .
Gods my life , how he doe 's all to bequalifie her !
ingenious , acute , and polite ! as if there were not others
in place as ingenious , acute , and polite , as she .
Yes , but you must know , Lady , he cannot speak
out of a Dictionary method .
Sit down , sweet Amorphus : When will this Wa -
ter come , think you ?
It cannot now be long , fair Lady .
Now observe , Mercury .
How ! most ambiguous Beauty ?
love you ?
that
I will by this Handkercher .
' Slid he draws his Oaths out of his Pocket .
But , will you be constant ?
Constant Madam ?
I will not say for Con-
stantness , but by this Purse ( which I would be loth
to swear by , unless it were embroider 'd ) I protest ( more
than most fair Lady ) you are the only , absolute , and un-
paralell 'd Creature , I do adore , and admire , and respect ,
and reverence in this Court , corner of the World , or
Kingdom : Methinks you are Melancholy .
Do 's your Heart speak all this ?
Say you ?
O , he is groping for another Oath .
Now , by this Watch ( I marle how forward the
Day is ) I do unfeignedly vow my self ( s 'light 'tis deep -
er than I took it , past five ) yours entirely addicted
I require no more , dearest Asotus , henceforth let
me call you mine , and in remembrance of me , vouch -
safe to wear this Chain , and this Diamond .
O God , sweet Lady !
There are new Oaths for him : what ?
doth
Hermes taste no alteration in all this ?
Yes , thou hast strook Argurion inamour 'd on A-
sotus , methinks .
Alas , no : I am no body , I , I can do nothing in
this disguise .
But thou hast not wounded any of the rest , Cupid .
Not yet ; it is enough that I have begun so
Nay , these are nothing to the Gems I will hour-
ly bestow upon thee : be but faithful and kind to me , and
I will lade thee with my richest Bounties : behold , here
my Bracelets , from mine Arms .
Not so , good Lady , by this Diamond .
Take 'em , wear 'em : my Jewels , chain of Pearl ,
Pendants , all I have .
Nay then , by this Pearl you make me a wanton .
Shall not she not answer for this , to maintain
him thus in swearing ?
O , no , there is a way to wean him from this , the
Gentleman may be reclaim 'd .
I , if you had the airing of his Apparel , Couz , I
Loving ?
'twere pity I should be living else , be-
lieve me .
Save you Sir . Save you sweet Lady .
Save
you Monsieur Anaides .
Save you dear Madam .
Do 'st thou know him that saluted thee , Hedon .
No, some idle Fungoso , that hath got above the
Cup-board since yesterday ,
' Slud , I never saw him till this Morning , and
he salutes me as familiarly as if we had known together
since the Deluge , or the first year of Troy-action .
A most right-handed and auspicious Encounter .
Confine your self to your fortunes .
For sports sake , let 's have some Riddles , or Propo-
ses ; hough .
No faith , your Prophecies are best , the t 'other are
Prophecies ?
we cannot all sit in at them ; we shall
make a confusion .
No ; what call 'd you that we had
in the Forenoon ?
Substantives , and Adjectives .
Is't not Hedon .
I , that , who begins ?
I have thought ; speak your Adjectives , sirs .
But do not you change then .
Not I.
Who says ?
Yours , Signior .
What must I do , sir ?
Give forth your Adjective , with the rest ; as ,
prosperous , good , fair , sweet , well .
Any thing , that hath not been spoken .
Yes , sir , well-spoken , shall be mine .
What ?
ha' you all done ?
Then the Substantive is Breeches .
Why odori-
ferous Breeches , Guardian ?
Odoriferous , because odoriferous ; that which
contains most variety of favour , and smell , we say , is
most odoriferous : now Breeches , I presume , are inci-
dent to that variety , and therefore odoriferous Breeches .
Well , we must take it howsoever , who 's next ?
Philautia ?
Why popular Breeches ?
Marry , that is , when they are not content to be
generally noted in Court , but will press forth on com-
mon Stages , and Brokers Stalls , to the publick view of
the World .
Why humble Breeches , Argurion ?
Humble , because they use to be sate upon ; be-
sides , if you tie 'em not up , their Property is to fall
down , about your Heels .
She has worn the Breeches , it seems , which have
done so .
But why white-liver 'd ?
Why ?
are not their Linings white ?
besides when
they come in swaggering Company , and will pocket up
any thing , may they not properly be said to be white -
liver 'd ?
O , yes , we must not deny it .
And why barba -
rous , Hedon ?
Barbarous , because commonly , when you have
worn your Breeches sufficiently , you give them to your
That 's good , but how Pythagorical ?
I , Amorphus .
Why Pythagorical Breeches ?
O most kindly of all , 'tis a conceit of that fortune ,
How
I am bold to hug my Brain for .
How is't , exquisite Amorphus ?
O , I am rapt with it , 'tis so fit , so proper ,
so happy .
Nay do not rack us thus ?
I never truly relisht my self before .
Give me
your Ears .
Breeches Pythagorical , by reason of their trans -
migration into several shapes .
Most rare , in sweet troth .
Marry , this young
Gentleman , for his well-spoken ? ?
I , why well-spoken Breeches ?
Well-spoken ?
marry , well-spoken , because ? ?
whatsoever they speak is well taken ; and whatsoever is
well taken , is well spoken .
Excellent ! believe me .
Not so Ladies , neither .
But why Breeches , now ?
Breeches , quasi bear-riches ; when a Gallant
bears all his Riches in his Breeches .
Most fortunately etymologiz 'd .
Nay , we have another sport afore this , of A
thing done , and Who did it , &c .
I , good Phantaste let 's have that : Distribute the
Why , I imagine , A thing done ; Hedon thinks ,
Who did it : Moria , With what it was done ; Anaides , Where
it was done ; Argurion , When it was done ; Amorphus , For
what cause it was done ; you Philautia , What followed upon
the doing of it ; and this Gentleman , Who would have
done it better .
What ?
is't conceiv 'd about ?
Yes , yes .
Then speak you , Sir , Who would have done it better ?
How ! do 's it begin at me ?
Yes , Sir : This Play is called the Crab , it goes
May I not name my self ?
If you please , Sir , and dare abide the venture
of it .
Then , I would have done it better , what ever
it is .
No doubt on't , Sir : a good confidence .
What
For what cause , Amorphus ?
For the delight of Ladies .
When , Argurion ?
Last Progress .
Where , Anaides ?
Why , in a pair of pain 'd Slops .
With what , Moria ?
With a Glyster .
Who , Hedon ?
A Traveller ,
Then , The thing done was , An Oration was made .
An Oration was made .
By a Traveller .
With a Glyster .
In a pair of pain 'd Slops .
Last Progress .
For the delight of Ladies .
A few heat drops , and a Months mirth followed .
And , this silent Gentleman would have done it
This was not so good , now .
In good faith , these unhappy Pages would be
whipt for staying thus .
Beshrew my hand , and my heart else .
I do wonder at their Protraction !
Pray Venus my Whore have not discover 'd her
self to the rascally Boys , and that be the cause of their
I must sute my self with another Page : this idle
Prosaites will never be brought to wait well .
Sir , I have a Kinsman I could willingly wish to
your Service , if you will deign to accept of him .
And I shall be glad ( most sweet Lady ) to em -
brace him : where is he ?
I can fetch him , Sir , but I would be loth to make
you turn away your other Page .
You shall not , most sufficient Lady , I will keep
both : pray you let 's go see him .
Whither goes my Love ?
I'le return presently , I go but to see a Page , with
this Lady .
As sure as Fate , 'tis so ; she has opened all : A
pox of all Cockatrices .
Dam ' me , if she have play 'd loose
with me , I'le cut her Thtoat , within a Hairs breadth , so
it may be heal 'd again .
What , is he jealous of his Hermaphrodite ?
O , I , this will be excellent sport .
Phantaste ! Argurion ! what ?
you are suddenly
struck , methinks ! for Loves sake let 's have some Musick
till they come .
Ambition , reach the Lyra , I pray you .
Any thing to which my Honour shall direct me .
Come , Amorphus , chear up Phantaste .
It shall be my pride , fair Lady , to attempt all
that is in my Power .
But here is an Instrument that
( alone ) is able to infuse Soul into the most Melancholick ,
and dull dispos 'd creature upon Earth .
O ! let me kiss thy
fair Knees .
Beauteous Ears attend it .
Will you have the Kiss , Honour ?
I , good Ambition .
S O N G.
O ,
That Joy so soon should waste !
or so sweet a Bliss
as a Kiss ,
Might not for ever last !
So sugred , so melting , so soft , so delicious ,
The Dew that lyes on Roses ,
When the Morn her self discloses ,
is not so precious .
O rather than I would it smother ,
Were I to taste such another ;
It should be my wishing
That I might die kissing .
I made this Ditty , and the Note to it , upon a Kiss
that my Honour gave me ; how like you it , Sir .
A pretty Air ; in general , I like it well : but in
particular , your long die-note did arride me most , but it
was somewhat too long .
I can shew one almost of the
same Nature , but much before it , and not so long , in
a Composition of mine own .
I think I have both the
Note and Ditty about me .
Pray you , Sir , see .
Yes , there is the Note ; and all the parts , if I
mis-think not .
I will read the Ditty to your Beau -
ties here ; but first I am to make you familiar with the
occasion , which presents it self thus .
Upon a time going
to take my leave of the Emperor , and kiss his great
Hands ; there being then present , the Kings of France ,
and Arragon , the Dukes of Savoy , Florence , Orleance ,
Bourbon , Brunswick , the Lantgrave , Count Palatine , all
which had severally feasted me ; besides , infinite more of
inferiour Persons , as Counts and others : it was my
chance ( the Emperor detain 'd by some exorbitant Af -
fair ) to wait him the fifth part of an Hour , or much
near it .
In which time ( retiring my self into a Bay-
window ) the beauteous Lady Annabel , Niece to the
Empress , and Sister to the King of Arragon , who having
never before eyed me , ( but only heard the common re -
port of my Vertue , Learning , and Travel ) fell into that
extremity of Passion , for my love , that she there imme-
diately swooned : Physicians were sent for , she had to
her Chamber , so to her Bed ; where ( languishing some
few Days ) after many times calling upon me , with my
Name in her Lips , she expir 'd .
As that ( I must mourn -
ingly
ingly say ) is the only Fault of my Fortune , that , as it
hath ever been my hap to be sued to , by all Ladies , and
Beauties , where I have come ; so , I never yet sojourn 'd ,
or rested in that place , or part of the World , where
some high-born , admirable , fair Feature died not for
my Love .
O , the sweet power of travel ! are you guiltly
of this , Cupid ?
No, Mercury , and that his Page ( Cos ) knows if
he were here present to be sworn .
But , how doth this draw on the Ditty , Sir ?
O , she is too quick with him ; he hath not de-
vis 'd that yet .
Marry , some hour before she departed , she be-
queath 'd to me this Glove : which golden Legacy , the Em -
peror himself took care to send after me , in six Coaches ,
cover 'd all with black Velvet , attended by the State of
his Empire ; all which he freely presented me with : and
I reciprocally ( out of the same Bounty ) gave to the
Lords that brought it : only reserving the Gift of the
deceas 'd Lady , upon which I compos 'd this Ode , and set
it to my most affected Instrument , the Lyra .
S O N G.
THou more than most sweet Glove ,
Unto my more sweet Love ,
Suffer me to store with Kisses
This empty Lodging that now misses .
The pure rosie hand , that wear thee ,
Whiter then the Kid that bare thee .
Thou art soft , but that was softer ;
Cupid 's self hath kist it ofter ,
Than e 're he did his Mothers Doves ,
Supposing her the Queen of Loves ,
That was thy Mistress ,
Best of Gloves .
Blasphemy , Blasphemy , Cupid .
I , I 'll revenge it time enough , Hermes .
Good Amorphus , let 's hear it sung .
I care not to admit that , since it pleaseth Phi-
lautia to request it .
Here , Sir .
Nay , play it , I pray you , you do well , you do
well ? ?
How like you it , Sir ?
Very well in troth .
But very well ?
O , you are a meer Mammothrept
in Judgment , then .
Why , do you not observe how excel -
lently the Ditty is affected in every place ?
that I do not
marry a Word of short quantity to a long note ?
nor an ascending Syllable to a descending Tone ?
Be-
sides , upon the word ( best ) there , you see how I do en-
ter with an odd minnum , and drive it through the brief ,
which no intelligent Musician ( I know ) but will affirm
to be very rare , extraordinary , and pleasing .
And yet not fit to lament the death of a Lady ,
for all this .
Tut , here be they will swallow any thing .
Pray you , let me have a Copy of it Amorphus .
And me too , in troth , I like it exceedingly .
I have denied it to Princes , nevertheless to you
( the true female Twins of perfection ) I am won to de-
part with all .
I hope , I shall have my Honours Copy .
You are Ambitious in that , Hedon .
How now , Anaides ! what is it hath conjur 'd up
this distemperature in the circle of your Face ?
Why , what have you to do ?
A Pox upo ' your
filthy travelling Face , hold your Tongue .
Nay , do 'st hear , Mischief ?
Away , Musk-cat .
I say to thee , thou art rude , debaucht , impudent ,
course , impolisht , a frapler , and base .
Heart of my Father , what a strange alteration
has half a years haunting of Ordinaries wrought in this
Fellow ! that came with a tuff-taffata Jerkin to Town but
the other day , and a pair of pennyless Hose , and now he is
turn 'd Hercules , he wants but a Club .
Sir , you with the Pencil on your Chin ; I will
garter my Hose with your Guts , and that shall be all .
' Slid , what rare Fire-works be here ?
flash , flash .
What 's the matter Hedon ?
can you tell ?
Nothing , but that he lacks Crowns , and thinks
wee 'll lend him some to be Friends .
Come sweet Lady , in good truth I 'll have it , you
shall not deny me .
Morus , perswade your Aunt I may
have her Picture , by any means .
Yea , Sir : good Aunt now , let him have it , he
will use me the better ; if you love me , do good Aunt .
Well , tell him he shall have it .
Master , you shall have it , she says .
Shall I ?
thank her , good Page .
What , has he entertain 'd the Fool ?
I , hee 'll wait close , you shall see , though the
Begger hang off a while .
Aunt , my Master thanks you .
Call him hither .
Yes , Master .
Yes , in verity , and gave me this Purse , and he
has promis 'd me a most fine Dog ; which he will have
drawn with my Picture , he saies : and desires most ve-
hemently to be known to your Ladiships .
Call him hither , 'tis good groping such a Gull .
Master Asotus , Master Asotus .
For loves sake , let me go : you see , I am call 'd
to the Ladies .
Wilt thou forsake me then ?
God so , what would you have me do ?
Come hither , Master Asotus .
I do ensure your
Ladyships , he is a Gentleman of a very worthy desert :
and of a most bountiful nature .
You must shew and in-
sinuate your self responsible , and equivalent now to my
Good Honors grace him .
I protest ( more than most fair Ladies ) I do wish
all variety of divine Pleasures , choice Sport , sweet Mu-
sick , rich Fare , brave attire , soft Beds , and silken
Thoughts , attend these fair Beauties .
Will it please your
Ladyship to wear this Chain of Pearl , and this Diamond ,
for my sake ?
And you , Madam , this Jewel , and Pendants .
We know not how to deserve these Bounties , out
of so slight merit , Asotus .
No, in faith , but there 's my Glove for a favour .
And soon after the Revels , I will bestow a Garter
on you .
O Lord , Ladies ! it is more grace than ever I
could have hop 'd , but that it pleaseth your Ladyships to
I protest , it is enough , that you but take know -
ledge of my -- if your Ladyships want embroider 'd Gowns ,
Tyres of any Fashion , Rebatues , Jewels , or Carkanets ,
any thing whatsoever , if you vouchsafe to accept .
?
And for it they will help you to Shooe-ties , and
I cannot utter my self ( dear Beauties ) but , you
can conceive ? ?
Sir , we will acknowledge your Service , doubt
not : henceforth , you shall be no more Asotus to us , but
our Gold-finch , and we your Cages .
O Venus , Madams ! how shall I deserve this ?
if I
were but made acquainted with Hedon , now , I 'll try :
pray you away .
How he prays Money to go away from
him !
Amor-
Amorphus , a word with you : here 's a Watch I
would bestow upon you , pray you make me known to
that Gallant .
That I will , Sir . Monsieur Hedon , I must en-
treat you to exchange knowledge with this Gentle -
' Tis a thing ( next to the Water we expect ) I
thirst after , Sir . Good Monsieur Asotus .
Good Monsieur Hedon , I would be glad to be
lov 'd of Men of your Rank and Spirit , I protest .
Please
you to accept this pair of Bracelets , sir : they are not
worth the bestowing ?
O , Hercules , how the Gentleman purchases ! this
must needs bring Argurion to a Consumption .
Sir , I shall never stand in the merit of such
Bounty , I fear .
O Venus , Sir ; your acquaintance shall be suffici-
And if at any time you need my Bill , or my
Bond ? ?
O , O.
Help the Lady there .
Gods dear , Argurion ! Madam , how do you ?
Have her forth , and give her Air .
I come again strait Ladies .
Well , I doubt , all the Physick he has will scarce
recover her : she 's too far spent .
OHere 's the Water come : fetch Glasses , Page .
Heart of my Body , here 's a coil indeed , with
your jealous Humours : Nothing but Whore and Bitch ,
and all the villainous swaggering Names you can think
on ?
' Slid , take your Bottle , and put it in your Guts for
me , I 'll see you poxt ere I follow you any longer .
Nay , good Punk , sweet Rascal ?
dam ' me if I
am jealous now .
That 's true indeed ; pray let 's go .
What 's the matter , there ?
' Slight he has me upon Interrogatories , ( nay , my
Mother shall know how you use me ) where I have been ?
and , why I should stay so long ?
and , how is't possible ?
and withal calls me at his pleasure , I know not how ma -
ny Cockatrices , and things .
In truth and sadness , these are no good Epitaphs ,
Anaides , to bestow upon any Centlewoman ; and I 'll ( en-
sure you ) if I had known you would have dealt thus
with my Daughter , she should never have fancied you
so deeply as she has done .
Go too .
Why , do you hear , Mother Moria .
Heart !
Nay , I pray you , Sir , do not swear .
Swear ?
why ?
I have sworn afore now , I
Both you and your Daughter mistake me .
I have
not honour 'd Arete , that is held the worthiest Lady in
Court ( next to Cynthia ) with half that observance and
respect , as I have done her in private , howsoever out -
wardly I have carried my self careless , and negligent .
Come , you are a foolish Punk , and know not when you
are well employ 'd .
Kiss me , come on ; do it I say .
Nay , indeed , I must confess , she is apt to mis -
But I must have you leave it Minion .
How now , Asotus ?
how do 's the Lady .
Faith , ill .
I have left my Page with her , at her
O here 's the rarest Water that ever was tasted :
fill him some .
What ! has my Master a new Page ?
Yes , a Kinsman , of the Lady Moria 's : you must
wait better now , or you are cashier 'd Prosaites .
Come Gallants you must pardon my foolish hu-
mour : when I am angry , that any thing crosses me , I
grow impatient strait .
Here , I drink to you .
O , that we had five or six Bottles more of this
Now I commend your Judgment , Amorphus ;
who 's that knocks ?
Look , Page .
O , most delicious , a little of this would make
Argurion well .
O , no , give her no cold drink , by any means .
This Water is the spirit of Wine , I 'll be hang 'd else .
Here 's the Lady Arete , Madam .
WHat at your Bever , Gallants ?
Will 't please your Ladyship to drink ?
'tis
of the new Fountain Water .
Not I , Moria , I thank you .
Gallants , you are
for this night free to your peculiar Delights ; Cynthia
will have no Sports : when she is pleas 'd to come forth ,
you shall have knowledge .
In the the mean time , I
could wish you did provide for solemn Revels , and some
unlookt for device of wit , to entertain her , against she
should vouchsafe to grace your Pastimes with her pre -
What say you to a Mask ?
Nothing better if the Project were new , and rare .
Why , I 'll send for Crites , and have his advice ;
be you ready in your endeavours : He shall discharge you
of the Inventive part .
But , will not your Ladyship stay ?
Not now , Phantaste .
Let her go , I pray you , good Lady Sobriety , I
am glad we are rid of her .
What a set Face the Gentlewoman has , as she
were still going to a sacrifice ?
O , she is the extraction of a dozen Puritans ,
for a look .
Of all Nymphs in i' the court , I cannot away with
her ; 'tis the coursest thing ? ?
I wonder how Cynthia can affect her so above the
rest ! Here be they are every way as fair as she , and a
thought fairer , I trow .
I , and as ingenious and conceited as she .
I , and as politick as she , for all she sets such a
fore-head on't .
Would I were dead , if I would change to be
Or I.
Or I.
And there 's her Minion Crites ! why his advice
more than Amorphus ?
have not I invention afore him ?
Learning , to better that invention above him ?
and in-
fanted with pleasant Travel ? ?
Death , what talk you of his Learning ?
he un-
derstands no more than a School-boy ; I have put him
down my self a thousand times ( by this Air ) and yet
I never talkt with him but twice , in my life : you ne -
ver saw his like .
I could never get him to argue with
me , but once , and then , because I could not construe
an Author I quoted at first sight , he went away , and
laught at me .
By Hercules , I scorn him , as I do the sod -
den Nymph , that was here e 'en now , his Mistress Arete :
And I love my self for nothing else .
I wonder the fellow does not hang himself , be-
ing thus scorn 'd , and contemn 'd of us that are held the
most accomplisht Society of Gallants !
By your selves , none else .
I protest , if I had no Musick in me , no Courtship ,
that I were not a Reveller and could dance , or had not
those excellent Qualities that give a Man Life and Per-
M fection ,
fection , but a meer poor Scholar as he is , I think I
should make some desperate way with my self , whereas
now ( would I might never breath more ) if I do know
that Creature in this Kingdom , with whom I would
This is excellent well , I must alter all this soon .
Look you do , Cupid .
The Bottles have wrought ,
it seems .
O , I am sorry the Revels are crost .
I should ha'
tickled it soon .
I did never appear till then .
' Slid , I am
the neatliest-made Gallant i' the Company , and have
the best presence ; and my dancing---well , I know what
our Usher said to me , last time I was at the School :
would I might have led Philautia in the measures , an' it
had been the Gods will .
I am most worthy , I am sure .
Master , I can tell you news , the Lady kist me
yonder , and plaid with me , and says she lov 'd you once ,
as well as she do 's me , but that you cast her off .
Peace , my most esteemed Page .
What luck is this , that our Revels are dasht ?
Now was I beginning to glister , i' the very high-way of
And Cynthia had but seen me dance a strain ,
or do but one trick , I had been kept in Court , I should
never have needed to look towards my Friends agen .
Contain you self , You were a fortunate young
Man , if you knew your own good : which I have now
projected , and will presently multiply upon you .
Beau -
ties , and Valours , your vouchsaf 'd applause to a motion .
The humorous Cynthia hath , for this night , with-drawn
the light of your de-light ? ?
' Tis true Amorphus , what may we do to redeem
it ?
Redeem that we cannot , but to create a new
Flame , is in our Power .
Here is a Gentleman , my Scho-
lar , whom ( for some private Reasons me specially mo-
ving ) I am covetous to gratifie with title of Master , in
the noble , and subtile Science of Courtship : For which
Grace , he shall this night in Court , and in the long
the bare Ac -
cost , the better Regard , the solemn Address , and the per-
fect Close .
What say you ?
Excellent , excellent , Amorphus ,
Well , let us then take our time by the fore-head :
I will instantly have Bills drawn , and advanc 'd in every
Angle of the Court .
Sir , betray not your too much joy .
Anaides , we must mix this Gentleman with you in ac -
quaintance , Monsieur Asotus .
I am easily entreated to grace any of your Friends ,
Sir , and his Friends shall likewise grace you , Sir .
Nay , I begin to know my self , now .
O , you must continue your Bounties .
Must I ?
why , I 'll give him this Ruby on my
Do you hear , Sir ?
I do heartily wish your ac -
quaintance , and I partly know my self worthy of it ; please
you , Sir , to accept this poor Ruby , in a Ring , Sir . The
Poesie is of my own device , Let this blush for me , Sir .
So it must be for me , too .
For I am not asham 'd
to take it .
Sweet man ! by my troth , Master , I love you ,
will you love me too ?
for my Aunts sake ?
I 'll wait
well , you shall see .
I 'll still be here .
Would I might
never stir , but you are a fine Man in these Clothes ,
Master , shall I have 'em , when you have done with them .
As for that , Morus , thou shalt see more hereafter :
in the mean time , by this Air , or by this Feather , I 'll
do as much for thee , as any Gallant shall do for his
Page , whatsoever , in this Court , corner of the World ,
or Kingdom .
I wonder this Gentleman should affect to keep
a Fool ! methinks , he makes sport enough with himself .
Well , Prosaites , 'twere good you did wait closer .
I , I 'll look to it ; 'tis time .
The Revels would have been most sumptuous to
night , if they had gone forward .
They must needs , when all the choisest singula -
rities of the Court were up in Pantofles ; ne 're a one of
them , but was able to make a whole shew of it self .
Sirrah , a torch , a torch .
O , what a call is there ! I will have a Canzonet
made , with nothing in it but Sirrah ; and the burthen
shall be , I come .
How now , Cupid , how do you like this change ?
Faith , the thred of my device is crackt , I may
go sleep till the revelling Musick awake me .
And then too , Cupid , without you had prevent -
ed the Fountain .
Alas , poor God , that remembers not
Self-Love , to be proof against the violence of his Quiver !
Well , I have a Plot upon these Prizers , for which I must
presently find out Crites , and with his assistance , pursue
it to a high strain of Laughter , or Mercury hath lost of
his Mettal .
The Grace divinest Mercury hath done me ,
In this vouchsafed discovery of himself ,
Binds my observance in the utmost terme
Of satisfaction , to his godly Will :
Though I profess ( without the affectation
Of an enforc 'd , and form 'd austerity )
I could be willing to enjoy no place
With so unequal Natures .
We believe it .
But for our sake , and to inflict just pains
On their prodigious Follies , aid us now :
No man is , presently , made bad , with ill .
And good men , like the Sea , should still maintain
Their noble taste , in midst of all fresh humours ,
That flow about them , to corrupt their Streams ,
Bearing no season , much less salt of goodness .
It is our purpose , Crites , to correct ,
And punish , with our laughter , this nights sport .
Which our Court-Dors so heartily intend :
And by that worthy scorn , to make them know
How far beneath the dignity of Man
Out of the Powers of his Divinity ,
Th' offence will be return 'd with weight on me ,
That am a Creature so despis 'd , and poor ;
When the whole Court shall take it self abus 'd
By our Ironical Confederacy .
You are deceiv 'd .
The better Race in Court
Will apprehend it , as a grateful right
Done to their separate merit : and approve
The fit rebuke of so ridiculous Heads ,
Who with their apish Customs , and forc 'd Garbs ,
Would bring the name of Courtier in contempt ,
Did it not live unblemisht in some few ,
Whom equal Jove hath lov 'd , and Ph?bus
form 'd
Of better Metal , and in better mould .
Well , since my leader on is Mercury ,
I shall not fear to follow .
If I fall ,
My proper Vertue shall be my relief ,
That follow 'd such a cause , and such a chief .
compatible to live withal : Send me for the La -
Nay , but intend me .
Fear me not , I warrant you , Sir .
Render not your self a refractary , on the sud-
I can allow well , you should repute highly , hear-
tily ( and to the most ) of your own Endowments ; it
gives you forth to the World the more assur 'd : but with
reservation of an Eye , to be always turn 'd dutifully
back upon your Teacher .
Nay , good Sir , leave it to me .
Trust me with
trussing all the Points of this action , I pray .
' Slid , I
hope we shall find Wit to perform the Science , as well
as another .
I confess you to be of an aped and docile Hu-
Yet there are certain puntilioes , or ( as I may
more nakedly insinuate them ) certain intrinsecate strokes ,
and wards , to which your activity is not yet amounted .
As your gentile dor in Colours .
For supposition , your
Mistress appears here in prize , Ribbanded with green and
yellow ; now it is the part of every obsequious Servant ,
to be sure to have daily about him Copy , and variety of
Colours , to be presently answerable to any hourly or
half hourly change in his Mistresses Revolution .
( I know it , Sir .
Give leave , I pray you ) which if your Antago -
nist , or Player-against-you , shall ignorantly be without ,
and your self can produce ; you give him the dor .
I , I , Sir .
Or , if you can possess your opposite , that the
green your Mistress wears , is her rejoycing or exultation
in his Service ; the yellow , suspicion of his truth , ( from
her height of affection : ) and that he ( greenly credu-
lous ) shall withdraw thus , in private , and from the a -
bundance of his Pocket ( to displace her jealous Con-
ceit ) steal into his Hat the Colour , whose blueness doth
express trueness , ( she being nor so , nor so affected ) you
give him the dor .
Do not I know it , Sir ?
Nay , good ?
swell not above your under-
There is yet a third dor in Colours .
I know it too , I know it .
Do you know it too ?
what is it ?
Make good
your knowledg .
Why it is ? ?
no matter for that .
Do it , on p ?ne
of the dor .
Why ; what is't , say you ?
Lo , you have given your self the dor .
But I
will remonstrate to you the third dor ; which is not , as
the two former dors , indicative , but deliberative : As
how ?
As thus .
Your Rivalis , with a dutiful and serious
care , lying in his Bed , meditating how to observe his
Mistress , dispatcheth his Lacquey to the Chamber ,
early , to know what her Colours are for the day , with
purpose to apply his wear that day accordingly : You
lay wait before , Preoccupy the Chamber-maid , Cor-
rupt her , to return false Colours ; He follows the falla -
cy ; comes out accoutred to his believ 'd Instructions ;
your Mistress smiles ; and you give him the dor .
Why , so I told you , Sir , I knew it .
Told me ?
It is a strange outrecuidance ! your
humour too much redoundeth .
Why , Sir , what , do you think you know more ?
I know that a Cook may as soon and properly
be said to smell well , as you to be wise .
I know these
are most clear and clean strokes .
But then , you have
your Passages and imbroccata 's in Courtship ; as the bitter
Bob in Wit ; the Reverse in Face or Wry-mouth ; and
these more subtil and secure Offenders .
I will example
unto you ; your Opponent makes entry , as you are
ingag 'd with your Mistress .
You seeing him , close in
her Ear with this whisper ( here comes your Babion , dis -
grace him ) and withal , stepping off , fall on his Bosom ,
and turning to her , politickly , aloud say , Lady , regard
this Noble Gentleman , a Man rarely parted , second to
none in this Court ; and then , stooping over his Shoul-
der , your Hand on his Brest , your Mouth on his Back -
side , you give him the Reverse stroke , with this Sanna ,
or Storks-bill , which makes up your Wits Bob most
Nay , for Heavens sake , teach me no more .
Iknow all as well ?
' Slid , if I did not , why was I no-
minated ?
why did you chuse me ?
why did the Ladies
prick out me ?
I am sure there were other Gallants .
But me of all the rest ?
by that light , and as I am a
Courtier , would I might never stir , but 'tis strange .
Would to the Lord the Ladies would come once .
Jeweller , &c .
SIgnior , the Gallants and Ladies are at hand .
Are
you ready , Sir ?
Go , accomplish your Attire : Cousin
Morphides , assist me , to make good the Door with your
officious Tyranny .
By your leave my Masters there , pray you let 's
come by .
You by ?
why should you come by more than
we ?
Why , Sir ?
Because he is my Brother that plays
the Prizes .
Your Brother ?
I , her Brother , Sir , and we must come in .
Why , what are you ?
I am her Husband , Sir .
Then thrust forward your Head .
What Tumult is there ?
Who 's there ?

This Country Lady , my Friend , good Signior
And my Cockatrice here .
She is welcom .
Knock those same Pages there ; and Goodman

With whom ?
your Brother ?
Who is your Brother ?
Master Asotus ?
Is he your Brother ?
He is ta -

He is not to know you to
O Jove , Master ! an' there come e 're a Citizen
Gentlewoman in my name , let her have entrance , I
pray you .
It is my Sister .

Nay , good Sir ; It is my Husband .
The simpler Fellow he .

I 'll come home

soon with my Sister , pray you meet us with a Lanthorn ,
Be merry , Sister : I shall make you laugh anon .
Your Prizer is not ready Amorphus .
Apprehend your places , he shall be soon ; and
at all points .
Is there any body come to answer him ?
Shall
we have any sport ?
Sport of importance ; howsoever , give me the
Gloves ! why Gloves , Signior ?
What 's the Ceremony ?
Beside their receiv 'd fitness , at all Prizes , they
are here properly accomodate to the Nuptials of my
Schollars 'haviour to the Lady Courtship .
Please you ap -
parel your hands .
Madam Phantaste , Madam Philautia ,
Guardian , Signior Heden , Signior Anaides , Gentlemen all ,
Thanks , good Amorphus .
I will now call forth my Provost , and present
Heart ! why should not we be Masters , as well
as he ?
That 's true , and play our Masters prizes , as well
as the t 'other ?
In sadness , for using your Court-weapons , me-
thinks you may .
Nay , but why should not we Ladies play our
Prizes , I pray ?
I see no reason , but we should take 'em
down at their own Weapons .
Troth , and so we may , if we handle 'em well .
I indeed , forsooth , Madam , if 'twere i' the Ci-
ty , we would think foul scorn , but we would , forsooth .
Pray you , what should we call your name ?
My name is Downfal .
Good Mistress Downfal ! I am sorry your Hus -
band could not get in .
' Tis no matter for him , Sir .
No, no , she has the more liberty for her self .
Peace , peace : They come .
So , Keep up your Ruff : the Tincture of your
Neck is not all so pure , but it will ask it .
Maintain your
sprig upright ; your Cloke on your half-shoulder falling ;
So : I will read your Bill , advance it , and present
The C H A L L E N G E.
BE it known to all that profess Courtship , by these Pre -
sents ( from the white sattin Reveller , to the Cloth of
Tissue and Bodkin , ) that we , Ulysses-Politropus-Amorphus ,
Master of the noble and subtil Science of Courtship , do give
leave and license to our Provost , Acolastus-Polypragmon -
Asotus , to play his Masters Prize , against all Masters what -
soever in this subtile Mystery , at these four , the choice and
most cunning Weapons of Court complement , viz .
the bare
Accost ; the better Reguard ; the solemn Address ; and
the perfect Close .
These are therefore to give notice to all
comers , that he , the said Acolastus-Polypragmon-Asotus ,
is here present ( by the help of his Mercer , Taylor , Millener ,
Sempster , and so forth ) at his designed hour , in this fair
Gallery , the present day of this present month , to perform
and do his uttermost for the atchievement and bearing away of
the Prizes , which are these : viz .
For the bare Accost , two
Wall-eyes , in a face forced : For the better Reguard , a
Face fovourably simpring , with a Fan waving : For the
solemn Address , two Lips wagging , and never a wise word :
For the perfect Close , a Wring by the hand , with a Ban-
quet in a corner .
And Ph?bus
save Cynthia .
Appeareth no Man yet , to answer the Prizer ?
No
voyce ?
Musick , give them their Summons .
The solemnity of this is excellent .
Well , I perceive your name is their Ter-
ror ; and keepeth them back .
I faith , Master , let 's go : no body comes .
Victus , victa , victum ; Victi , vict? , victi ? ?

That were dispunct to the Ladies .
Ra -
ther , our self shall be your Encounter .
Take your
state up to the Wall : And , Lady , may we implore you
to stand forth , as first term or bound to our Courtship .
' Fore Heaven , 'twill shew rarely .
Sound a charge .
A pox on't .
Your vulgar will count this fabu-
lous and impudent , now : by that Candle they 'll ne 'er
conceit it .
Excellent well ! admirable !
They act their
Accost severally
to the Lady that
stands forth .
Most fashionably , believe it .
O , he is a well-spoken Gentleman .
Now the other .
Very good .
For a Schollar , Honor .
O , 'tis too dutch .
He reels too much .
This Weapon is done .
No, we have our two bouts , at every Weapon ,
WHere be these Gallants , and their brave Prizer
here ?
Who 's there ?
bear back : Keep the Door .
What are you , Sir ?
By your License , Grand-master .
Come forward ,
Heart ! who let in that Rag there , amongst us ?
put him out , an impecunious Creature .
Out with him .
Come , Sir .
You must be retrograde .
Soft , Sir , I am Truchman , and do flourish before
this Monsieur , or French-behav 'd Gentleman , here ; who
is drawn hither by report of your Chartels , advanced in
Court , to prove his fortune with your Prizer , so he may
have fair play shewn him , and the liberty to choose his
Is he a Master ?
That , Sir , he has to shew here ; and , confirmed
under the hands of the most skilful and cunning Com -
plementaries alive : please you read , Sir .
What shall we do ?
Death , disgrace this fellow i' the black-stuff ,
whatever you do .
Why , but he comes with the stranger .
That 's no matter .
He is our own Countryman .
I , and he is a Schollar besides .
You may dis -
grace him here with Authority .
Well , see these first .
Now shall I be observ 'd by yon 'd Schollar , till I
sweat again ; I would to Jove it were over .
Sir , this is the wight of worth , that dares you
to the Encounter .
A Gentleman of so pleasing and ri-
diculous a Carriage ; as , even standing , carries Meat
in the Mouth , you see ; and I assure you , although
no bred courtling , yet a most particular Man , of goodly
havings , well fashion 'd 'haviour , and of as hard 'ned
and excellent a Bark , as the most naturally qualified a -
mongst them , inform 'd , reform 'd , and transform 'd ,
from his original Citycism ; by this Elixir , or meet
Magazine of Man .
And , for your Spectators , you be-
hold them what they are : The most choice particulars
in Court : This tells Tales well ; This provides Coaches ;
This repeats Jests ; This presents Gifts ; This holds up
the Arras ; This takes down from Horse ; This protests
by this Light ; This swears by that Candle ; This De-
lighteth ;
lighteth ; This Adoreth .
Yet all but three Men .
Then
for your Ladies , the most proud witty Creatures , all
things apprehending , nothing understanding , perpetu-
ally laughing , curious maintainers of Fools , Mercers ,
and Minstrels , costly to be kept , miserably keeping , all
disdaining , but their Painter , and Apothecary , 'twixt
whom and them there is this reciprock Commerce , their
Beauties maintain their Painters , and their Painters their
Sir , you have plaid the Painter your self , and
limb 'd them to the Life .
I desire to deserve before 'em .
This is Authentick .
We must resolve to enter-
tain the Monsieur , howsoever we neglect him .
Come , let 's all go together , and salute him .
Content , and not look o ' the other .
Well devis 'd : and a most punishing disgrace .
We must not so much betray our
selves to discourtship , as to suffer you to be longer unsa -
luted : Please you to use the State , ordain 'd for the Op-
ponent ; in which nature , without Envy we receive you .
And embrace you .
And commend us to you , Sir .
Believe it , he is a Man of excellent silence .
Out of all emphasis .
The Monsieur sees we regard
him not .
Hold on : make it known how bitter a thing it
is , not to be lookt on in Court .
' Slud , will he call him to him yet ?
do 's not
Monsieur perceive our disgrace ?
Heart ! he is a Fool , I see .
We have done our
selves wrong to grace him .
' Slight , what an Ass was I to embrace him ?
Illustrous and fearful Judges ? ?
Turn away , turn away .
It is the sute of the strange Opponent ( to whom
you ought not to turn your Tails , and whose Noses I
must follow ) that he may have the Justice , before he
encounter his respected Adversary , to see some light
stroke of his Play , commenc 'd with some other .
Answer not him , but the stranger , we will not
believe him .
I will demand him my self .
O dreadful disgrace , if a Man were so foolish
to feel it !
Is it your suit , Monsieur , to see some pr?lude of
my Schollar ?
Now , sure the Monsieur wants Language !
And take upon him to be one of the accom -
plish't ?
' Slight , that 's a good Jest : would we could
take him with that nullity .
Non sapette voi parlar ' Ita -
gliano ?
'Sfoot , the Carp has no Tongue .
Signior , in Courtship , you are to bid your abet-
tors forbear , and satisfie the Monsieurs request .
Well , I will strike him more silent , with admi-
ration , and terrifie his daring hither .
He shall behold
my own play , with my Schollar .
Lady , with the touch
of your white Hand , let me re-enstate you .
Provost ,
begin to me , at the bare Accost .
Now , for the honour
of my discipline .
Signior Amorphus , reflect , reflect : what means
he by that mouthed wave ?
He is in some distaste of your Fellow-disciple .
Signior , your Schollar might have plaid well still ,
if he could have kept his seat longer : I have enough of
him , now .
He is a meer piece of Glass , I see through
him , by this time .
You come not to give us the scorn , Mon -
sieur ?
Nor to be frighted with a Face .
Signior ! I have
seen the Lyons .
You must pardon me .
I shall be loth
to hazard a Reputation with one that has not a Reptati-
on to lose .
How !
Meaning you Pupil , Sir .
This is that black Devil there .
You do offer a strange affront , Monsieur .
Sir , he shall yield you all the honour of a com-
petent Adversary , if you please to undertake him ?
I am prest for the Encounter .
Me ?
challenge me ?
What ! my Master , Sir ?
' Slight , Monsieur , med -
dle with me , do you hear ?
but do not meddle with my
Peace , good squib , go out .
And stink , he bids you .
Master ?
Silence , I do accept him .
Sit you down , and
Me ?
He never profest a thing at more Char-
Prepare your self , Sir . Challenge me ?
I will pro-
secute what disgrace my hatred can dictate to me .
How tender a Travellers spleen is ?
comparison ,
to Men , that deserve least , is ever most offensive .
You are instructed in our Chartell , and know
our Weapons ?
I appear not without their notice , Sir .
But must I lose the Prizes , Master ?
I will win them for you , be patient .
Lady ,
vouchsafe the Tenure of this Ensign .
Who shall be
your stickler ?
Behold him .
I would not wish you a weaker .
Sound Mu-
I provoke you , at the bare Accost .
Excellent comely !
And worthily studied .
This is th ' exalted Fore -
O , his Leg was too much produc 'd .
And his Hat was carried skirvily .
Peace ; Let 's see the Monsieur 's Accost : Rare !
Sprightly , and short .
True , it is the French courteau : He lacks but to
have his Nose slit .
He does hop .
He does bound too much .
The second bout , to conclude this Weapon .
Good , Believe it !
An excellent offer !
This is call 'd the solemn band-string .
Foh , that Cringe was not put home .
He makes a Face like a stab 'd Lucrece .
Well , he would needs take it upon him , but
would I had done it for all this .
He makes me sit still
here , like a Babioun as I am .
Making villanous Faces .
See , the French prepares it richly .
I , this is ycleped the serious trifle .
' Slud , 'tis the horse-start out o ' the brown study .
Rather the Bird-ey 'd stroke , Sir . Your obser-
vance is too blunt , Sir .
Judges , award the Prize .
Take breath , Sir .
This bout hath been laborious .
And yet your Critick , or your Besso'gno , will
think these things foppery , and easie , now .
Or rather meer Lunacy .
For would any reaso-
nable Creature make these his serious Studies and Per-
fections ?
Much less , only live to these ends ?
to be the
false Pleasure of a few , the true Love of none , and the
just laughter of all ?
We must prefer the Monsieur , we Courtiers must
be partial .
Speak , Guardian .
Name the Prize , at the bare
A pair of Wall-eyes in a face forced .
Give the Monsieur .
Amorphus hath lost his Eyes .
I ! is the Palate of your Judgment down ?
Gen-
tiles , I do appeal .
Yes , Master , to me .
The Judges be Fools .
How now , Sir ?
Tye up your Tongue , Mun-
He cannot appeal .
Say you , Sir ?
Sit you still , Sir .
Why , so I do .
Do not I , I pray you ?
Remercy , Madam , and these honourable Censors .
Well , to the second Weapon , the better Reguard :
I will encounter you better .
Sweet Honour .
What says my good Ambition ?
Which take you at this next Weapon ?
I lay a
discretion , with you , on Amorphus 's Head .
Why , I take the French-behav 'd Gentleman .
' Tis done , a discretion .
A discretion ?
A pretty Court-wager ! would any
discreet person hazard his Wit , so ?
I 'll lay a discretion with you , Anaides .
Hang 'em .
I 'll not venture a doit of discretion
on either of their Heads ? ?
No, he should venture all then .
I like none of their Plays .
See , see , this is strange play !
' Tis too full of uncertain motion .
He hobbles
too much .
Tis call 'd your Court-staggers , Sir .
That same fellow talks so , now he has a Place .
Hang him , neglect him .
Your good Ladiships affectioned .
Gods so ! they speak at this Weapon , Brother !
They must do so , Sister , how should it be the
better Reguard , else ?
Methinks he did not this respectively enough .
Why , the Monsieur but dallies with him .
Dallies ?
' Slight see , he 'll put him too't , in ear-
Well done Amorphus .
That puff was good indeed .
Gods me ! This is desperate play .
He hits him -
self o ' the Shins .
An' he make this good through , he carries it ,
I warrant him .
Indeed he displays his Feet , rarely .
See , see : He does the respective Leere damna -
bly well .
The true idolater of your Beauties , shall never pass
their Deities unadored : I rest your poor Knight .
See , now the oblique Leere , or the Janus : He sa -
tisfies all with that aspect most nobly .
And most terribly he comes off : like your Rodo -
How like you this Play , Anaides ?
Good play ; but 'tis too rough and boisterous .
I will second it with a stroke easier , wherein I
will prove his Language .
This is filthy , and grave , now .
O , 'tis cool and wary Play .
We must not dis -
grace our own camerade , too much .
Signora , ho tanto obligo per ye favore rescinto da

Most unexspectedly excellent ! The French goes

O brave , and spirited ! He 's a right Jovialist .
No, no : Amorphus 's Gravity outways it .
And yet your Lady , or your Feather would
outweigh both .
What 's the Prize , Lady , at this better Reguard ?
A Face favourably simpring , and a Fan waving .
They have done doubtfully .

favourable Face to the Signior , and the Light wave to the
You become the Simper well , Lady .
And the Wag , better .
Now , to our solemn Address .
Please the Well -
grac 'd Philautia to relieve the Lady Sentinel ; she hath
stood long .
With all my Heart ; come Guardian ; resign your
Monsieur , furnish your self with what solemni-
ty of Ornament you think fit for this third Weapon ; at
which you are to shew all the cunning of stroke your
Devotion can possibly devise .
Let me alone , Sir . I 'll sufficiently decypher your
amorous Solemnities .
Crites , have patience .
See , if I
hit not all their practick observance , with which they
Lime-twigs , to catch their phantastick Lady-birds .
I , but you should do more charitably , to do it
more openly : that they might discover themselves
mockt in these monstrous Affections .
Lacquey , where 's the Taylor ?
Here , Sir .
See , they have their Taylor , Barber , Perfumer ,
Millener , Jeweller , Feather-maker , all in common !
I , this is pretty .
Here is a Hair too much , take it off .
Where
are thy Mullets ?
Is this Pink of equal proportion to this cut ,
standing of this distance from it ?
That it is , Sir .
Is it so , Sir , you impudent Poultroun ?
you Slave ,
you List , you Shreds , you ? ?
This was the best , yet .
Why , we must use our Taylors thus .
This is our
true Magnanimity .
Come , go to : put on .
We must bear with you ,
for the times sake .
Is the Perfume rich , in this Jerkin ?
Tast , smell ; I assure you Sir , pure Beniamin , the
only spirited scent , that ever awak't a Neapolitane Nostril .
You would wish your self all Nose , for the love on't .
Ifrotted a Jerkin , for a new-revenu 'd Gentleman , yield -
ed me Threescore Crowns , but this Morning , and the
same Titillation .
I favour no sampsuchine , in it ,
I am a nulli-fidian , if there be not three thirds of a
scruple more of sampsuchinum , in this Confection , than
ever I put in any .
I 'll tell you all the Ingredients , Sir .
You shall be simple to discover your simples .
Simple ?
why Sir ?
what reck ' I to whom I dis -
cover ?
I have in it Musk , Civit , Amber , Ph ?nicobalanus ,
the Decoction of Turmerick , Sesana , Nard , Spikenard , Ca -
lamus odoratus , Stacte , Opobalsamum , Amomum , Storax , La -
danum , Aspalathum , Opopanax , Oenanthe .
And what of
all these now ?
what are you the better ?
Tut , it is the
sorting , and the dividing , and the mixing , and the tem -
pring , and the searching , and the decocting , that makes
the fumigation , and the suffumigation .
Well , indue me with it .
I will , Sir .
An excellent Confection .
And most worthy a true Voluptary .
Jove !
what a Coyl these Musk-Worms take , to purchase ano -
thers delight ?
for , themselves , who bear the Odors , have
ever the least sence of them .
Yet , I do like better the
prodigality of Jewels , and Clothes , whereof one pas -
seth to a Mans Heirs ; the other , at least wears out time .
This presently expires , and without continual riot in
reparation is lost : which whoso strives to keep , it is one
special argument to me , that ( affecting to smell better
than other Men ) he doth indeed smell far worse .
I know , you will say it sits well , Sir .
Good faith , if it do not , Sir , let your Mistress be
By Heaven , if my Mistress do not like it , I 'll
make no more Conscience to undo thee , than to undo
an Oyster .
Believe it , there 's ne 'ere a Mistress i' the World
can mislike it .
No, not Goodwife Taylor , your Mistress ;
that has only the Judgment to heat your Pressing-
But for a Court-Mistress , that studies these Deco -
rums , and knows the proportion of every cut , to a hair ,
knows why such a Colour is cut upon such a Colour ,
and , when a Satten is cut upon six Taffataes , will look
that we should dive into the depth of the cut ?
Give me
my Scarfe .
Shew some Ribbands , sirrah .
Ha' you the
I , Sir .
Ha' you the Jewel ?
Yes , Sir .
What must I give for the hire on't ?
You 'll give me six Crowns , Sir ?
Six Crowns ! By Heaven twere a good deed to
borrow it of thee to shew : and never let thee have it
I hope your Worship will not do so Sir .
By Jove , Sir , there be such tricks stirring , I can
tell you , and worthily too .
Extorting Knaves , that live
by these Court-decorums , and yet ?
What 's your Jewel
worth I pray .
A hundred Crowns , Sir .
A hundred Crowns ?
And six for the loan on't
an hour ?
What 's that i' the hundred for the year ?
These
Impostors would not be hang 'd ?
your Thief is not com-
parable to 'em , by Hercules ; well , put it in , and the Fea -
ther ; you will ha't and you shall ; and the Pox give you
good on't .
Give me my Confects , my Moscardini , and place
those Colours in my Hat .
These are Bolognian Ribbands , I warrant you .
In truth , Sir : if they be not right Granado Silk ?
A Pox on you , you 'll all say so .
You give me not a Penny , Sir .
Come Sir , perfume my Devant ; May it ascend ,
like solemn Sacrifice , into the Nostrils of the Queen of Love .
Your French Ceremonies are the best .
Monsieur , Signior , your solemn Address is too long .
The Ladies long to have you come on .
Soft , Sir , our coming on is not so easily prepared
Signior Fig .
I , Sir .
Can you help my Complexion , here ?
O yes , Sir , I have an excellent mineral Fucus
for the purpose .
The Gloves are right , Sir , you shall
bury 'em in a Muck-hill , a draught , seven years , and
take 'em out , and wash 'em , they shall still retain
their first scent , true Spanish .
There 's Ambre i' the
Your Price , sweet Fig .
Give me what you will , Sir : The Signior pays
me two Crowns a pair ; you shall give me your Love ,
My Love ?
with a Pox to you , Goodman Sasafras .
I come , Sir . There 's an excellent Diapasm in a
Chain too , if you like it .
Stay , what are the Ingredients to your Fucus ?
Nought but Sublimate , and crude Mercury , Sir ,
well prepar 'd and dulcified , with the Jaw-bones of a
Sow , burnt , beaten , and searced .
I approve it .
Lay it on .
I 'll have your Chain of Pomander , sirrah ; what 's
your price ?
Wee 'll agree , Monsieur ; I 'll assure you , it was both
decocted and dryed , where no Sun came , and kept in
an Onyx ever since it was ball 'd .
Come , invert my Mustachio , and we have done .
' Tis good .
Hold still I pray you , Sir .
Nay the Fucus is exorbitant , Sir .
Death ! dost thou burn me , Harlot ?
I beseech you , Sir .
Begger , Varlet , Poultroun ?
Excellent , excellent !
Your French Beat is the most natural Beat of the
O that I had plaid at this Weapon .
Peace , now they come on ; the second part .
Madam , your Beauties being so attractive , I
muse you are left thus alone .
Better be alone , Sir , than ill-accompanied .
Nought can be ill , Lady , that can come near
your Goodness .
Sweet Madam , on what part of you soever a
man casts his Eye , he meets with perfection ; you are
the lively Image of Venus , throughout ; all the Graces
smile in your Cheeks ; your Beauty nourishes , as well
as delights ; you have a Tongue steept in Honey ; and a
Breath like a Panther : your Breasts and Forehead are
whiter than Goats Milk , or May-blossoms ; a Cloud is
not so soft as your Skin .
Well strook , Monsieur : he charges like a French -
man indeed , thick , and hotly .
Your Cheeks are Cupids Baths , wherein he uses
to steep himself in Milk and Nectar : He do 's light all
his Torches at your Eyes , and instructs you how to shoot ,
and wound , with their Beams .
Yet I love nothing , in
you , more than your innocence ; you retain so native
a simplicity , so unblam 'd a behaviour .
Methinks , with
such a Love , I should find no Head , nor Foot of my
pleasure : You are the very Spirit of a Lady .
Fair play , Monsieur you are too hot on the Quar-
Give your Competitor Audience .
Lady , how stirring soever the Monsieurs Tongue
is , he will lie by your side , more dull than your Eunuch .
A good stroke ; that mouth was excellently put
You are fair , Lady ? ?
You offer foul , Signior , to close , keep your di-
stance ; for all your Bravo rampant here .
I say you are fair , Lady , let your choice be fit ,
as you are fair .
I say , Ladies do never believe they are fair , till
some Fool begins to dote upon 'em .
You play too rough , Gentlemen .
Your Frenchified Fool is your only Fool , Lady :
I do yield to this honourable Monsieur , in all civil , and
human Courtesie .
Give him the Prize .
Give him the
Prize ; that mouth , again , was most courtly hit , and rare .
I knew I should pass upon him with the bitter Bob .
O , but the Reverse was singular .
It was most subtile , Amorphus .
If I had do n't , it should have been better .
How heartily they applaud this , Crites !
You suffer 'em too long .
I 'll take off their edge instantly .
Name the Prize , at the solemn Address .
Two
Two Lips wagging .
And never a wise Word ; I take it .
Give to Amorphus .
And , upon him again ; let
him not draw free breath .
Thanks fair Deliverer , and my honourable
Judges ; Madam Phantaste , you are our worthy object
at this next Weapon .
Most coveting ready , Amorphus .
Your Monsieur is crest-faln .
So are most of 'em once a year .
You will see , I shall now give him the gentle dor ,
presently , he forgetting to shift the Colours , which are
now chang 'd with alteration of the Mistress .
At your
last Weapon , Sir . The perfect Close .
Set forward , intend
your approach , Monsieur .
' Tis yours Signior .
With your example , Sir .
Not I , Sir .
It is your right .
By no possible means .
You have the way .
As I am Noble ? ?
As I am Virtuous ?
Pardon me , Sir .
I will die first .
You are a Tyrant in Courtesie .
He is remov 'd ?
Judges , bear witness .
What of that , Sir ?
You are remov 'd , Sir .
I challenge you ; you have receiv 'd the Dor .
Give
me the Prize .
Soft , Sir . How the Dor ?
The common Mistress , you see is changed .
Right , Sir .
And you have still in your Hat the former Colours .
You lye , Sir , I have none : I have pull 'd 'em
I meant to play discolour 'd .
The Dor , the Dor , the Dor , the Dor , the Dor ! the
palpable Dor .
Heart of my Blood , Amorphus , what ha' you done ?
stuck a disgrace upon us all , and at your last Weapon ?
I could have done no more .
By Heaven , it was most unfortunate luck .
Luck ! by that Candle , it was meer rashness , and
oversight ; would any Man have ventured to play so open
and forsake his Ward ?
Dam ' me if he have not eternal-
nally undone himself , in Court ; and discountenanc 'd
us , that were his main countenance , by it .
Forgive it now .
It was the Solecism of my Stars .
The Wring of the Hand , and the Banquet , is ours .
O , here 's a Lady feels like a Wench of the first
year ; you would think her Hand did melt in your
touch ; and the Bones of her fingers ran out at length ,
when you prest 'em , they are so gently delicate ! He that
had the grace to print a kiss on these Lips , should taste
Wine , and Rose leaves .
O , she kisses as close as a Cockle .
Let 's take 'em down , as deep as our Hearts , Wench , till
our very Souls mix .
Adieu , Signior : Good faith I shall
drink to you at Supper , Sir .
Stay , Monsieur .
Who awards you the Prize .
Why , his proper merit , Sir : you see he has plaid
down your grand Garb-master , here .
That 's not in your Logick to determine , Sir : you
are no Courtier .
This is none of your seven , or nine
beggerly Sciences , but a certain mystery above 'em where -
in we that have Skill must pronounce , and not such fresh -
men as you are .
Indeed , I must declare my self to you no profest
Courtling ; nor to have any excellent stroke , at your
subtil Weapons : yet if you please , I dare venture a hit
with you , or your fellow , Sir Dagonet , here .
With me ?
Yes , Sir .
Heart , I shall never have such a fortune to save
my self in a fellow again , and your two Reputations ,
Gentlemen , as in this .
I 'll undertake him .
Do , and swinge him soundly , good Anaides .
Let me alone , I 'll play other manner of play , than
has been seen yet .
I would the Prize lay on't .
It shall if you will , I forgive my right .
Are you so confident ?
what 's your Weapon ?
At any , I , Sir .
The perfect close , that 's now the best .
Content I 'll pay your scholarity .
Who offers ?
Marry , that will I : I dare give you that ad-
vantage too .
You dare ?
Well , look to your liberal Skonce .
Make your play still , upon the answer , Sir .
Hold your Peace , you are a Hobby-horse .
Sit by me , Master .
Now Crites strike home .
You shall see me undo the assur 'd Swaggerer with
a trick , instantly : I will play all his own Play before
him ; court the Wench in his Garb , in his Phrase , with
his Face ; leave him not so much as a Look , an Eye , a
Stalk , or an imperfect Oath , to express himself by , af -
ter me .
Excellent , Crites .
When begin you , Sir ?
Have you consulted ?
To your cost , Sir ; which is the Piece stands forth
to be courted ?
O , are you she ?
Well , Madam , or sweet
Lady , it is so , I do love you in some sort , do you con-
ceive ?
and though I am no Monsieur , nor no Signior ,
and do want ( as they say ) Logick and Sophistry , and good
Words , to tell you why it is so ; yet by this Hand , and
by that Candle it is so : And though I be no Book -
worm , nor one that deals by Art , to give you Rhetorick
and Causes , why it should be so , or make it good it is so .
yet dam me , but I know it is so , and am assur 'd it is so ,
and I and my Sword shall make it appear it is so ; and
give you reason sufficient how it can be no otherwise ,
but so ?
' Slight Anaides , you are mockt ; and so we are
How now , Signior ! What suffer your self to be
couzen 'd of your Courtship , before your Face ?
This is plain Confederacy , to disgrace us : Let 's
be gone , and plot some revenge .
When men disgraces share ,
The lesser is the care .
Nay , stay , my dear Ambition , I can do you over too
You that tell your Mistress , Her Beauty is all compos 'd .
of theft : her Hair stole from Apollo 's Goldy-locks ; her
White and Red , Lillies and Roses stoln out of Paradise ;
her Eyes two Stars , pluckt from the Sky ; her Nose the
Gnomon of Loves Dial , that tells you how the Clock of
your Heart goes : And for her other parts , as you cannot
reckon 'em , they are so many ; so you cannot recount
them , they are so manifest .
Yours , if his own , unfortu-
nate Hoyden , in stead of Hedon .
Sister come away , I cannot endure 'em longer .
Go Dors , and you , my Madam Courting-stocks ,
Follow your scorned .
and derided Mates ;
Tell to your guilty Breasts , what meer gilt Blocks
You are , and how unworthy humane states .
Now , Sacred God of Wit , if you can make
Those , whom our sports tax in these apish Graces ,
Kiss ( like the fighting Snakes ) your Peaceful Rod ;
These times shall canonize you for a God .
Why Crites , think you any noble Spirit ,
Or any , worth the title of a Man ,
Will be incens 'd to see the inchanted Vails
Of Self-conceit , and servile Flattery ,
( Wrapt in so many Folds , by time and custom )
Drawn from his wronged , and bewitched Eyes ?
Who sees not now their shape , and nakedness ,
Is
Is blinder than the Son of Earth , the Mole ;
Crown 'd with no more Humanity , nor Soul .
Though they may see it , yet the huge Estate
Phansie , and Form , and sensual Pride have gotten ,
Will make them blush for anger , not for shame ,
And turn shewn Nakedness to Impudence .
Humour is now the Test we try things in :
All Power is just : Nought that delights is Sin .
And yet the Zeal of every knowing Man
( Opprest with Hills of Tyranny , cast on Vertue
By the light Phant 'sies of Fools , thus transported )
Cannot but vent the ?tna of his Fires ,
T'enflame best Bosoms with much worthier Love
Than of these outward and effeminate Shades ;
That these vain Joys , in which their Wills consume
Such Powers of Wit and Soul as are of force
To raise their Beings to Eternity ,
May be converted on Works fitting Men :
And , for the practice of a forced Look ,
An antick Gesture , or a fustian Phrase ,
Study the native frame of a true Heart ,
An inward Comliness of Bounty , Knowledge ,
And Spirit , that may conform them actually
To Gods high Figures , which they have in power ;
Which to neglect for a self-loving neatness ,
Is Sacrilege of an unpardo n 'd greatness .
Then let the Truth of these things strengthen thee ,
In thy exempt , and only Man-like Course ;
Like it the more , the less it is respected :
Though Men fail , Vertue is by Gods protected .
See , here comes Arete , I 'll withdraw my self .
' Tis Cynthia 's pleasure .
How , bright Arete !
Why , 'twere a Labour more for Hercules ;
Better and sooner durst I undertake
To make the different Seasons of the Year ,
The Winds , or Elements , to sympathize ,
Than their unmeasurable Vanity
Dance truly in a Measure .
They agree ?
What though all Concord 's born of Contraries ?
So many Follies will Confusion prove ,
And like a sort of jarring Instruments ,
All out of tune ; because ( indeed ) we see
There is not that Analogy 'twixt Discords ,
As between things but meerly opposite .
There is your Error : For as Hermes Wand
Charms the Disorders of tumultuous Ghosts ;
And as the Strife of Chaos then did cease ,
When better Light than Nature 's did arrive :
So , what could never in it self agree ,
Forgetteth the Eccentrick Property ,
And at her sight turns forthwith Regular ,
Whose Scepter guides the flowing Ocean :
And though it did not , yet the most of them
( Being either Courtiers , or not wholly rude )
Respect of Majesty , the Place , and Presence ,
Will keep then within Ring , especially
When they are not presented as themselves ,
But mask 'd like others : For ( in troth ) not so
T' incorporate them , could be nothing else ,
Than like a State ungover n 'd , without Laws ,
Or Body made of nothing but Diseases :
The one , through Impotency poor and wretched ;
The other , for the Anarchy absurd .
But , Lady , for the Revellers themselves ,
It would be better ( in my poor conceit )
That others were employ 'd ; for such as are
Unfit to be in Cynthia 's Court , can seem
No less unfit to be in Cynthia 's Sports .
That , Crites , is not purposed without
Particular knowledge of the Goddess Mind ,
( Who holding true Intelligence , what Follies
Had crept into her Palace ) she resolv 'd
Of Sports and Triumphs , under that pretext
To have them muster in their Pomp and Fulness ,
That so she might more strictly , and to root ,
Effect the Reformation she intends .
I now conceive her Heavenly drift in all ,
And will apply my Spirits to serve her Will .
O thou , the very Power by which I am ,
And but for which , it were in vain to be ,
Chief next Diana , Virgin , Heavenly fair ,
Admired Arete , ( of them admir 'd
Who Souls are not enkindled by the Sense )
Disdain not my chaste Fire , but feed the Flame
Devoted truly to thy gracious Name .
Leave to suspect us : Crites well shall find
As we are now most dear , we 'll prove most kind .
Heark , I am call 'd .
I follow instantly .
Ph?bus
Apollo , if with ancient Rites ,
And due Devotions , I have ever hung
Elaborate P?ans on thy golden Shrine ,
Or sung thy Triumphs in a lofty Strain ,
Fit for a Theatre of Gods to hear ;
And thou , the other Son of mighty Jove ,
Cyllenian Mercury ( sweet Maia 's Joy )
If in the busie Tumults of the Mind ,
My Path thou ever hast illumined ,
For which thine Altars I have oft perfum 'd ,
And deckt thy Statues with discolour 'd Flowers :
Now thrive Invention in this glorious Court ,
That not of Bounty only , but of Right ,
Cynthia may grace , and give it Life by sight .
QUeen , and Huntress , chaste and fair ,
Now the Sun is laid to sleep ,
Seated in thy Silver Chair ,
State in wonted manner keep :
Hesperus entreats thy Light ,
Goddess excellently bright .
Earth , let not thy envious Shade
Dare it self to interpose ;
Cynthia 's shining Orb was made
Heaven to clear , when Day did close :
Bless us then with wished Sight ,
Goddess excellently bright .
Lay thy Bow of Pearl apart ,
And thy Crystal shining Quiver ;
Give unto the flying Hart
Space to breath , how short soever :
Thou that mak 'st a Day of Night ,
Goddess excellently bright .
When hath Diana , like an envious Wretch ,
That glitters only to hjs soothed self ,
Denying to the World the precious Use
Of hoarded Wealth , with-held her friendly Aid ?
Monthly we spend our still-repaired Shrine ,
And not forbid our Virgin-waxen Torch
To burn and blaze , while Nutriment doth last :
That once consum 'd , out of Jove 's Treasury
A new we take , and stick it in our Sphere ,
To give the mutinous kind of wanting Men
Their lookt-for Light .
Yet what is their Desert ?
" Bounty is wrong 'd , interpreted as due ;
N " Mortals
" Mortals can challenge not a Ray , by right ,
" Yet do expect the whole of Cynthia 's Light .
But if that Deities withdrew their Gifts
For humane Follies , what could Men deserve
But Death and Darkness ?
It behoves the High ,
For their own sakes , to do things worthily .
Most true , most sacred Goddess ; for the Heavens
Receive no good of all the good they do :
Nor Jove , nor you , nor other Heavenly Powers ,
Are fed with Fumes which do from Incense rise ,
Or Sacrifices reeking in their Gore ;
Yet , for the Care which you of Mortals have ,
( Whose proper good it is that they be so )
You well are pleas 'd with Odours redolent :
But ignorant is all the Race of Men ,
Which still complains , not knowing why , or when .
Else , Noble Arete , they would not blame ,
And tax , or for unjust , or for as proud ,
Thy Cynthia , in the things which are indeed
The greatest Glories in our Starry Crown ;
Such is our Chastity , which safely scorns
( Not Love , for who more fervently doth love
Immortal Honour , and divine Renown ?
But ) giddy Cupid , Venus frantick Son .
Yet , Arete , if by this veiled Light
We but discover 'd ( what we not discern )
Any the least of Imputations stand
Ready to sprinkle our unspotted Fame
With note of Lightness , from these Revels near ;
Not , for the Empire of the Universe ,
Should Night , or Court , this whatsoever shine ,
Or Grace of ours unhappily enjoy .
" Place and Occasion are two privy Thieves ,
" And from poor innocent Ladies often steal
"( The best of things ) an honourable Name :
" To stay with Follies , or where Faults may be ,
" Infers a Crime , although the Party free .
How Cynthian-ly ( that is , how worthily
And like her self ) the matchless Cynthia speaks !
Infinite Jealousies , infinite Regards ,
Do watch about the true Virginity :
But Ph?be
lives from all , not only Fault ,
But as from Thought , so from Suspicion free .
" Thy Presence Broad-seals our Delights for pure ;
" What 's done in Cynthia 's sight , is done secure .
That then so answer 'd ( dearest Arete )
What th ' Argument , or of what sort our Sports
Are like to be this night , I not demand .
Nothing which Duty , and desire to please
Bears written in the Forehead , comes amiss .
But unto whose Invention must we owe
The Complement of this Nights Furniture ?
Excellent Goddess , to a Man 's , whose Worth
( Without Hyperbole ) I thus may praise ;
One ( at least ) studious of deserving well ,
And ( to speak truth ) indeed deserving well .
" Potential Merit stands for actual ,
" Where only Opportunity doth want ,
" Not Will , nor Power ; both which in him abound .
One whom the Muses and Minerva love .
For whom should they , than Crites , more esteem ,
Whom Ph?bus
( though not Fortune ) holdeth dear ?
And ( which convinceth Excellence in him )
A principal Admirer of your self .
Even though th ' ungentle Injuries of Fate ,
And Difficulties , which do Vertue choak ,
This much of him appears .
What other things
Of farther note do lie unborn in him ,
Them I do leave for cherishment to shew ,
And for a Goddess graciously to judge .
We have already judg 'd him , Arete ;
Nor are we ignorant , how noble Minds
Suffer too much through those Indignities
Which Times and vicious Persons cast on them .
Our self have ever vowed to esteem
( As Vertue for it self , so ) Fortune base ;
Who 's first in Worth , the same be first in Place .
Nor farther notice ( Arete ) we crave
Than thine Approvals , sovereign Warranty :
Let 's be thy Care to make us known to him ;
"Cynthia shall brighten what the World made dim .
CLear Pearl of Heaven , and , not to be farther am -
bitious in Titles , Cynthia : The Fame of this illu-
strious Night , among others , hath also drawn these four
fair Virgins from the Palace of their Queen Perfection ,
( a Word which makes no sufficient difference 'twixt
hers and thine ) to visit thy Imperial Court : For she ,
their Sovereign , not finding where to dwell among
Men , before her return to Heaven , advised them whol-
ly to consecrate themselves to thy Celestial Service , as
in whose clear Spirit ( the proper Element and Sphere
of Vertue ) they should behold not her alone , ( their
ever-honour 'd Mistriss ) but themselves ( more truly
themselves ) to live inthroniz 'd .
Her self would have
commended them unto thy Favour more particularly ,
but that she knows no Commendation is more available
with thee , than that of proper Vertue .
Nevertheless , she
will 'd them to present this Crystal Mound , a Note of
Monarchy , and Symbol of Perfection , to thy more
worthy Deity ; which , as here by me they most humbly
do , so amongst the Rarities thereof , that is the chief ,
to shew whatsoever the World hath excellent , howso -
ever remote and various .
But your irradiate Judgment
will soon discover the Secrets of this little Crystal
Themselves ( to appear more plainly ) because
they know nothing more odious than false Pretexts ,
have chosen to express their several Qualities thus in se-
veral Colours .
The first , in Citron Colour , is Natural Affection , which
given us to procure our Good , is sometime called Storge ;
and as every one is nearest to himself , so this Hand -
maid of Reason , allowable Self-love , as it is without
harm , so are none without it : Her Place in the Court
of Perfection was to quicken Minds in the pursuit of
Her Device is a Perpendicular Level , upon a
Cube or Square ; the Word , Se suo Modulo ; alluding
to that true Measure of ones self , which as every one
ought to make , so is it most conspicuous in thy divine
The second , in Green , is Aglaia , delectable and pleasant
Conversation , whose Property is to move a kindly Delight ,
and sometime not without Laughter : Her Office , to en-
tertain Assemblies , and keep Societies together with fair
Her Device , within a Ring of Clouds , a
Heart with Shine about it ; the Word , Curarum Nubila Pello :
An Allegory of Cynthia 's Light , which no less clears the
Sky than her fair Mirth the Heart .
The third , in the discolour 'd Mantle spangled all over ,
is Euphantaste , a well-conceited Wittiness , and employ 'd in
honouring the Court with the Riches of her pure Invent-
Her Device , upon a Petasus or Mercurial Hat , a Cres -
cent ; the Word , Sic Laus Ingenii ; inferring , that the praise
and glory of Wit doth ever increase , as doth thy growing
The fourth , in White , is Apheleia , a Nymph as pure and
simple as the Soul , or as an Abrase Table , and is therefore
called Simplicity ; without Folds , without Pleights , with -
out Colour , without Counterfeit ; and ( to speak plainly )
Plainness it self .
Her Device is no Device .
The Word under
her Silver Shield , Omnis abest Fucus ; alluding to thy spot-
less self , who art as far from Impurity as from Mortality .
My
My self ( Celestial Goddess ) more fit for the Court
of Cynthia than the Arbors of Cytheree , am call 'd Ante-
ros , or Loves Enemy ; the more welcome therefore to thy
Court , and the fitter to conduct this Quaternion , who as
they are thy professed Votaries , and for that cause ad-
versaries to Love , yet thee ( perpetual Virgin ) they both
love , and vow to love eternally .
Mine Eyes have view 'd ( in Contemplations depth )
This work of Wit , divine and excellent :
What shape , what substance , or what unknown power
In Virgins habit , crown 'd with Lawrel Leaves ,
And Olive Branches woven in between ,
On Sea-girt Rocks , like to a Goddess shines ?
O Front ! O Face ! O all C?lestial sure ,
And more than mortal ! Arete , behold
Another Cynthia , and another Queen ,
Whose glory ( like a lasting Plenilune )
Seems ignorant of what it is to wane .
Nor under Heaven an object could be found
More fit to please .
Let Crites make approach .
Bounty forbids to pall our thanks with stay ,
Or to defer our favour , after view :
" The time of grace is , when the cause is new .
Lo , here the Man ( Celestial Delia )
Who ( like a Circle bounded in it self )
Contains as much as Man in fulness may .
Lo , here the Man , who not of usual Earth ,
But of that nobler and more precious mould
Which Ph?bus
self doth temper , is compos 'd ;
And , who ( though all were wanting to reward )
Yet , to himself he would not wanting be :
Thy favours gain is his ambitions most ,
And labours best ; who ( humble in his height )
Stands fixed silent in thy glorious sight .
With no less pleasure , than we have beheld
This precious Crystal work of rarest wit ,
Our Eye doth read thee ( now enstil 'd ) our Crites ;
Whom learning , vertue , and our favour last ,
Exempteth from the gloomy multitude .
" With common Eye the Supreme should not see .
Hence-forth be Ours , the more thy self to be .
Heav'ns purest light , whose Orb may be eclips 'd ,
But not thy Praise ; ( divinest Cynthia )
How much too narrow for so high a grace ,
Thine ( save therein ) the most unworthy Crites
Doth find himself ! For ever shine thy fame ;
Thine honours ever , as thy beauties do ;
In me they must , my dark Worlds chiefest Lights ,
By whose propitious Beams my powers are rais 'd
To hope some part of those most lofty Points ,
Which blessed Arete hath pleas 'd to name ,
As marks , to which my 'ndeavours steps should bend :
Mine , as begun at thee , in thee must end .
SIster of Ph?bus ,
to whose bright Orb we owe , that
we not complain of his absence ; These four Brethren
( for they are Brethren , and Sons of Eutaxia , a Lady
known , and highly belov 'd of your resplendent Deity )
not able to be absent , when Cynthia held a Solemnity ,
officiously insinuate themselves into thy presence : For ,
as there are four Cardinal Vertues , upon which the
whole Frame of the Court doth move , so are these
the four Cardinal properties , without which , the body
of Complement moveth not .
With these four Silver
Javelins ( which they bear in their Hands ) they sup -
port in Princes Courts the state of the Presence , as by
office they are obliged ; which , though here they may
seem superfluous , yet for honours sake , they thus pre -
sume to visit thee , having also been employ 'd in the
Palace of Queen Perfection .
And though to them that
would make themselves gracious to a Goddess , Sacrifices
were fitter than Presents , or Impresses , yet they both
hope thy Favour , and ( in place of either ) use several Sym -
bols , containing the Titles of thy Imperial Dignity .
First , the hithermost , in the changeable blue and
green Robe , is the commendably-fashion 'd Gallant ,
Eucosmos ; whose Courtly Habit is the grace of the Pre -
sence , and delight of the surveying Eye : whom La -
dies understand by the names of Neat and Elegant .
His
Symbol is Div? Virgini , in which he would express thy
Deities principal Glory , which hath ever been Vir-
The Second , in the rich Accoutrement , and Robe of
Purple , empaled with Gold , is Eupathes ; who entertains
his mind with an harmless , but not incurious variety :
All the objects of his Senses are Sumptuous , himself a
Gallant , that , without excess , can make use of super-
fluity , go richly in Embroideries , Jewels , and what
not ?
without vanity , and fare delicately , without glut-
tony : and therefore ( not without cause ) is universally
thought to be of fine humour .
His Symbol is Div?
Optim? ; an Attribute to express thy Goodness , in which
thou so resemblest Jove thy Father .
The Third , in the blush-colour 'd Suit , is Eutolmos , as
duly respecting others , as never neglecting himself ; com-
monly known by the Title of good Audacity : to Courts ,
and courtly Assemblies , a Guest most acceptable .
His
Symbol is , Div? Viragini ; to express thy hardy cou-
rage , in chase of savage Beasts , which harbour in Woods
and Wildernesses .
The Fourth , in watchet Tinsel , is the kind and truly
benifique Eucolos ; who imparteth not without respect ,
but yet without difficulty ; and hath the happiness to
make every kindness seem double , by the timely and
freely bestowing thereof .
He is the chief of them , who
( by the vulgar ) are said to be of good nature .
His
Symbol is , Div? Maxim? ; an Adjunct to signifie
thy Greatness , which in Heaven , Earth , and Hell is for-
IS not that Amorphus , the traveller ?
As though it were not ! do you not see how
his Legs are in travel with a measure ?
Hedon , thy Master is next .
What , will Cupid turn Nomenclator , and cry
them ?
No faith , but I have a Com ?dy
toward , that
would not be lost for a Kingdom .
In good time , for Cupid will prove the Com ?dy .
Mercury , I am studying how to match them .
How to mis-match them were harder .
They are the Nymphs must do it ; I shall sport
my self with their Passions above measure .
Those Nymphs would be tam 'd a little , indeed ;
but I fear thou hast not Arrows for the purpose .
O , yes , here be of all sorts , Flights , Rovers , and
But I can wound with a Brandish , and never
draw Bow for the matter .
I cannot but believe it , my invisible Archer , and
yet methinks you are tedious .
N 2 Cup .
It
It behoves me to be somewhat circumspect , Mer-
cury ; for if Cynthia hear the twang of my Bow , she 'll
go neer to whip me with the string : therefore , to pre -
vent that , I thus discharge a brandish upon ?
it makes
no matter which of the couples .
Phantaste , and Amor-
phus , at you .
Will the shaking of a Shaft strike 'em into such
a Fever of Affection ?
As well as the winck of an Eye : but I pray thee ,
hinder me not with thy prattle .
Jove forbid I hinder thee .
Marry , all that I
fear , is Cynthia 's presence ; which , with the cold of her
Chastity , casteth such an Antiperistasis about the place ,
that no heat of thine will tarry with the Patient .
It will tarry the rather , for the Antiperistasis will
keep it in .
I long to see the experiment .
Why , their Marrow boils already , or they are all
turn 'd Eunuchs .
Nay , and't be so , I 'll give over speaking , and be
a spectator only .
Cynthia ( by my bright Soul ) is a right exqui-
site , and splendidious Lady ; yet Amorphus , I think , hath
seen more Fashions , I am sure more Countries : but whe-
ther I have , or not , whether need we gaze on Cynthia ,
that have our self to admire ?
O , excellent Cynthia ! yet if Phantaste sate where
she does , and had such Attire on her Head ( for At-
tire can do much ) I say no more ?
but Goddesses
are Goddesses , and Phantaste is as she is ! I would the
Revels were done once , I might go to my School of
Glass again , and learn to do my self right after all this
How now , Cupid ?
here 's a wonderful change
with your brandish ! do you not hear how they dote ?
What Prodigie is this ?
no word of Love ?
no
mention ?
no motion ?
Not a word , my little Ignis fatue , not a word .
Are my Darts inchanted ?
Is their vigour gone ?
is their Vertue ?
What ?
Cupid turn 'd jealous of himself ?
ha , ha , ha .
Laughs Mercury ?
Is Cupid angry ?
Hath he not cause , when his purpose is so de-
luded ?
A rare Com ?die ,
it shall be intituled , Cupids .
Do not scorn us , Hermes .
Choler , and Cupid , are two fiery things ; I scorn
'em not .
But I see that come to pass , which I presag 'd
in the beginning .
You cannot tell : perhaps the Physick will not
work so soon upon some , as upon others .
It may be ,
the rest are not so resty .
Ex ungue ; you know the old adage , as these , so
are the remainder .
I 'll try : this is the same Shaft with which I
wounded Argurion .
I , but let me save you a labour , Cupid : there
were certain Bottles of Water fetcht , and drunk off
( since that time ) by these Gallants .
Jove , strike me into Earth : the Fountain of self -
Love !
Nay , faint not , Cupid .
I remembred it not .
Faith , it was ominous to take the name of An-
teros upon you , you know not what Charm or Inchant-
ment lies in the word : you saw , I durst not venture up -
on any device , in our presentment , but was content
to be no other than a simple Page .
Your Arrows pro-
perties ( to keep decorum ) Cupid , are suted ( it should
seem ) to the nature of him you personate .
Indignity not to be born .
Nay rather , an attempt to have been forborn .
How might I revenge my self on this insulting
Mercury ?
there 's Crites , his minion , he has not tasted of
this Water .
It shall be so .
Is Crites turn 'd dotard on
himself too ?
That follows not , because the Venome of your
Shafts cannot pierce him , Cupid .
As though there were one Antidote for these ;
and another for him .
As though there were not ; or as if one effect
might not arise of divers causes ?
What say you to
Cynthia , Arete , Phronesis , Time , and others there ?
They are Divine .
And Crites aspires to be so .
But that shall not serve him .
' Tis like to do it , at this time .
But Cupid is
grown too covetous , that will not spare one of a mul-
One is more than a multitude .
Aretes favour makes any one Shot-proof against
thee , Cupid .
I pray thee , light Hony-bee , remember
thou art not now in Adonis Garden , but in Cynthia 's pre -
sence , where Thorns lie in Garrison about the Roses .
Soft Cynthia speaks .
And give a timely period to our Sports ,
Let us conclude them with declining Night ;
Our Empire is but of the darker half .
And if you judge it any recompence
For your fair pains , t 'have earn 'd Diana 's thanks ;
Diana grants them : and bestows their Crown
To gratifie your acceptable Zeal .
For you are they , that not ( as some have done )
Do censure us , as too severe and sowre ,
But as ( more rightly ) gracious to the good ;
Although we not deny , unto the proud ,
Or the prophane , perhaps indeed austere :
Than he presum 'd ) was troph?ed into Stone .
But are we therefore judged too extreme ?
Seems it no crime , to enter sacred Bowers ,
And hallowed Places , with impure aspect ,
Most lewdly to pollute ?
Seems it no crime ,
To brave a Deity ?
Let Mortals learn
To make Religion of offending Heaven ;
And not at all to censure Powers Divine .
To Men , this argument should stand for firm ,
' A Goddess did it , therefore it was good :
' We are not cruel , nor delight in Blood .
But what have serious repetitions
To do with Revels , and the Sports of Court ?
We not intend to sowre your late delights
With harsh expostulation .
Let 's suffice ,
That we take notice , and can take revenge
Of these calumnious , and lewd Blasphemies .
For we are no less Cynthia , than we were ,
Nor is our Power ( but as our self ) the same :
Though we have now put on no tire of shine ,
But mortal Eyes undaz'led may endure .
' Years are beneath the Spheres : and time makes weak
' Things under Heaven , not Powers which govern Heaven .
And though our self be , in our self secure ,
Yet let not Mortals challenge to themselves
Immunity from thence .
Lo , this is all :
' Honour hath store of Spleen , but wanteth Gall .
Once more , we cast the slumber of our thanks
On your ta'n toil , which here let take an end .
And that we not mistake your several worths ,
Nor you our favour , from your selves remove
What
What makes you not your selves , those Clouds of Mask :
" Particular Pains , particular Thanks do ask .
How ! let me view you .
Ha ! are we contemn 'd ?
Is there so little awe of our Disdain ,
That any ( under trust of their Disguise )
Should mix themselves with others of the Court ,
And ( without Forehead ) boldly press so far ,
As farther none ?
How apt is Lenity
To be abus 'd ?
Severity to be loath 'd ?
And yet , how much more doth the seeming Face
Of Neighbour-Vertues , and their borrowed Names ,
Add of lewd Boldness to loose Vanities ?
Who would have thought that Philautia durst
Or have usurped Noble Storges Name ,
Or with that Theft have ventur 'd on our Eyes ?
Who would have thought , that all of them should hope
So much of our Continence , as to come
To grace themselves with Titles not their own ?
In stead of Med'cins , have we Maladies ?
And such Imposthumes as Phantaste is ,
Grow in our Palace ?
We must lance these Sores ,
Or all will putrifie .
Nor are these all ,
For we suspect a farther Fraud than this :
Take off our Vail , that Shadows may depart ,
And Shapes appear : Beloved Arete ! ? ?
So ,
Another Face of Things presents it self ,
Than did of late .
What ! feather 'd Cupid mask 'd ,
And mask 'd like Anteros ?
And stay ! more strange !
Dear Mercury , our Brother , like a Page ,
To countenance the Ambush of the Boy ?
Nor endeth our Discovery as yet :
Gelaia , like a Nymph , that but e 're-while
( In male Attire ) did serve Anaides ?
Cupid came hither to find Sport and Game ,
Who heretofore hath been to conversant
Among our Train , but never felt Revenge ;
And Mercury bare Cupid company .
Cupid , we must confess , this time of Mirth
( Proclaim 'd by us ) gave opportunity
To thy Attempts , although no Privilege ;
Tempt us no farther ; we cannot endure
Thy Presence longer ; vanish hence , away .
You , Mercury , we must entreat to stay ,
And hear what we determine of the rest ;
For in this Plot we well perceive your Hand .
But ( for we mean not a Censorian Task ,
And yet to lance these Ulcers grown so ripe )
Dear Arete , and Crites , to you two
We give the Charge ; impose what Pains you please :
Th' incurable cut off , the rest reform ,
Remembring ever what we first decreed ,
Since Revels were proclaim 'd , let now none bleed .
How well Diana can distinguish Times ,
And sort her Censures , keeping to her self
The Doom of Gods , leaving the rest to us ?
Come , cite them , Crites , first , and then proceed .
First , Philautia , ( for she was the first )
Then light Gelaia , in Aglaias Name ;
Thirdly , Phantaste , and Moria next ,
Main Follies all , and of the Female Crew :
Amorphus , or Eucosmos Counterfeit ,
Voluptuous Hedon , ta'ne for Eupathes ,
Brazen Anaides , and Asotus last ,
With his two Pages , Morus and Prosaites ;
And thou , the Traveller 's Evil , Cos, approach ,
Impostors all , and Male Deformities ? ?
Nay , forward , for I delegate my Power ,
And will that at thy Mercy they do stand ,
Whom they so oft , so plainly scorn 'd before .
"'Tis Vertue which they want , and wanting it ,
" Honour no Garment to their Backs can fit .
Then , Crites , practise thy Discretion .
Adored Cynthia , and bright Arete ,
Another might seem fitter for this Task ,
Than Crites far , but that you judge not so :
For I ( not to appear vindicative ,
Or mindful of Contempts , which I contemn 'd ,
As done of impotence ) must be remiss ;
Who , as I was the Author , in some sort ,
To work their Knowledge into Cynthia 's sight ,
So should be much severer to revenge
Th' Indignity hence issuing to her Name :
But there 's not one of these who are unpain 'd ,
Or by themselves unpunished ; for Vice
Is like a Fury to the vicious Mind ,
And turns Delight it self to Punishment .
But we must forward , to design their Doom .
You are Offenders , that must be confest ;
Do you confess it ?
We do .
And that you merit sharp Correction ?
Then we ( reserving unto Delia 's Grace
Her farther Pleasure , and to Arete
What Delia granteth ) thus do sentence you .
That from this Place ( for Penance known of all ,
Since you have drunk so deeply of self-love )
You ( two and two ) singing a Palinode ,
March to your several Homes by Niobe 's Stone ,
And offer up two Tears apiece thereon ,
That it may change the Name , as you must change ,
And of a Stone be called Weeping-Cross ,
Because it standeth cross of Cynthia 's way ,
One of whose Names is Sacred Trivia .
And , after Penance thus perform 'd , you pass
In like set Order , not as Midas did ,
To wash his Gold off into Tagus Stream ;
But to the Well of Knowledge , Helicon ;
Where purged of your present Maladies ,
( Which are not few , nor slender ) you become
Such as you fain would seem , and then return ,
Offering your Service to great Cynthia .
This is your Sentence , if the Goddess please
To ratifie it with her high Consent .
" The scope of wise Mirth unto Fruit is bent .
We do approve thy Censure , belov 'd Crites ;
Which Mercury , thy true propitious Friend ,
( A Deity next Jove belov 'd of us )
Will undertake to see exactly done .
And for this Service of Discovery ,
Perform 'd by thee , in honour of our Name ,
We vow to guerdon it with such due Grace
As shall become our Bounty , and thy Place .
" Princes that would their People should do well ,
" Must at themselves begin , as at the Head ;
" For Men , by their Example , pattern out
" Their Imitations , and regard of Laws :
" A vertuous Court a World to Vertue draws .
