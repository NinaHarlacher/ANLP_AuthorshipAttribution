he walks in his Gown , Wastcoat , and Trousers , expect-
ing his Taylor .
GRamercy Letherleg : Get me the Spurrier ,
And thou hast fitted me .
I 'll do 't presently .
Look to me , Wit , and look to my VVit ,
Land ,
That is , look on me , and with all thine Eyes ,
Male , Female , yea , Hermaphroditick Eyes ,
And those bring all your helps and Perspicills ,
To see me at best advantage , and augment
My Form as I come forth , for I do feel
I will be one , worth looking after , shortly .
Now , by and by , that 's shortly .
't strikes ! One , Two ,
Three , Four , Five , Six .
Enough , enough , dear VVatch ,
Thy Pulse hath beat enough .
Now sleep and rest ;
VVould thou couldst make the Time to do so too :
I 'll wind the up no more .
The hour is come
So long expected ! There , there , drop my VVardship ,
My Pupillage and Vassalage together .
And Liberty , come throw thy self about me ,
In a rich Sute , Cloak , Hat , and Band , for now
I 'll sue out no Mans Livery , but mine own ,
I stand on my own Feet , so much a year ,
Right , round , and sound , the Lord of mine own Ground ,
And ( to Rime to it ) Threescore thousand Pound !
Not come ?
Not yet ?
Taylor , thou art a Vermine ,
VVorse than the same thou prosecut 'st , and prick 'st
In subtil Seam ?
( Go too , I say no more )
Thus to retard my Longings : on the day
I do write Man , to beat thee .
One and twenty
Since the Clock struck , compleat ! and thou wilt feel it ,
Thou foolish Animall ! I could pitty him ,
( An' I were not heartily angry with him now )
For this one piece of Folly he bears about him ,
To dare to tempt the Fury of an Heir
T' above Two thousand a year ; yet hope his Custom !
VVell , Master Fashioner , there 's some must break ?
A Head , for this your breaking .
Are you come , Sir ?
What ?
of your staying ?
And leaving me to stalk here in my Trowses ,
Like a tame Her 'n-sew for you ?
I but waited
Below , till the Clock strooke .
Why , if you had come
Before a quarter , would it so have hurt you ,
In Reputation , to have waited her ?
No, but your Worship might have pleaded Nonage ,
If you had got 'em on , ere I could make
Just Affidavit of the Time .
That Jest
Has gain 'd thy Pardon , thou had 'st liv 'd condemn 'd
To thine own Hell else , never to have wrought
Stitch more for me , or any Peniboy ,
I could have hindred thee : but now thou art mine ,
For One and twenty Years , or for three Lives ,
Chuse which thou wilt , I 'll make thee a Copy-holder ,
And thy first Bill unquestion 'd .
Help me on .
Presently , Sir : I am bound unto your Worship .
Thou shalt be , when I have seal 'd thee a Lease
of my Custom .
Your Worships Barber is without .
Who ?
Thom ?
Come in Thom : set thy things upon the Board ,
And spread thy Clothes , lay all forth in procinctu ,
And tell 's what news ?
O Sir , a Staple of News !
Or the New Staple , which you please .
What 's that ?
An Office , Sir , a brave young Office set up .
I had forgot to tell your Worship .
For what ?
To enter all the News , Sir , o ' the time .
And vent it as occasion serves ! A Place
Of huge commerce it will be ! P.
Pray thee peace ,
I cannot abide a talking Taylor : Let Thom
( He 's a Barber ) by his Place relate it .
What is't , an Office , Thom ?
Newly erected
Here in the House , almost on the same Floor ,
Where all the News of all sorts shall be brought ,
And there be Examin 'd , and then Registred ,
And so to be issu 'd under the Seal of the Office ,
As Staple News ; no other News be currant .
' Fore me , thou speak 'st of , a brave business , Thom .
Nay , if you knew the Brain that hatch 'd it , Sir ?
I know thee well enough : give him a Loaf , Thom ?
Quiet his Mouth , that Oven will be venting else .
Proceed ?
He tells you true , Sir , Master Cymbal
Is Master of the Office , he projected it ,
He lies here i' the House : and the great Rooms
He
He has taken for the Office , and set up
His Desks and Classes , Tables and his Shelves ,
He 's my Customer , and a Wit , Sir , too .
But , h ' has brave Wits under him ? ?
Yes , four Emissaries ,
Emissaries ?
stay , there 's a fine new word , Thom !
'Pray God it signifie any thing , what are Emissaries ?
Men imploy 'd outward , that are sent abroad
To fetch in the Commodity .
From all Regions
Where the best News are made .
Or vented forth .
By way of exchange , or trade .
Nay , thou wilt speak ?
My share , Sir , there 's enough for both .
Go on then ,
Speak all thou canst : methinks the Ordinaries ,
Should help them much .
Sir , they have Ordinaries ,
And Extraordinaries , as many Changes
And Variations , as there are Points i' the Compass .
But the 4 Cardinal Quarters ?
I those Thom ?
The Court , Sir , Pauls , Exchange , and Westminster-hall .
Who is the Chief ?
which hath Precedency ?
The Governour o ' the Staple , Master Cymball .
He is the Chief ; and after him the Emissaries :
First Emissary Court , one Master Fitton ,
He 's a Jeerer too .
What 's that ?
A Wit .
Or half a Wit .
some of them are Half-wits ,
Two to a Wit , there are a set of 'em .
Then Master Ambler , Emissary Pauls ,
A fine pac 'd Gentleman , as you shall see , walk
The middle Isle : And then my Froy Hans Buz ,
A Dutch-man ; he 's Emissary Exchange .
I had thought Mr. Burst the Merchant had had it .
No,
He has a Rupture , he has sprung a Leak ,
Emissary Westminster 's undispos 'd of yet ;
Then the Examiner , Register , and two Clerks ,
They mannage all at home , and sort , and file ,
And seal the News , and issue them .
dear Thom .
What may my means do for thee , ask and have it ,
I 'd fain be doing some good .
It is my Birth-day .
And I 'd do it betimes , I feel a grudging
Of Bounty , and I would not long lye fallow .
I pray thee think and speak , or wish for somethi ng .
I would I had but one o ' the Clerks Places
I ' this News-Office .
Thou shalt have it Thom ,
If Silver or Gold will fetch it ; what 's the Rate ?
At what is't set i' the Mercat ?
Fifty Pound , Sir .
An't were a hundred , Thom , thou shalt not want it .
O Noble Master ! P.
How now ?sops Ass !
Because I play with Thom , must I needs run
Into your rude Embraces ?
stand you still , Sir ;
Clowns fawnings are a Horses salutations .
How do 'st thou like my suit , Thom ?
Mr. Fashioner
Has hit your Measures , Sir , h ' has moulded you ,
And made you , as they say .
No, no , not I ,
I am an Ass , old ?sops Ass .
Nay , Fashioner ,
I can do thee a good turn too , be not musty ,
Though thou hast moulded me , as little Thom says ,
( I think thou hast put me in mouldy Pockets . )
As good ,
Right Spanish Perfume , the Lady Estifania 's ,
They cost Twelve pound a Pair .
Thy Bill will say so .
I pray thee tell me , Fashioner , what Authors
Thou read 'st to help thy Invention ?
Italian Prints ?
Or Arras Hangings ?
They are Taylors Libraries .
I scorn such helps .
O , though thou art a Silk-worm !
And deal 'st in Sattins and Velvets , and rich Plushes ,
Thou canst not spin all Forms out of thy self ;
They are quite other things : I think this suit
Has made me wittier then I was .
Believe it , Sir ,
That Clothes do much upon the Wit , as Weather
Do 's on the Brain ; and thence comes your Proverb ;
The Taylor makes the Man : I speak by experience
Of my own Customers .
I have had Gallants ,
Both Court and Countrey , would ha' fool 'd you up
In a new Suit , with the best Wits in being ,
And kept their speed as long as their Clothes lasted
Handsome and neat ; but then as they grew out
At the Elbows again , or had a stain or spot ,
They have sunk most wretchedly .
What thou report 'st ,
Is but the common Calamity , and seen daily ;
And therefore you 'ave another answering Proverb :
A broken Sleeve keeps the Arm back .
' Tis true , Sir .
And thence we say , that such a one plays at Peep-arm .
Do you so ?
it is wittily said .
I wonder , Gentlemen ,
And Men of Means will not maintain themselves
Fresher in wit , I mean in Clothes , to the highest .
For he that 's out o ' Clothes , is out o ' Fashion ,
And out of Fashion , is out of Countenance ,
And out o ' Countenance is out o ' Wit .
Is not Rogue Haberdasher come ?
Yes , here , Sir .
I ha' been without this half hour .
Give me my Hat .
Put on my Girdle Rascal , sits my Ruff well ?
In print .
See your self .
Is this same Hat
O' the Block Passant ?
Do not not answer me ,
I cannot stay for an answer .
I do feel
The Powers of One and twenty , like a Tide
Flow in upon me , and perceive an Heir ,
Can Conjure up all Spirits in all Circles ,
Rogue , Rascal , Slave , give Tradesmen their true names ,
And they appear to 'em presently .
For Profit .
Come , cast my Cloak about me , I 'll go see ,
This Office Thom , and be trimm 'd afterwards .
I 'll put thee in possession , my prime work !
Gods so : my Spurrier ! put 'em on Boy , quickly ,
I ' had like to ha' lost my Spurs with too much speed .
The Lord , and the Prince of Plenty !
I come to see what Riches , Thou bearest in thy Breeches ,
The first of thy One and Twenty :
What , do thy Pockets gingle ?
Or shall we need to mingle
Our strength both of Foot and Horses !
These Fellows look so eager , As if they would beleaguer
And Heir in the midst of his Forces !
I hope they be no Serjeants ! That hang upon thy Margents .
This Rogue has the Joul of a Jaylor !
O Founder , no such matter , My Spurrier , and my Hatter ,
My Linnen-man , and my Taylor .
Thou should 'st have been brought in too , Shoomaker ,
If the time had been longer , and Thom Barber .
How do 'st thou like my Company , old Canter ?
Do I not muster a brave Troop ?
all Bill-men ?
Present your Arms before my Founder here ,
This is my Founder , this same learned Canter !
He brought me the first news of my Fathers death ,
I thank him , and ever since , I call him Founder ,
Worship him , Boys , I 'll read only the Sums ,
And pass 'em streight .
Now Ale .
And strong Ale bless him .
Gods so , some Ale , and Sugar for my Founder !
Good Bills , sufficient Bills , these Bills may pass .
I do not like those Paper-squibs , good Master .
They may undo your store , I mean , of Credit ,
And fire your Arsenall , if case you do not
K k k In
In time make good those Outer-works , your Pockets ,
And take a Garrison in of some two hundred ,
To beat these Pioneers off , that carry a Mine
Would blow you up , at last .
Secure your Casamates ,
Here Master Picklock , Sir , your Man o ' Law ,
And learn 'd Atturny , has sent you a Bag of Munition .
What is't ?
Three hundred Pieces .
I 'll dispatch 'em
Do , I would have your strengths lin 'd , and perfum 'd
With Gold as well as Amber .
God a mercy ,
Come , Ad solvendum , Boys ! there , there , and there , &c .
I look on nothing but Totalis .
See !
The difference 'twixt the Covetous and the Prodigal !
" The Covetous Man never has Money ! and
" The Prodigal will have none shortly ! P.
Ha ,
What says my Founder ?
I thank you , I thank you Sirs .
God bless your Worship , and your Worships Chanter .
I say 'tis nobly done , to cherish Shopkeepers ,
And pay their Bills , without examining thus .
Alas ! they have had a pittiful hard time on't ,
A long vacation , from their cozening .
Poor Rascalls , I do do it out of Charity .
I would advance their Trade again , and have them
Haste to be Rich , swear and forswear wealthily ,
What do you stay for , Sirrah ?
To my Box Sir .
Your Box , why , there 's an Angel , if my Spurs
Be not right Rippon .
Give me never a Penny
If I strike not thorow your Bounty with the Rowels .
Do 'st thou want any Money Founder ?
Who , Sir , I ,
Did I not tell you I was bred i' the Mines ,
Under Sir Bevis Bullion .
That is true ,
I quite forgot , you Mine-men want no Money ,
Your Streets are pav 'd with't : there , the Molten Silver
Runs out like Cream on Cakes of Gold .
And Rubies
Do grow like Strawberries .
' Twere brave being there !
Come Thom , we 'll go to the Office now .
What Office ?
News Office , the New Staple ; thou shalt go too ,
' Tis here i' the House , on the same Floor , Thom .
Come Founder , let us trade in Ale and Nutmegs .
set forth the Table
The Carpet and the Chair : where are the News
That were examin 'd last ?
ha' you fil 'd them up ?
Not yet , I had no time .
Are those news Registred ,
That Emissary Buz sent in last night ?
Of Spinola and his Eggs ?
Yes Sir , and fil 'd .
What are you now upon ?
That our new Emissary
Westminster , gave us , of the Golden Hair .
Dispatch , that 's News indeed , and of importance .
What would you have good Woman ?
I would have Sir ,
A Groatsworth of any News , I care not what ,
To carry down this Saturday , to our Vicar .
O ! You are a Butterwoman , ask Nathaniel
The Clerk there .
Sir , I tell her , she must stay
Till Emissary Exchange , or Pauls send in ,
And then I 'll fit her .
Do good Woman , have patience ,
It is not now , as when the Captain liv 'd .
You 'll blast the Reputation of the Office ,
Now i' the Bud , if you dispatch these Groats ,
So soon : let them attend in name of Policy .
This is the outer Room , where my Clerks sit ,
And keep their sides , the Register i' the midst ,
The Examiner , he sits private there , within ,
And here I have my several Rowls and Fyles
Of News by the Alphabet , and all put up
Under their Heads .
But those too subdivided ?
Into Authenticall , and Apocryphall .
Or News of doubtful credit , as Barbers News .
And Taylors News , Porters , and Watermens news ,
Whereto , beside the Coranti , and Gazetti .
I have the News of the season .
As Vacation-news ,
Term-news , and Christmas-news .
And News o ' the Faction .
As the Reformed-news .
Protestant-news ,
And Pontificial-news , of all which several ,
The Day-books , Characters , Precedents are kept .
Together with the Names of special Friends ? ?
And Men of Correspondence i' the Countrey ?
Yes , of all Ranks , and all Religions . ? ?
Factors and Agents ? ?
Cym , Liegers , that lye out
Through all the Shires o ' the Kingdom .
This is fine !
And bears a brave relation ! but what says
Mercurius Britannicus to this ?
O Sir , he gains by 't half in half .
Nay more
I 'll stand to't .
For , where he was wont to get
In , hungry Captains , obscure Statesman .
Fellows
To drink with him in a dark Room in a Tavern ,
And eat a Sawsage .
We ha' see n't , Cym .
As fain ,
To keep so many Politick Pens .
Going to feed the Press .
And dish out News ,
Were 't true , or false .
Now all that charge is sav 'd
The publick Chronicler .
How do you call him there ?
And gentle Reader .
He that has the Maidenhead
Of all the Books .
Yes , dedicated to him ,
Or rather prostituted .
You are right , Sir .
No more shall be abus 'd , nor Countrey-Parsons
O' the Inquisition , nor busie Justices ,
Trouble the peace , and both torment themselves ,
And their poor ign'rant Neighbours with inquiries
After the many and most innocent Monsters ,
That never came i' th ' Counties the were charg 'd with .
Why , methinks , Sir , if the honest common People
Will be abus 'd , why should not they ha' their pleasure ,
In the believing Lyes , are made for them ;
As you i' th ' Office , making them your selves ?
O Sir ! it is the printing we oppose .
VVe not forbid that any News be made ,
But that 't be printed ; for when News is printed ,
It leaves , Sir , to be News , while 'tis but written ? ?
Though it be ne 're so false , it runs News still .
See divers Mens Opinions ! unto some ,
The very printing of them makes them News ;
That ha' not the Heart to believe any thing ,
But what they see in print .
I , that 's an Error
Has abus 'd many ; but we shall reform it ,
As many things beside ( we have a hope )
Are crept among the popular abuses .
Nor shall the Stationer cheat upon the Time ,
By buttering over again ? ?
Once in Seven Years ,
As the Age doats ?
And grows forgetful o ' them .
His antiquated Pamphlets , with new Dates .
But all shall come from the Mint .
Fresh and new stamp 'd ,
VVith the Office-Seal , Staple-Commodity .
And if a Man will assure his News , he may :
Two-pence
Two pence a Sheet he shall be warranted ,
And have a Policy for't .
Sir , I admire
The Method o ' your Place ; all things within't
Are so digested , fitted , and compos 'd ,
As it shews Wit had married Order .
The best we could to invite the Times .
It has
Cost Sweat and Freezing .
And some broken Sleeps ,
Before it came to this .
I easily think it .
But now it has the shape ?
And is come forth .
A most polite neat thing , with all the Limbs ,
As Sense can taste ! Cym .
It is , Sir , though I say it ,
As well-begotten a Business , and as fairly
Helpt to the VVorld .
You must be a Midwife , Sir ,
Or else the Son of a Midwife , ( pray you pardon me )
Have helpt it forth so happily ! VVhat News ha' you ?
News o ' this morning ?
I would fain hear some
Fresh from the Forge , ( as new as Day , as they say . )
And such we have , Sir .
Shew him the last Roll ,
Of Emissary Westminster 's , the Heir .
Come nearer , Thom .
There is a brave young Heir
Is come of age this morning , Mr. Peni-boy .
That 's I !
His Father died on this day seven-night .
True !
At six o ' the Clock i' the morning , just a VVeek
Ere he was One and twenty .
of it .
I am here , Thom !
Proceed , I pray thee .
An old Canting Beggar
Brought him first News , whom he has entertain 'd
To follow him since .
VVhy , you shall see him ! Founder ,
Come in ; no Follower , but Companion :
I pray thee put him in , Friend ; there 's an Angel ?
Thou dost not know , he 's a wise old Fellow ,
Though he seem patch 'd thus , and made up o ' Pieces .
Founder , we are in here , in , i' the News-Office !
In this days Roll , already ! I do muse
How you came by us , Sirs ! Cym .
One Master Pick-lock ,
A Lawyer , that hath purchas 'd here a Place
This morning , of an Emissary under me .
Emissary Westminster .
Gave it into th ' Office
For his Essay , his Piece .
My Man o ' Law
He 's my Attorney , and Sollicitor too !
A fine Pragmatick ! what 's his Place worth ?
A Nemo-scit , Sir . Fit .
' Tis as News come in .
And as they are issued .
I have the just moiety
For my part ?
then the other moiety
Is parted into seven : The four Emissaries ,
Whereof my Cousin Fitton here 's for Court ,
Ambler for Pauls , and Buz for the Exchange ,
Picklock for Westminster , with the Examiner ,
And Register , they have full Parts : and then one Part
Is under-parted to a couple of Clerks ;
And there 's the just Division of the Profits .
Ha' you those Clerks , Sir ?
There is one Desk empty ,
But it has many Suitors .
Sir , may I
Present one more , and carry it , if his Parts
Or Gifts , ( which you will call 'em . )
Be sufficient , Sir .
What are your present Clerk 's Habilities ?
How is he qualified ?
A decay 'd Stationer
He was , but knows News well , can sort and rank 'em .
And for a need can make 'em .
True Pauls bred ,
I ' the Church yard .
And this at the West-door ,
O' th ' other side ; he 's my Barber , Thom ,
A pretty Scholar , and a Master of Arts ,
Was made , or went out Master of Arts in a throng ,
At the University ; as before , one Christmas ,
He got into a Mask at Court , by his Wit ,
And the good means of his Cythern , holding up thus
For one o ' the Musick : He 's a nimble Fellow ,
And alike skill 'd in every Liberal Science ,
As having certain Snaps of all ; a neat
Quick Vein in forging News too : I do love him ,
And promis 'd him a good turn , and I would do it .
What 's your Price ?
the Value ?
Fifty pounds , Sir .
Get in , Thom , take possession , I install thee .
Here , tell your Money : Give thee joy , good Thom ;
And let me hear from thee ever minute of News ,
While the New Staple stands , or the Office lasts ,
Which I do wish may ne 'er be less , for thy sake .
The Emissaries , Sir , would speak with you ,
And Master Fitton ; they have brought in News ,
Three Bale together .
Sir , you are welcome here .
So is your Creature .
Business calls us off , Sir ,
That may concern the Office .
Keep me fair , Sir ,
Still i' your Staple ; I am here your Friend ,
On the same Floor .
We shall be your Servants .
How dost thou like it , Founder ?
All is well ,
But that your Man o ' Law , me thinks , appears not
In his due time .
O ! Here comes Masters Worship .
Is he awake yet in his One and twenty ?
Why , this is better far , than to wear Cypress ,
Dull smutting Gloves , or melancholy Blacks ,
And have a pair of Twelvepenny-broad Ribbands
Laid out like Labels .
I should ha' made shift
To have laught as heartily in my Mourners Hood ,
As in this Suit , if it had pleas 'd my Father
To have been buried with the Trumpeters .
The Heralds of Arms , you mean .
I mean ,
All noise that is superfluous ! Pic .
All that idle Pomp ,
And Vanity of a Tomb-stone , your wise Father
Did by his Will prevent .
Your Worship had ?
A loving and obedient Father of him ,
I know it ; a right kind-natur 'd Man ,
To die so opportunely .
And to settle
All things so well , compounded for your Wardship
The Week afore , and left your State entire ,
Without any charge upon't .
I must needs say ,
I lost an Officer of him , a good Bailiff ,
And I shall want him : but all peace be with him ,
I will not wish him alive again , not I ,
For all my Fortune .
Give your Worship joy
O' your new Place , your Emissaryship
I ' the News Office .
Know you why I bought it , Sir ?
Not I.
To work for you , and carry a Mine
Against the Master of it , Master Cymbal ,
Who hath a Plot upon a Gentlewoman
Was once design 'd for you , Sir .
Me ?
Your Father ,
Old Master Peni-boy , of happy Memory ,
And Wisdom too , as any i' the County ,
Careful to find out a fit Match for you ,
In his own Life-time , ( but he was prevented )
Left it in Writing in a Schedule here ,
To be annexed to his Will , That you ,
His only Son , upon his Charge and Blessing ,
Should take due notice of a Gentlewoman
Sojourning with your Uncle , Richer Peni-boy .
A Cornish Gentlewoman , I do know her ,
Mistris Pecunia Do-all .
A great Lady ,
Indeed she is , and not of Mortal Race ,
Infanta of the Mines ; her Graces Grandfather
Was Duke , and Cousin to the King of Ophyr ,
The Subterranean .
Let that pass .
Her name is ,
K k k 2 Or
Or rather , her three Names are ( for such she is )
Aurelia Clara Pecunia , a great Princess ,
Of mighty Power , though she live in private ,
With a contracted Family ! Her Secretary ?
Who is her Gentleman Usher too .
One Broker ,
And then two Gentlewomen , Mistris Statute ,
And Mistris Band , with Wax the Chambermaid ,
And Mother Mortgage the old Nurse , two Grooms ,
Pawn and his Fellow : You have not many to bribe , Sir .
The work is feizible , and th ' Approaches easie ,
By your own Kindred .
Now , Sir , Cymbal thinks ,
The Master here , and Governor o ' the Staple ,
By his fine Arts , and Pomp of his great Place ,
To draw her ! He concludes , she is a Woman !
And that so soon as sh ' hears of the New Office ,
She 'll come to visit it , as they all have Longings
After new Sights and Motions ! But your Bounty ,
Person , and Bravery , must atchieve her .
She is
The Talk o ' the Time ! th ' adventure o ' the Age !
All sorts of Men , and all Professions !
You shall have Stall-fed Doctors , cramm 'd Divines ,
Make Love to her , and with those studied
And perfum 'd Flatteries , as no Room can stink
More elegant , than where they are .
Well chanted ,
Old Canter , thou sing 'st true .
And ( by your leave )
Good Masters Worship , some of your Velvet Coat
Make corpulent Curt 'sies to her , till they crack for't .
There 's Doctor Almanac woos her , one of the Jeerers ,
A fine Physician .
Your Sea-Captain , Shunfield ,
Gives out , he 'll go upon the Cannon for her .
Though his loud Mouthing get him little Credit .
Young Master Pied-mantle , the fine Herald ,
Professes to derive her through all Ages ,
From all the Kings and Queens that ever were .
And Master Madrigal , the crowned Poet
Of these our Times , doth offer at her Praises
As fair as any , when it shall please Apollo
That Wit and Rime may meet both in one Subject .
And you to bear her from all these , it will be ?
A work of Fame .
Of Honour .
Worthy your Name .
The Peni-boys to live in't .
And carry it .
Fear me not ; for since I came
Of mature age , I have had a certain itch
In my right eye , this corner here , do you see ?
To do some work , and worthy of a Chronicle .
Very scurvily , me thinks , and sufficiently
As a Body would wish : Here 's nothing but
a young Prodigal , come of age , who makes much of the Bar-
ber , buys him a Place in a New Office , i' the Air , I know
not where , and his Man o ' Law to follow him , with the
Beggar to Boot , and they two help him to a Wife .
I , she is a proper Piece ! that such Creatures can
broke for .
I cannot abide that nasty Fellow , the Beggar ; if
he had been a Court-Beggar , in good Clothes , a Beggar in
Velvet , as they say , I could have endur 'd him .
Or a Begging Scholar in Black , or one of these
beggarly Poets , Gossip , that would hang upon a young Heir
like a Horseleech .
Or a thred-bare Doctor of Physick , a poor
Or a Sea-Captain half starv 'd .
I , these were tolerable Beggars , Beggars of fashi-
on ! You shall see some such anon .
I would fain see the Fool , Gossip ; the Fool is
the finest Man i' the Company , they say , and has all the Wit :
He is the very Justice o ' Peace o ' the Play , and can commit
whom he will , and what he will , Errour , Absurdity , as the
toy takes him , and no Man say , Black is his Eye , but laugh
at him .
But they ha' no Fool i' this Play , I am afraid ,
It 's a wise Play then .
They are all Fools , the rather , in that .
Like enough .
My Husband ( Timothy Tattle , God rest his
poor Soul ) was wont to say , There was no Play without a
Fool and a Devil in't ; he was for the Devil still , God
bless him .
The Devil for his Money , would he say , I would
fain see the Devil .
And why would you so fain see the
Devil ?
would I say .
Because he has Horns , Wife , and may
be a Cuckold , as well as a Devil , he would answer .
You are
e 'en such another , Husband , quoth I.
Was the Devil ever
married ?
Where do you read , the Devil was ever so honou-
rable to commit Matrimony ?
The Play will tell us that ,
says he , we 'll go see 't to morrow , The Devil is an Ass .
He
is an errant learn 'd Man that made it , and can write , they
say ; and I am foully deceiv 'd , but he can read too .
I remember it , Gossip ; I went with you , by the
same token , Mrs. Trouble Truth dissuaded us , and told us ,
he was a profane Poet , and all his Plays had Devils in
them : That he kept School upo ' the Stage , could conjure there ,
above the School of Westminster , and Doctor Lamb too :
Not a Play he made , but had a Devil in it : And that he
would learn us all to make our Husbands Cuckolds at Plays :
By another token , that a young married Wife i' the Company
said , she could find in her heart to steal thither and see a
little o ' the Vanity through her Mask , and come practise at
O , it was Mistris ? ? ?
Nay , Gossip , I name no body .
It may be 'twas my
But was the Devil a proper Man , Gossip ?
As fine a Gentleman , of his Inches , as ever I saw
trusted to the Stage , or any where else ; and lov 'd the Com -
monwealth as well as e 're a Patriot of 'em all : He would
carry away the Vice on his back , quick to Hell , in every
Play where he came , and reform Abuses .
There was the Devil of Edmonton , no
such Man , I warrant you .
The Conjurer cosen 'd him with a Candles end ;
he was an Ass .
But there was one Smug , a Smith , would have
made a Horse laugh , and broke his Halter , as they say .
O , but the poor Man had got a shrewd mischance
one day .
How , Gossip ?
He had drest a Roguy Jade i' the morning , that
had the Staggers , and had got such a spice of 'em himself
by noon , as they would not away all the Play-time , do what
he could for his heart .
' Twas his Part , Gossip ; he was to be drunk by his
Say you so ?
I understood not so much .
Would we had such another Part , and
such a Man in this Play .
I fear 'twill be an excellent dull
Expect , intend it .
YOur Grace is sad , methinks , and melancholy !
You do not look upon me with that Face ,
As you were wont , my Goddess , bright Pecunia :
Altho your Grace be faln , of Two i' the Hundred ,
In Vulgar Estimation ; yet am I
Your Graces Servant still : and teach this body
To bend , and these my aged Knees to buckle ,
In Adoration , and just Worship of you .
Indeed , I do confess , I have no shape
To make a Minion of , but I 'm your Martyr ,
Your Graces Martyr .
I can hear the Rogues ,
As I do walk the Streets , whisper and point ,
There goes Old Peni-boy , the Slave of Money ,
Rich Peni-boy , Lady Pecunia 's Drudge ,
A sordid Rascal , one that never made
Good Meal in his Sleep , but sells the Acates are sent him ,
Fish , Fowl and Venison , and preserves himself ,
Like an Old hoary Rat , with mouldy Pye-Crust .
This I do hear , rejoicing , I can suffer
This , and much more for your good Graces sake .
Why do you so my Guardian ?
I not bid you ,
Cannot my Grace be gotten , and held too ?
Without your self-tormentings , and your watches ,
Your macerating of your body thus
With Cares and Scantings of your Diet and rest ?
O , no , your Services , my Princely Lady ,
Cannot with too much zeal of Rites be done ,
They are so sacred .
But my Reputation
May suffer , and the worship of my Family ,
When by so servile means they both are sought .
You are a Noble , Young , Free , Gracious Lady ,
And would be every bodies , in your Bounty ,
But you must not be so .
They are a few
That know your Merit , Lady , and can value 't .
Your self scarce understands your proper Powers ,
They are All-mighty , and that we your Servants ,
That have the Honour here to stand so near you ,
Know , and can use too .
All this Nether-world
Is yours , you command it , and do sway it ,
The Honour of it , and the Honesty ,
The Reputation , I , and the Religion ,
( I was about to say , and had not err 'd )
Is Queen Pecunia 's .
For that Stile is yours ,
If Mortals knew your Grace , or their own good .
Please your Grace to retire .
I fear your Grace
Hath tane too much of the sharp Air .
O , no!
I could endure to take a great deal more
( And with my Constitution , were it left )
Unto my choice , what think you of it , Statute ?
A little now and then does well , and keeps
Your Grace in your Complexion .
And true Temper .
But too much , Madam , may encrease cold
Rheumes ,
Nourish Catarrhs , Green Sicknesses and Agues ,
And put you in Consumption .
Best to take
Advice of your grave Women , Noble Madam ,
They know the State o ' your Body , and ha' studied
Your Graces Health .
And honour .
Here 'll be Visitants ,
Or Suitors by and by ; and 'tis not fit
They find you here .
' Twill make your Grace too cheap
To give them Audience presently .
Leave your Secretary ,
To answer them .
Wait you here , Broker .
I shall , Madam ,
And do your Graces Trusts with diligence .
I am come an Inch too late .
Do you hear , Sir ?
Is your Worship o ' the Family
Unto the Lady Pecunia ?
I serve her Grace , Sir ,
Aurelia Clara Pecunia , the Infanta .
Has she all those Titles , and her Grace besides ?
I must correct that Ignorance and Over-sight ,
Before I do present .
Sir , I have drawn
A Pedigree for her Grace , tho yet a Novice
In that so Noble Study .
A Herald at Arms ?
No, Sir , a Pursivant , my Name is Pyed-mantle .
Good Master Pyed-mantle .
I have deduc 'd her ? ?
From all the Spanish Mines in the West Indies ,
I hope : for she comes that way by her Mother ,
But by her Grand-mother , she 's Dutches of Mines .
From Man 's Creation I have brought her .
No farther ?
Before , Sir , long before , you have done nothing else ,
Your Mines were before Adam , search your Office ,
Roll Five and Twenty , you will find it so ,
I see you are but a Novice , Master Pyed-mantle ,
If you had not told me so .
Sir , an Apprentice
In Armoiry .
I have read the Elements ,
And Accidence , and all the leading Books ,
And I have now upon me a great ambition ,
How to be brought to her Grace , to kiss her Hands .
Why , if you have acquaintance with Mistris
Statute ,
Or Mistris Band , my Ladies Gentlewomen ,
They can induce you .
One is a Judges Daughter ,
But somewhat stately ; th ' other , Mistris Band ,
Her Father 's but a Scrivener , but she can
Almost as much with my Lady as the other ,
Especially if Rose Wax the Chambermaid
Be willing , Do you not know her , Sir , neither ?
No, in troth , Sir .
She 's a good pliant Wench ,
And easie to be wrought , Sir ; but the Nurse ,
Old Mother Mortgage , if you have a Tenement ,
Or such a Morsel , tho she have no Teeth ,
She loves a Sweet Meat , any thing that melts
In her warm Gums , she could command it for you
On such a trifle , a toy .
Sir , you may see
How for your Love , and this so pure Complexion ,
( A perfect Sanguine ) I ha' ventur 'd thus ,
The straining of a Ward , opening a Door
Into the Secrets of our Family .
I pray you let me know , Sir , unto whom
I am so much beholden ; but your name .
My name is Broker , I am Secretary
And Usher to her Grace .
Good Master Broker !
Good Master Pyed-mantle .
Why , you could do me ,
If you would , now , this Favour of your self .
Truly I think I could ; but if I would ,
I hardly should , without , or Mistris Band ,
Or Mistris Statute , please to appear in it .
Or the good Nurse I told you of , Mistris Mortgage .
We know our places here , we mingle not
One in another 's Sphere , but all move orderly ,
In our own Orbs ; yet we are all Concentricks .
Well , Sir , I 'll wait a better Season .
Do ,
And study the right means ; get Mistris Band
To urge on your behalf , or little Wax .
I have a hope , Sir , that I may , by chance ,
Light on her Grace , as she 's taking the Air .
That Air of Hope has blasted many an Airy
Of Castrils like your seif , good Master Pied-mantle .
boy leaps .
Well said , Mr. Secretary , I stood behind
And heard thee all .
I honour thy Dispatches .
If they be rude , untrained in our Method ,
And have not studied the Rule , dismiss 'em quickly .
He 'll never keep his Hour , that Vessel of Kitchen-stuff !
Pox upon him , Kidney ,
Always too late ! Lic .
To wish 'em you , I confess ,
That ha' them already .
What ?
The Pox ! P.
The Piles ,
The Plague , and all Diseases light on him ,
Knows not to keep his word .
I'ld keep my word , sure !
I hate that Man that will not keep his word .
When did I break my word ?
Or I , till now .
And 'tis but half an Hour .
Half a Year ,
To me , that stands upon a Minute of Time .
I am a just Man , I love still to be just .
Why ?
you think I can run like light-foot Ralph ,
Or keep a Wheel-barrow with a Sail in Town here ,
To whirl me to you .
I have lost two Stone
Of Suet i' the Service , posting hither :
You might have followed me like a Watering-pot ,
And seen the Knots I made along the Street ;
My Face dropt like the Skimmer in a Fritter-pan ,
And my whole Body is yet ( to say the truth )
A roasted Pound of Butter , with grated Bread in't !
Believe you , he that list .
You staid of purpose
To have my Venison stink , and my Fowl mortified ,
That you might ha' 'em ?
A Shilling or two cheaper ,
That 's your Jealousie .
Perhaps it is .
Will you go in , and view , and value all ?
Yonder is Venison sent me , Fowl , and Fish ,
In such abundance , I am sick to see it !
I wonder what they mean ! I ha' told 'em of it !
To burden a weak Stomach , and provoke
A dying Appetite ! thrust a Sin upon me
I ne 'er was guilty of ! nothing but Gluttony !
Gross Gluttony ! that will undo this Land !
And bating Two i' the Hundred .
I , that same 's
A crying Sin , a fearful damn 'd Device ,
Eats up the Poor , devours 'em ?
Sir , take heed
What you give out .
Against your grave great Solons ?
Num ? Pompilii , they that made that Law ?
To take away the Poor 's Inheritance :
It was their Portion ; I will stand to't :
And they have robb 'd 'em of it , plainly robb 'd 'em .
I still am a just Man , I tell the truth .
When Moneys went at Ten i' the Hundred , I ,
And such as I , the Servants of Pecunia ,
Could spare the Poor Two out of Ten , and did it :
How say you , Broker ?
Ask your Eccho . )
You did it .
I am for Justice ; when did I leave Justice ?
We knew 'twas theirs , they had Right and Title to't .
Now ?
You can spare 'em nothing .
Very little .
As good as nothing .
They have bound our Hands
What Licence , Knave , Informer ?
I am Lick-finger .
Your Cook .
A sawcy Jack you are , that 's once .
What said I , Broker ?
Nothing that I heard , Sir .
I know his Gift , he can be deaf when he list .
Ha' you provided me my Bushel of Eggs
I did bespeak ?
I do not care how stale
Or stinking that they be ; let 'em be rotten :
For Ammunition here , to pelt the Boys ,
That break my Windows .
Yes , Sir , I ha' spar 'd 'em
Out of the Custard-politick for you , the Mayor 's .
' Tis well ; go in , take hence all that Excess ,
Make what you can of it , your best : and when
I have Friends that I invite at home , provide me
Such , such , and such a Dish , as I bespeak ;
One at a time , no Superfluity .
Or if you have it not , return me Money :
You know my ways .
They are a little crooked .
How , Knave ?
Because you do indent .
' Tis true , Sir ,
I do indent you shall return me Money .
Rather than Meat , I know it : you are just still .
I love it still .
And therefore if you spend
The Red-Deer Pies i' your House , or sell 'em forth , Sir ,
Cast so , that I may have their Coffins all
Return 'd here , and pil 'd up : I would be thought
To keep some kind of House .
By the mouldy Signs ?
And then remember Meat for my two Dogs :
Fat Flaps of Mutton , Kidneys , Rumps of Veal ,
Good plenteous Scraps ; my Maid shall eat the Relicks .
When you and your Dogs have din 'd .
A sweet
Who 's here ?
my Courtier , and my little Doctor ?
My Muster-master ?
And what Plover 's that
They have brought to pull ?
I know not , some green Plover .
I 'll find him out .
Do , for I know the rest :
They are the Jeerers , mocking , flouting Jacks .
HOw now , old Money-Bawd ?
W' are come ?
To jeer me ,
As you were wont , I know you .
No, to give thee
Some good Security , and see Pecunia .
What is't ?
Our selves .
We 'll be one bound for another .
This noble Doctor here .
This worthy Courtier .
This Man o ' War , he was our Muster-master .
But a Sea-Captain now , brave Captain Shunfield .
You snuff the Air now , as the scent displeas 'd you .
Thou needst not fear him Man , his Credit is sound .
And season 'd too , since he took Salt at Sea .
I do not love pickl 'd Security ;
VVould I had one good Fresh-man in for all :
For truth is , you three stink .
You are a Rogue .
I think I am ; but I will lend no Money
On that Security , Captain .
Here 's a Gentleman ,
A Fresh-man i' the VVorld , one Master Madrigal .
Of an untainted Credit ; what say you to him ?
He 's gone , me thinks ; where is he ?
Madrigal ?
H' has an odd singing Name : is he an Heir ?
An Heir to a fair Fortune .
And full Hopes :
A dainty Scholar , and a pretty Poet !
Y'ave said enough .
I ha' no Money , Gentlemen ,
An' he go to't in Ryme once , not a Penny .
VVhy , he 's of Years , though he have little Beard .
His Beard has time to grow .
I have no Money .
Let him still dabble in Poetry .
No Pecunia
Is
Is to be seen .
Come , thou lov'st to be costive
Still i' thy Curt 'sie ; but I have a Pill ,
A golden Pill , to purge away this Melancholy .
' Tis nothing but his keeping o ' the House here ,
With his two drowsie Dogs .
A Drench of Sack
At a good Tavern , and a fine fresh Pullet ,
Would cure him .
Nothing but a young Heir in White-broth ;
I know his Diet better than the Doctor .
What , Lick-finger ?
mine old Host of Ram-ally ?
You ha' some Market here .
Some Dosser of Fish
Or Fowl to fetch off .
An odd Bargain of Venison
To drive .
Will you go in , Knave ?
I must needs ,
You see who drives me , Gentlemen .
Not the Devil .
He may be in time , he is his Agent now .
You are all cogging Jacks , a Covey o ' Wits ,
The Jeerers , that still call together at Meals :
Or rather an Airy ; for you are Birds of Prey ,
And fly at all ; nothing 's too big or high for you .
And are so truly fear 'd , but not belov 'd
One of another , as no one dares break
Company from the rest , lest they should fall
Upon him absent .
O ! the only Oracle
That ever peept or spake out of a Doublet .
How the Rogue stinks , worse than a Fishmon -
gers Sleeves !
Or Curriers Hands !
And such a par-boil 'd Visage !
His Face looks like a Diers Apron , just !
A sodden Head , and his whole Brain a Posset-curd !
I , now you jeer , jeer on ; I have no Money .
I wonder what Religion he 's of !
No certain species sure ! A kind of Mule !
That 's half an Ethnick , half a Christian !
I have no Money , Gentlemen .
This Stock .
He has no sense of any Vertue , Honour ,
Gentry , or Merit .
You say very right ,
My meritorious Captain , ( as I take it ! )
Merit will keep no House , nor pay no House-rent .
Will Mistris Merit go to Market , think you ,
Set on the Pot , or feed the Family ?
Will Gentry clear with the Butcher , or the Baker ?
Fetch in a Pheasant , or a Brace of Partridges ,
From Goodwife Poulter , for my Ladies Supper .
See ! this pure Rogue !
This Rogue has Money though ;
My worshipful brave Courtier has no Money ;
No, nor my valiant Captain .
Hang you , Rascal .
Nor you , my learned Doctor .
I lov 'd you
While you did hold your Practice , and kill Tripe-wives ,
And kept you to your Urinal ; but since your Thumbs
Have greas 'd the Ephemerides , casting Figures ,
And turning over for your Candle-rents ,
And your Twelve Houses in the Zodiack ,
With your Almutens , Alma cantaras
Troth you shall cant alone for Peni-boy .
I told you what we should find him , a meer Bawd .
A Rogue , a Cheater .
What you please , Gentlemen :
I am of that humble nature and condition ,
Never to mind your Worships , or take notice
Of what you throw away thus .
I keep House here
Like a lame Cobler , never out of doors ,
With my two Dogs , my Friends ; and ( as you say )
Drive a quick pretty Trade , still .
I get Money :
And as for Titles , be they Rogue , or Rascal ,
Or what your Worships fansie , let 'em pass
As transitory things ; they 're mine to day ,
And yours to morrow .
Hang thee , Dog .
Thou Cur ,
You see how I do blush , and am asham 'd
Of these large Attributes ?
Yet you have no Money .
Well Wolf , Hyena , you old pocky Rascal ,
You will ha' the Hernia fall down again
Into your Scrotum , and I shall be sent for .
I will remember then , that , and your Fistula
In ano I cur 'd you of .
Thank your Dog-leech Craft :
They were 'holesom Piles , afore you meddl 'd with 'em .
What an ungrateful Wretch is this ?
He minds
A Courtesie no more , than London-bridge ,
What Arch was mended last .
He never thinks ,
More than a Log , of any Grace at Court
A Man may do him ; or that such a Lord
Reach't him his Hand .
O yes ! If Grace would strike
The Brewer 's Tally , or my good Lords Hand
Would quit the Scores .
But , Sir , they will not do it .
a Piece .
Here 's a Piece , my good Lord Piece , doth all ;
Goes to the Butchers , fetches in a Mutton ;
Then to the Bakers , brings in Bread , makes Fires ,
Gets Wine , and does more real Courtesies
Than all my Lords , I know : My sweet Lord Piece !
You are my Lord , the rest are cogging Jacks ,
Under the Rose .
Rogue , I could beat you now .
True , Captain , if you durst beat any other ,
I should believe you ; but indeed you are hungry ;
You are not angry , Captain , if I know you
Aright , good Captain .
No Pecunia
Is to be seen , though Mistris Band would speak ,
Or little Blushet-Wax be ne 'er so easie ;
I 'll stop mine Ears with her , against the Syrens ,
Court , and Philosophy .
God be wi' you , Gentlemen ;
Provide you better Names , Pecunia is for you .
What a damn 'd Harpy it is ! Where 's Madrigal ?
Is he sneak 'd hence ?
Here he comes with Broker ,
Pecunia 's Secretary .
He may do some good
With him perhaps .
Where ha' you been , Madrigal ?
Above , with my Ladies Women , reading Verses .
That was a Favour .
Good morrow , Mr. Secretary .
Good morrow , Mr. Usher .
Sir , by both
Your worshipful Titles , and your Name , Mas Broker ,
Good morrow .
I did ask him if he were
Amphibion Broker .
Why ?
A Creature of two Natures ,
Because he has two Offices .
You may jeer ,
You ha' the Wits , young Gentlemen : But your hope
Of Helicon will never carry it here ,
With our fat Family ; we ha' the dullest ,
Most unbor 'd Ears for Verse amongst our Females .
I griev 'd you read so long , Sir ; old Nurse Mortgage
She snoar 'd i' the Chair , and Statute ( if you mark 'd her )
Fell fast asleep , and Mistris Band she nodded ,
But not with any consent to what you read .
They must have somewhat else to chink , than Rymes .
If you could make an Epitaph on your Land ,
( Imagine it on departure ) such a Poem
Would wake 'em , and bring Wax to her true temper .
I ' faith , Sir , and I will try .
' Tis but Earth ,
Fit to make Bricks and Tyles of .
Pox upon't ,
' Tis but for Pots , or Pipkins at the best .
If it would keep us in good Tabacco-pipes ,
' Twere worth keeping .
Or in Porc'lane Dishes ,
There were some hope .
But this is a hungry Soil ,
And must be helpt .
Who would hold any Land ,
To have the trouble to Marl it ?
Not a Gentleman .
Let Clowns and Hinds affect it , that love Plows ,
And Carts , and Harrows , and are busie still
In vexing the dull Element .
Our sweet Songster
Shall rarifi't into Air .
And you , Mas Broker ,
Shall have a feeling .
So it supple , Sir ,
The Nerves .
O ! it shall be palpable ,
Make thee run through a Hoop , or a Thumb-Ring ,
The Nose of a Tabacco-pipe , and draw
Thy ductile Bones out , like a Knitting-needle ,
To
To serve my subtil turns .
I shall obey , Sir ,
And run a Thred , like an Hour-glass .
Where is Broker ?
Are not these Flies gone yet ?
Pray ' quit my House ,
I 'll smoak you out else .
O ! the Prodigal !
Will you be at so much Charge with us , and Loss ?
I have heard you ha' offer 'd , Sir , to lock up smoak ,
And cauk your Windows , spar up all your Doors ,
Thinking to keep it a close Prisoner wi' you ,
And wept when it went out , Sir , at your Chimney .
And yet his Eyes were drier than a Pumice .
A wretched Rascal , that will bind about
The Nose of his Bellows , lest the Wind get out
When he 's abroad .
Sweeps down no Cobwebs here ,
But sells 'em for cut Fingers ; and the Spiders ,
As Creatures rear 'd of Dust , and cost him nothing ,
To fat old Ladies Monkeys .
He has offer 'd
To gather up spilt Water , and preserve
Each Hair falls from him , to stop Balls withal .
A Slave , and an Idolater to Pecunia !
You all have happy Memories , Gentlemen ,
In rocking my poor Cradle .
I remember too ,
VVhen you had Lands and Credit , VVorship , Friends ,
I , and could give Security : Now you have none ,
Or will have none right shortly .
This can Time ,
And the vicissitude of Things .
I have
All these , and Money too , and do possess 'em ,
And am right heartily glad of all our Memories ,
And both the Changes .
Let us leave the Viper .
He 's glad he is rid of his Torture , and so soon .
Broker , come hither , up , and tell your Lady ,
She must be ready presently , and Statute ,
Band , Mortgage , Wax : My prodigal young Kinsman
VVill streight be here to see her ; 'top of our House ,
The flourishing and flanting Peni-boy .
VVe were but three of us in all the world ,
My Brother Francis , whom they call 'd Frank Peni-boy ,
Father to this ; he 's dead .
This Peni-boy
Is now the Heir ! I , Richer Peni-boy ,
Not Richard , but old Harry Peni-boy ,
And ( to make Ryme ) close , wary Peni-boy ,
I shall have all at last , my hopes do tell me .
Go , see all ready ; and where my Dogs have faulted ,
Remove it with a Broom , and sweeten all
VVith a Slice of Juniper , not too much , but sparing ,
VVe may be faulty our selves else , and turn prodigal ,
In entertaining of the Prodigal .
Here he is ; and with him ?
what ! a Clapper-Dudgeon !
That 's a good Sign , to have the Beggar follow him
So near , at his first entry into Fortune .
Hid in the Study .
HOw now , old Uncle ?
I am come to see thee ,
And the brave Lady here , the Daughter of Ophir ,
They say thou keepst .
Sweet Nephew , if she were
The Daughter of the Sun , she 's at your service ,
And so am I , and the whole Family ,
VVorshipful Nephew .
Saist thou so , dear Uncle ?
VVelcome my Friends then : Here is Domine Picklock ,
My Man o ' Law , sollicits all my Causes ,
Follows my Business , makes and compounds my Quarrels
Between my Tenants and me ; sows all my Strifes ,
And reaps them too ; troubles the Country for me ,
And vexes any Neighbour that I please .
But with Commission ?
Under my Hand and Seal .
A worshipful Place !
I thank his VVorship for it .
But what is this old Gentleman .
A Rogue ,
A very Canter , I , Sir , one that maunds
Upon the Pad : VVe should be Brothers though ;
For you are near as wretched as my self ,
You dare not use your Money , and I have none .
Not use my Money , cogging Jack ! who uses it
At better Rates ?
lets it for more i' the Hundred ,
Than I do , Sirrah ?
Be not angry , Uncle .
VVhat ?
to disgrace me , with my Queen , as if
I did not know her Value .
Sir , I meant
You durst not to enjoy it .
Hold your peace ,
You are a Jack .
Uncle , he shall be a John ,
And you go to that , as good a Man as you are :
An' I can make him so , a better Man ;
Perhaps I will too .
Come , let us go .
Nay , Kinsman ,
My worshipful Kinsman , and the top of our House ,
Do not your penitent Uncle that Affront ,
For a rash word , to leave his joyful Threshold ,
Before you see the Lady that you long for ,
The Venus of the Time and State , Pecunia !
I do perceive , your Bounty loves the Man ,
For some concealed Vertue , that he hides
Under those Rags .
I owe my Happiness to him ,
The waiting on his Worship , since I brought him
The happy News , welcome to all young Heirs .
Thou didst indeed , for which I thank thee yet .
Your Fortunate Princess , Uncle , is long a coming .
She is not rigg 'd , Sir ; setting forth some Lady ,
Will cost as much as furnishing a Fleet .
Here she 's come at last , and like a Gally
Gilt i' the Prow .
Is this Pecunia ?
Vouchsafe my toward Kinsman , gracious Madam ,
The Favour of your Hand .
Nay of my Lips Sir ,
To him .
She kisses like a mortal Creature .
Almighty Madam , I have long 'd to see you .
And I have my desire , Sir , to behold
That Youth and Shape , which in my Dreams and Wakes
I have so oft contemplated , and felt
Warm in my Veins , and native as my Blood .
When I was told of your arrival here ,
I felt my Heart beat , as it would leap out
In Speech ; and all my Face it was a Flame :
But how it came to pass , I do not know .
O ! Beauty loves to be more proud than Nature ,
That made you blush .
I cannot satisfie
My curious Eyes , by which alone I 'm happy ,
In my beholding you .
They pass the Complement
Prettily well .
I , he does kiss her , I like him .
My Passion was clear contrary , and doubtful ,
I shook for fear , and yet I danc 'd for joy ,
I had such Motions as the Sun-beams make
Against a Wall , or playing on a Water ,
Or trembling Vapour of a boyling Pot ?
That 's not so good ; it should ha' been a Crucible
VVith molten Metal , she had understood it .
I cannot talk , but I can love you , Madam :
Are these your Gentlewomen ?
I love them too .
And which is Mistris Statute ?
Mistris Band ?
They all kiss close , the last stuck to my Lips .
It was my Ladies Chamber-maid , soft Wax .
Soft Lips she has , I am sure on't .
Mother Mortgage
I 'll owe a Kiss , till she be younger .
Statute ,
Sweet Mistris Band , and honey , little Wax ,
VVe must be better acquainted .
VVe are but Servants , Sir .
But whom her Grace is so content to grace ,
VVe shall observe .
And with all fit respect .
In our poor Places .
Being
Being her Graces Shadows .
A fine well-spoken Family .
What 's thy name ?
Methinks my Uncle should not need thee ,
Who is a crafty Knave enough , believe it .
Art thou her Graces Steward ?
No, her Usher , Sir .
What , o ' the Hall ?
thou hast a sweeping Face ,
Thy Beard is like a Broom .
No barren Chin , Sir ,
I am no Eunuch , though a Gentleman-Usher .
Thou shalt go with us .
Uncle I must have
My Princess forth to day .
Whither you please , Sir ,
You shall command her .
I will do all grace
To my new Servant .
Thanks unto your bounty ;
He is my Nephew , and my Chief , the Point ,
Tip , Top , and Tuft of all our Family !
But , Sir , condition 'd always you return
Statute , and Band home , with my sweet , soft Wax ,
And my good Nurse , here , Mortgage .
O ! what else ?
By Broker .
Do not fear .
She shall go wi' you ,
Whither you please , Sir , any where .
I see
A Money-Bawd , is lightly a Flesh-Bawd too .
Are you advis 'd ?
Now o ' my faith , this Canter
Would make a good grave Burgess in some Barn .
Come , thou shalt go with us Uncle .
By no means , Sir .
We 'll have both Sack , and Fidlers .
I 'll not draw that charge upon your Worship .
He speaks modestly ,
And like an Uncle .
But Mas Broker , here ,
He shall attend you , Nephew ; her Graces Usher ,
And what you fancy to bestow on him ,
Be not too lavish , use a temperate Bounty ,
I 'll take it to my self .
I will be Princely ,
While I possess my Princess , my Pecunia .
Where is't you eat ?
Hard by , at Picklocks Lodging ,
Old Lickfinger 's the Cook , here in Ram-Alley .
He has good Chear ; perhaps I 'll come and see you .
O , fie ! an Alley , and a Cooks-shop , gross ,
' Twill favour , Sir , most rankly of 'em both .
Let your Meat rather follow you to a Tavern .
A Tavern 's as unfit too for a Princess .
No, I have known a Princess , and a great one ,
Come forth of a Tavern .
Not go in , Sir , though .
She must go in , if she came forth : the blessed
Pokahontas ( as the Historian calls her
And great Kings Daughter of Virginia )
Hath been in Womb of a Tavern ; and besides ,
Your nasty Uncle will spoil all your mirth ,
And be as noysom .
That 's true .
No 'faith ,
Dine in Apollo with Pecunia ,
At brave Duke Wadloos , have your Friends about you ,
And make a day on't .
Content 'i faith :
Our Meat shall be brought thither .
Simon the King ,
Will bid us welcom .
Patron , I have a suit .
What 's that ?
That you will carry the Infanta
To see the Staple , her Grace will be a grace ,
To all the Members of it .
I will do it :
And have her Arms set up there , with her Titles ,
Aurelia Clara Pecunia , the Infanta .
And in Apollo .
Come ( sweet Princess ) go .
Broker , be careful of your charge .
I warrant you .
some on us be not a Witch , Gossip , to forespeak the matter thus .
I fear we are all such , and we were old enough :
But we are not all old enough to make one Witch .
How like
you the Vice i' the Play .
Which is he ?
Three or four : old Covetousness , the sordid Peni-
boy , the Money-bawd , who is a Flesh-bawd too , they say .
But here is never a Fiend to carry him away .
Besides , he has never a Wooden Dagger ! I'ld not give a Rush
for a Vice , that has not a Wooden Dagger to snap at every
body he meets .
That was the old way , Gossip , when Iniquity
came in like Hokos Pokos , in a Juglers Jerkin , with false
Skirts , like the Knave of Clubs ! but now they are attir 'd like
Men and Women o ' the time , the Vices Male and Female !
Podigality like a young Heir , and his Mistris Money
( whose Favours he scatters like Counters ) prank't up like a
prime Lady , the Infanta of the Mines .
I , therein they abuse an honourable Princess , it is
By whom is it so thought ?
or where lyes the abuse ?
Plain in the stiling her Infanta , and giving her
three Names .
Take heed it lye not in the Vice of your interpreta -
tion : what have Aurelia , Clara , Pecunia to do with any
Person ?
do they any more , but express the property of Money ,
which is the Daughter of Earth , and drawn out of the Mines ?
Is there nothing to be call 'd Infanta , but what is subject to
exception ?
Why not the Infanta of the Beggers ?
or Infanta
o ' the Gipsies ?
as well as King of Beggers , and King of
Gipsies ?
Well , and there were no wiser than I , I would sow
him in a Sack , and send him by Sea to his Princess .
Faith , and he heard you , Censure , he would go
near to stick the Asses Ears to your high dressing , and per-
haps to all ours for harkening to you .
By 'r Lady but he should not to mine , I would
harken , and harken , and censure , if I saw cause , for th '
other Princess sake Pokahontas , surnam 'd the Blessed ,
whom he has abus 'd indeed ( and I do censure him , and will
censure him ) to say she came forth of a Tavern , was said
like a paltry Poet .
That 's but one Gossips Opinion , and my Gossip
Tattle 's too ! but what says Expectation , here , she sits sullen
and silent .
Troth I expect their Office , their great Of -
fice ! the Staple , what it will be ! they have talk't on't , but
we see 't not open yet ; would Butter would come in , and
spread it self a little to us .
Or the Butter-box , Buz , the Emissary .
When it is churn 'd , and dish't , we shall hear of it .
If it be fresh and sweet Butter ; but say it
be sowr and wheyish .
Then it is worth nothing , meer Pot Butter , fit to
be spent in Suppositories , or greasing Coach-wheels , stale
stinking Butter , and such I fear it is , by the being barrell 'd
up so long .
Expectation , Or rank Irish Butter .
Have patience Gossip , say that , contrary to our ex -
pectation , it prove right , seasonable , salt Butter .
Or to the time of year , in Lent , delicate Almond
Butter ! I have a sweet Tooth yet , and I will hope the best ;
and sit down as quiet and calm as Butter ; look as smooth
and soft as Butter ; be merry and melt like Butter ; laugh
and be fat like Butter : so Butter answer my Expectation ,
and be not mad butter ; If it be : It shall both July and De-
cember see !
I say no more , but ?

YOu hunt upon a wrong scent still , and think
The Air of things will carry 'em , but it must
Be reason and proportion , not fine sounds ,
My cousin Cymball , must get you this Lady .
You have entertain 'd a Pettyfogger here ,
Picklock , with trust of an Emissaries Place ,
And he is all for the young Prodigal ,
You see he has left us .
Come , you do not know him ,
That speak thus of him .
He will have a Trick ,
To open us a gap by a Trap-door ,
When they least dream on't .
Here he comes .
What news ?
Where is my Brother Buz ?
my Brother Ambler ?
The Register , Examiner , and the Clerks ?
Appear , and let us muster all in Pomp ,
For here will be the rich Infanta , presently ,
To make her visit .
Peni-boy the Heir ,
My Patron , has got leave for her to play
With all her Train , of the old Churl her Guardian .
Now is your time to make all court unto her ,
That she may first but know , then love the Place ,
And shew it by her frequent visits here :
And afterwards get her to sojourn with you .
She will be weary of the Prodigal quickly .
Excellent news !
And counsel of an Oracle !
How say you Cousin Fitton ?
Brother Picklock ,
I shall adore thee for this parcel of Tidings ,
It will cry up the Credit of our Office
Eternally , and make our Staple Immortal !
Look your Addresses then be fair and fit ,
And entertain her and her Creatures too ,
With all the Migniardise , and quaint Caresses
You can put on 'em .
Thou seem 'st by thy Language ,
No less a Courtier than a Man o ' Law .
I must embrace thee .
Tut , I am Vertumnus ,
On every change , or chance , upon occasion ,
A true Cham?lion , I can colour for't .
I move upon my Axel like a Turn-pike ,
Fit my Face to the Parties , and become
Streight one of them .
Sirs , up into your Desks ,
And spred the Rolls upon the Table , so .
Is the Examiner set ?
Yes , Sir .
Ambler and Buz are both abroad now .
We 'll sustain their Parts .
No matter , let them ply the Affairs without ,
Let us alone within , I like that well .
On with the Cloke , and you with the Staple Gown ,
And keep your State , stoop only to the Infanta ;
We 'll have a flight at Mortgage , Statute , Band ,
And hard , but we 'll bring Wax unto the retrive :
Each know his several Province , and discharge it .
I do admire this nimble Ingine , Picklock .
Cuz , What did I say ?
You have rectified my Error !
BY your leave Gentlemen , what news ?
good , good still ?
I ' your new Office ?
Princess , here 's the Staple !
This is the Governor , kiss him , noble Princess ,
For my sake .
Thom , how is it honest Thom ?
How does thy Place , and thou ?
My Creature , Princess ,
This is my Creature , give him your Hand to kiss ,
He was my Barber , now he writes Clericus !
I bought this Place for him , and gave it him .
He should have spoke of that , Sir , and not you :
Two do not do one Office well .
' Tis true ,
But I am loth to lose my Curtesies .
So are all they that do them to vain ends ,
And yet you do lose , when you pay your selves
No more o ' your Sentences , Canter , they are stale ,
We come for News , remember where you are .
I pray thee let my Princess hear some News ,
Good Master Cymbal .
What news would she hear ?
Or of what kind , Sir ?
Any , any kind ,
So it be News , the newest that thou hast ,
Some News of State for a Princess .
Read from Rome there .
They write , the King of Spain is chosen Pope .
How ?
And Emperor too , the Thirtieth of February .
Is the Emperor dead ?
No, but he has resign 'd ,
And trails a Pike now , under Tilly .
For Penance .
These will beget strange turns in Christendom !
And Spinola is made General of the Jesuits .
Stranger ! Fit .
Sir , all are alike true and certain .
All the pretence to the Fifth Monarchy
and Secular Power .
Was held but vain , until the Ecclesiastick
And Secular Powers were united thus ,
Both in one Person .
' T has been long the aim
Of the House of Austria .
See but Maximilian
His Letters to the Baron of Bouttersheim ,
Or Scheiter-huyssen .
No, of Liechtenstein ,
Lord Paul , I think .
I have heard of some such thing .
Don Spinola made General of the Jesuits !
A Priest ! Cym .
O , no , he is dispens 'd withal ,
And the whole Society , who do now appear
The only Engineers of Christendom .
They have been thought so long , and rightly too .
Witness the Engine that they have presented him ,
To wind himself with , up into the Moon ,
And thence make all his Discoveries ! Cym .
Read on .
And Vittellesco , he that was last General ,
Being now turn 'd Cook to the Society ,
Has drest his Excellence such a Dish of Eggs ?
What potch 'd ?
No, powder 'd .
All the Yolk is Wild-fire ,
As he shall need beleaguer no more Towns ,
But throw his Egg in .
It shall clear consume
Palace and Place ; demolish and bear down
All strengths before it ! Cym .
Never be extinguish 'd ,
Till all become one ruine ! Fit .
And from Florence .
They write was found in Galil?o 's Study ,
A burn -
A burning Glass ( which they have sent him too )
To Fire any Fleet that 's out at Sea ? ?
By Moonshine , is't not so ?
Yes , Sir , i' the Water .
His strengths will be unresistable , if this hold !
Ha' you no News against him on the contrary ?
Yes , Sir , they write here , one Cornelius-Son ,
Hath made the Hallanders an invisible Eel ,
To swim the Haven at Dunkirk , and sink all
The Shipping there .
Why ha' not you this , Thom ?
Because be keeps the Pontificial side .
How , change sides , Thom .
' Twas never in my
thought
To put thee up against our selves .
Come down ,
Why , Sir ?
I venter 'd not my Money
Upon those Terms : If he may change , why so .
I 'll ha' him keep his own side , sure .
Why , let him ,
' Tis but writing so much over again .
For that I 'll bear the charge : There 's two Pieces ,
Come , do not stick with the Gentleman .
I 'll take none , Sir .
And yet he shall ha' the Place .
They shall be Ten then ,
Up Thom : and th ' Office shall take 'em .
Keep your side , Thom .
Know your own side , do not forsake your side , Thom .
They write here one Cornelius-Son ,
Hath made the Hollanders an invisible Eel ,
To swim the Haven at Dunkirk , and sink all
The shipping there .
But how is't done ?
I 'll shew you , Sir .
It is an Automa , runs under Water ,
With a snug Nose , and has a nimble Tail
Made like an Auger , with which Tail she wrigles
Betwixt the Coasts of a Ship , and sinks it streight .
Whence ha' you this News .
From a right Hand I assure you ,
The Eel Boats here , that lye before Queen-Hythe ,
Came out of Holland .
A most brave Device ,
To murder their flat bottoms .
I do grant you :
But what if Spinola have a new Project :
To bring an Army over in Cork-shooes ,
And land them here at Harwich ?
all his Horse
Are shod with Cork , and fourscore Pieces of Ordinance ,
Mounted upon Cork-carriages , with Bladders
In stead of Wheels to run the Passage over
At a Spring-tide .
Is't true ?
As true as the rest .
He 'll never leave his Engines : I would hear now
Some curious News .
As what ?
Magick or Alchimy ,
Or flying i' the Air , I care not what .
They write from Libtzig ( Reverence to your Ears )
The Art of drawing Farts out of dead Bodies ,
Is by the Brotherhood of the Rosie Cross ,
Produc 'd unto Perfection , in so sweet
And rich a Tincture ?
As there is no Princess ,
But may perfume her Chamber with th ' Extraction .
There 's for you , Princess .
What , a Fart for her ?
I mean the Spirit .
Beware how whe resents it .
And what hast thou , Thom ?
The perpetual Motion ,
Is here found out by an Ale-wife in Saint Katherines ,
At the Sign o ' the dancing Bears .
What , from her Tap ?
I 'll go see that , or else I 'll send old Canter .
He can make that discovery .
Yes , in Ale .
Let me have all this News , made up , and seal 'd .
The People press upon us .
Please you , Sir ,
Withdraw with your fair Princess .
There 's a Room
Within , Sir , to retire too .
No, good Register ,
We 'll stand it out here , and observe your Office ;
What News it issues .
' Tis the House of Fame , Sir ,
Where both the Curious and the Negligent ;
The Scrupulous and Careless ; Wild and Stay 'd ;
The Idle and Laborious ; all do meet ,
To taste the Cornu copi? of her Rumors ,
Which she , the Mother of Sport , pleaseth to scatter
Among the vulgar : Baits , Sir , for the People !
And they will bite like Fishes .
Let 's see 't .
Ha' you in your profane Shop , any News .
A she Baptist .
O' the Saints at Amsterdam ?
Yes , how much would you ?
Six Penny worth .
Lay your Money down , read Thomas .
The Saints do write , they expect a Prophet , shortly ,
The Prophet Baal , to be sent over to them ,
To calculate a Time , and half a Time ,
And the whole Time , according to Naometry .
What 's that ?
The measuring o ' the Temple : a Cabal
Found out but lately , and set out by Archie ,
Or some such Head , of whose long Coat they have heard ,
And being black , desire it .
Peace be with them !
So there had need , for they are still by the Ears
One with another .
It is their Zeal .
Most likely .
Have you no other of that species ?
Yes ,
But dearer , it will cost you a Shilling .
Verily ,
There is a Nine-pence , I will shed no more .
Not to the good o ' the Saints ?
I am not sure ,
That Man is good .
Read , from Constantinople ,
Nine penny 'orth .
They give out here , the Grand
Signior
Is certainly turn 'd Christian , and to clear
The Controversie 'twixt the Pope and him ,
Which is the Antichrist ; he means to visit
The Church at Amsterdam , this very Summer ,
And quit all Marks o ' the Beast .
Now joyful Tydings .
Who brought in this ?
Which Emissary ?
Your Country man .
Now , blessed be the Man ,
And his whole Family , with the Nation .
Yes , for Amboyna , and the Justice there !
This is a Doper , a she Anabaptist !
Seal and deliver her her News , dispatch .
Ha' you any News from the Indies ?
any Miracle
Done in Japan by the Jesuites ?
or in China ?
No, but we hear of a Colony of Cooks
To be set a shore o ' the Coast of America ,
For the conversion of the Caniballs ,
And making them good eating Christians .
Here comes the Colonel that undertakes it .
Who ?
Captain Lickfinger ?
by Colonel Lickfinger .
News , news my Boys !
I am to furnish a great Feast to day ,
And I would have what News the Office affords .
We were venting some of you , of your new project .
Afore 'twas paid for , you were somewhat too hasty .
What Lickfinger ! wilt thou convert the Caniballs ,
With Spit and Pan Divinity ?
Sir , for that
I will not urge , but for the Fire and Zeal
L l l 2 To
To the true Cause ; thus I have undertaken :
With two Lay-brethren , to my self , no more ,
One o ' the broach , th ' other o ' the boyler ,
In one six Months , and by plain Cookery ,
No Magick to't , but old Japhets Physick ,
The Father of the Europ?an Arts ,
Yo make such Sauces for the Savages ,
And Cooks their Meats , with those inticing Steems ,
As it would make our Canibal-Christians
Forbear the mutual eating one another ,
Which they do do , more cunningly , then the wild
Anthropophagi , that snatch only strangers ,
Like my old Patrons Dogs there .
O , my Uncles !
Is Dinner ready , Lickfinger ?
When you please , Sir .
I was bespeaking but a Parcel of News ,
To strew out the long Meal withal , but't seems
You are furnish 'd here already .
O , not half !
What Court-news is there ?
any Proclamations ,
Or Edicts to come forth ?
Yes , there is one ?
That the Kings Barber has got , for aid of our Trade :
Whereof there is a manifest decay .
A Precept for the wearing of long Hair ,
To run to Seed , to sow bald Pates withal ,
And the preserving fruitful Heads , and Chins ,
To help a Mystery almost antiquated .
Such as are bald and barren beyond hope ,
Are to be separated and set by
For Ushers to old Countesses .
And Coachmen ,
To mount their Boxes reverently , and drive ,
Like Lapwings , with a Shell upo ' their Heads ,
Thorow the Streets .
Ha' you no News o ' the Stage ?
They 'll ask me about new Plays at Dinner time .
And I should be as dumb as a Fish .
O ! yes ,
There is a Legacy left to the King 's Players ,
Archbishop of Spalato .
He is dead that play 'd him !
Then h ' has lost his share o ' the Legacy .
What news of Gundomar ?
A second Fistula ,
so called .
Or an Excoriation ( at least )
For putting the poor English play , was writ of him ,
To such a sordid use , as ( is said ) he did ,
Of cleansing his Posterior 's .
Justice ! Justice !
Since when , he lives Condemn 'd to his share
at Bruxels ,
And there sits filing certain politick Hinges ,
To hang the States on , h ' has heav 'd off the Hooks .
What must you have for these ?
Thou shalt pay nothing ,
But reckon 'em 'i the Bill .
There 's twenty Pieces ,
Her Grace bestows upon the Office , Thom :
VVrite thou that down for News .
We may well do 't ,
We have not many such .
There 's Twenty more ,
If you say so ; my Princess is a Princess !
And put that too , under the Office Seal .
takes Pecunia aside , courts and woos her to
the Office .
If it will please your Grace to sojourn here ,
And take my Roof for covert , you shall know
The Rites belonging to your Blood and Birth ,
Which few can apprehend : these sordid Servants ,
Which rather are your Keepers , then Attendants ,
Should not come near your Presence .
I would have
You waited on by Ladies , and your Train
Born up by Persons of Quality and Honour ;
Your Meat should be serv 'd in with curious Dances ,
And set upon the Board with Virgin hands ,
Tun 'd to their Voices ; not a Dish remov 'd ,
But to the Musick , nor a drop of Wine ,
Mixt with his Water , without Harmony .
You are a Courtier , Sir , or somewhat more ?
That have this tempting Language !
I 'm your Servant ,
Excellent Princess , and would ha' you appear
That which you are .
Come forth State , and wonder ,
Of these our Times , dazle the vulgar Eyes ,
And strike the People blind with admiration .
Why , that 's the end of Wealth ! thrust Riches
outward ,
And remain Beggers within : contemplate nothing
But the vile sordid things of Time , Place , Money ,
And let the Noble and the Precious go ;
Vertue and Honesty , hang 'em ; poor thin Membranes
Of Honour ; who respects them ?
O , the Fates !
How hath all just true Reputation fall 'n ,
Since Money , this base Money 'gan to have any !
while , and is jeered by them .
Pitty the Gentleman is not Immortal .
As he gives out , the Place is by description .
A very Paradise , if you saw all , Lady .
I am the Chamber-maid , Sir , you mistake ,
My Lady may see all .
Sweet Mistris Statute , gentle Mistris Band ,
And Mother Mortgage , do but get her Grace
To sojourn here .
?
I thank you gentle Wax .
If it were a Chattel , I would try my Credit .
So it is , for Term of Life , we count it so .
She means Inheritance to him and his Heirs :
Or that he could assure a State of years :
I 'll be his Statute-Staple , Statute-Merchant ,
Or what he please .
He can expect no more .
His Cousin , Alderman Security ,
That he did talk of so , e 'en now ?
Who is
The very Broch o ' the Bench , Gem o ' the City .
He and his Deputy , but assure his Life
For one Seven years .
And see what we 'll do for him ,
Upon his Scarlet Motion .
And old Chain ,
That draws the City-ears .
When he says nothing ,
But twirls it thus .
A moving Oratory !
Dumb Rhetorick and silent Eloquence !
As the fine Poet says ! Fit .
Come , they all scorn us ,
Do you not see 't ?
the Family of scorn !
Do not believe him ! gentle Master Picklock ,
They understood you not : the Gentlewomen ,
They thought you would ha' my Lady sojourn with you ,
And you desire but now and then a Visit ?
Yes , if she pleas 'd , Sir , it would much advance
Unto the Office her continual Residence !
( I speak but as a Member . )
' Tis enough .
I apprehend you .
And it shall go hard ,
But I 'll so work , as some body shall work her !
'Pray you change with our Master , but a word
about it .
Well , Lickfinger , see that our Meat be ready ,
Thou hast News enough .
Something of Bethlem Gabor ,
And then I 'm gone .
We hear he has devis 'd
A Drum , to fill all Christendom with the sound :
But that he cannot draw his Forces near it ,
To march yet , for the violence of the noise .
And therefore he is fain by a design ,
To carry 'em in the Air , and at some distance ,
Till he be married , then they shall appear .
Or never ; well , God b' wi' you ( stay , who 's here ? )
A little of the Duke of Bavier , and then ?
H' has taken a gray Habit , and is turn 'd
The Churches Miller , grinds the Catholick Grist
With every Wind : and Tilly takes the Toll .
Ha' you any news o ' the Pageants to send down
The Pageants .
Into
Into the several Counties ?
All the Country
Expected from the City most brave Speeches ,
Now , at the Coronation .
It expected
More than it understood : for they stand mute ,
Poor innocent dumb things ; they are but Wood ,
As is the Bench and Blocks , they were wrought on ; yet
If May-day come , and the Sun shine , perhaps ,
They 'll sing like Memnon 's Statue , and be vocal .
Ha' you any Forrest-news ?
The new Park in the Forrest of Fools .
None very wild , Sir ,
Some tame there is , out o ' the Forrest of Fools ,
A new Park is a making there , to sever
Cuckolds of Antler , from the Raskals .
Such
Whose Wives are dead , and have since cast their Heads ,
Shall remain Cuckolds-pollard .
I 'll ha' that news .
And I.
And I.
And I.
And I.
And I.
Sir , I desire to be excus 'd ; and , Madam ,
I cannot leave my Office the first day .
My Cousin Fitton here , shall wait upon you ,
And Emissary Picklock .
And Thom .
Clericus ?
I cannot spare him yet , but he shall follow you ,
When they have ordered the Rolls .
Shut up th ' Office ,
When you ha' done , 'till two a Clock .
Where shall we dine to day ?
do you know ?
the Jeerers .
Where 's my fellow Fitton ?
New gone forth .
Cannot your Office tell us , what brave fellows
Do eat together to Day , in Town , and where ?
Yes , there 's a Gentleman , the brave Heir , young
Peni-boy ,
Dines in Apollo .
Come , let 's thither then ,
I ha' supt in Apollo! Alm .
With the Muses .
No,
But with two Gentlewomen , call 'd the Graces .
They ' were ever three in Poetry .
This was truth , Sir .
Sir , Master Fitton 's there too ! Shun .
All the better !
We may have a jeer , perhaps .
Yes , you 'll drink , Doctor ,
( If there be any good Meat ) as much good Wine now ,
As would lay up a Dutch Ambassador .
If he dine there , he 's sure to have good Meat ,
For Lickfinger provides the Dinner .
Who ?
The glory o ' the Kitchin ?
that holds Cookery
A Trade from Adam ?
quotes his Broths and Sallads ?
And swears he 's not dead yet , but translated
In some immortal Crust , the Paste of Almonds ?
The same .
He holds no Man can be a Poet ,
That is not a good Cook , to know the Palats ,
And several tastes o ' the time .
He draws all Arts
Out of the Kitchin , but the Art of Poetry ,
Which he concludes the same with Cookery .
Tut , he maintains more Heresis than that .
He 'll draw the Magisterium from a Minc 'd-pye ,
And prefer Jellies , to your Julips , Doctor .
I was at an Olla Podrida of his making ,
Was a brave piece of Cookery ! at a Funeral !
But opening the Pot-lid , he made us laugh ,
Who ' had wept all Day ! and sent us such a tickling
Into our Nostrils , as the Funeral Feast
Had bin a Wedding-dinner .
Gi' him allowance ,
And that but moderate , he will make a Syren
Sing i' the Kettle , send in an Arion ,
In a brave Broth , and of a watry Green ,
Just the Sea-colour , mounted on the back
Of a grown Cunger , but in such a posture ,
As all the World would take him for a Dolphin .
He 's a rare Fellow , without question ! but
He holds some Paradoxes .
I , and Pseudodoxes .
Marry , for most , he 's Orthodox i' the Kitchin .
And knows the Clergies taste !
I , and the Laieties !
You think not o ' your time , we 'll come too late ,
If we go not presently .
Away then .
Sirs ,
You must get o ' this News , to store your Office ,
Who dines and sups i' the Town ?
where , and with whom ?
' Twill be beneficial : when you are stor 'd ,
And as we like our fare , we shall reward you .
A hungry Trade , 'twill be .
Much like D.
Humphries ,
But , now and then , as th ' holesome Proverb says ,
' Twill obsonare famem ambulando .
Shut up the Office , gentle Brother Thomas .
Brother Nathaniel , I ha' the Wine for you .
I hope to see us , one day , Emissaries .
Why not ?
' Slid , I despair not to be Master !
HOw now ?
I think I was born under Hercules Star !
Nothing but trouble and tumult to oppress me ?
Why come you back ?
where is your charge ?
I ha' brought
A gentleman to speak with you .
To speak with me ?
You know 'tis death for me to speak with any Man .
What is he ?
set me a Chair .
He 's the Master
Of the great Office .
What ?
The Staple of News ,
A mighty thing , they talk Six thousand a year .
Well , bring your six in .
Where ha' you left
Pecunia ?
Sir , in Apollo , they are scarce set .
Bring six .
Here is the Gentleman .
He must pardon me ,
I cannot rise , a diseas 'd Man .
By no means , Sir ,
Respect your Health and Ease .
It is no pride in me !
But pain , pain ; what 's your Errand , Sir , to me ?
Broker , return to your Charge , be Argus-eyed ,
Awake , to the affair you have in hand ,
Serve in Apollo , but take heed of Bacchus .
Go on , Sir . Cym .
I am come to speak with you .
' Tis pain for me to speak , a very death ,
But I will hear you ! Cym .
Sir , you have a Lady ,
That sojourns with you .
Ha ?
I am somewhat short
In my sense too ?
O'that side ,
Very imperfect , on ?
Whom I would draw
Oftner to a poor Office , I am Master of ?
My Hearing is very dead , you must speak quicker .
Or , if it please you , Sir , to let her sojourn
In part with me ; I have a moiety ,
We will divide , half of the profits .
Ha ?
I hear you better now , how come they in ?
Is it a certain business , or a casual ?
For I am loth to seek out doubtful courses ,
Run any hazardous Paths , I love strait Ways ,
A just and upright Man ! now all Trade totters .
The Trade of Mony is fal 'n two i' the Hundred .
That was a certain Trade , while th ' Age was thrifty ,
And Men good Husbands , look 'd unto their Stocks ,
Had their Minds bounded ; now the publick Riot
Prostitutes all , scatters away in Coaches ,
In
In foot-mens Coats , and waiting Womens Gowns ,
They must have Velvet Hanches ( with a Pox )
Now taken up , and yet not pay the Use ;
Bate of the Use ?
I am mad with this times manners .
You said e 'en now , it was death for you to speak .
I , but an anger , a just anger , ( as this is )
Puts life in Man .
Who can endure to see
The fury of Mens Gullets , and their Groins ?
What Fires , what Cooks , what Kitchens might be spar 'd ?
What Stews , Ponds , Parks , Coups , Garners , Magazines ?
What Velvets , Tissues , Scarfs , Embroyderies ,
And Laces they might lack ?
They covet things ?
Superfluous still ; when it were much more honour
They could want necessary ! What need hath Nature
Of Silver Dishes ?
or Gold Chamber-pots ?
Of perfum 'd Napkins ?
or a numerous Family ,
To see her eat ?
Poor , and wise she , requires
Meat only ; Hunger is not ambitious :
Say , that you were the Emperor of Pleasures ,
The great Dictator of Fashions , for all Europe ,
And had the Pomp of all the Courts , and Kingdoms ,
Laid forth unto the shew ?
to make your self
Gaz 'd , and admir 'd at ?
You must go to Bed ,
And take your natural rest : then , all this vanisheth .
Your Bravery was but shown ; 'twas not possest :
While it did boast it self , it was then perishing .
This Man has healthful Lungs .
All that excess
Appear 'd as little yours , as the Spectators .
It scarce fills up the expectation
Of a few Hours , that entertains Mens lives .
He has the monopoly of sole-speaking .
Why , good Sir ?
you talk all .
Why should I not ?
Is it not under mine own Roof ?
my Ceiling ?
But I came here to talk with you .
Why , an' I will not
Talk with you , Sir ?
you are answer 'd ; who sent for you ?
No body sent for me ?
But you came ; why then
Go as you came , here 's no Man holds you ; There ,
There lies your way , you see the Door .
This 's strange !
' Tis my civility , when I do not rellish
The Party , or his business .
Pray you be gone , Sir .
I 'll ha' no venter in your Ship , the Office
Your Bark of Six , if 'twere sixteen , good , Sir .
You are a Rogue .
I think I am Sir , truly .
A Rascal , and a Mony-bawd .
My Sirnames :
A wretched Rascal !
You will overflow ?
And spill all .
Caterpiller , Moath ,
Horse-leach , and Dung-worm ?
Still you lose your labour .
I am a broken Vessel , all runs out :
A shrunk old Dryfat .
Fare you well , good Six .
In Silver-street , the Region of Money , a good seat
for an Usurer .
He has rich ingredients in him , I warrant you , if
they were extracted , a true receit to make an Alderman , an'
he were well wrought upon , according to Art .
I would fain see an Alderman in chimia ! that is
a Treatise of Aldermanity truly written .
To shew how much it differs from Urbanity .
I , or Humanity .
Either would appear in this
Peni-boy , an' he were rightly distill 'd .
But how like you the
News ?
you are gone from that .
O , they are monstrous ! scurvy ! and stale ! and too
exotick ! ill cook 'd ! and ill dish 'd !
They were as good , yet , as Butter could make
them !
In a word , they were beastly buttered ! she shall never
come o ' my Bread more , nor in my Mouth , if I can help it .
Ihave better News from the Bake-house , by ten thousand parts ,
in a morning : or the Conduits in Westminster ! all the News
of Tuttle-street , and both the Alm 'ries ! the two Sanctua -
ries ! long and round Wool-staple ! with King 's-street , and
Cannon-row to boot !
I , my Gossip Tattle knew what fine slips grew in
Gardiners-lane ; who kist the Butchers Wife with the Cows -
breath ; what Matches were made in the Bowling-Alley , and
what Bets won and lost ; how much Grist went to the Mill ,
and what besides : who conjur 'd in Tuttle-fields , and how
many ?
when they never came there .
And which Boy rode
upon Doctor Lamb , in the likeness of a roaring Lyon ,
that run away with him in his Teeth , and ha 's not de-
vour 'd him yet .
Why , I had it from my maid Joan Hear-say : and
she had it from a Limb o ' the School , she says , a little Limb
of nine year old ; who told her , the Master left out his Con-
juring-Book one day , and he found it , and so the Fable came
But whether it were true , or no , we Gossips are bound
to believe it , an't be once out , and a foot : how should we en-
tertain the time else , or find our selves in fashionable discourse ,
for all Companies , if we do not credit all , and make more of it ,
in the reporting ?
For my part , I believe it : and there were no wiser
than I , I would have ne 'er a cunning School-Master in Eng-
I mean a Cunning-Man , a School-Master ; that is
a Conjurer , or a Poet , or that had any acquaintance with a
They make all their Scholars Play-boys ! Is't not a
fine sight , to see all our Children made Enterluders ?
Do we
pay our Money for this ?
we send them to learn their Gram -
mar , and their Terence , and they learn their Play-books ?
well , they talk , we shall have no more Parliaments ( God bless
us ) but an' we have , I hope , Zeal-of-the-land Buzy , and
my Gossip , Rabby Trouble-truth will start up , and see we
shall have painful good Ministers to keep School , and Cate-
chise our youth , and not teach 'em to speak Plays , and act Fa -
bles of false News , in this manner , to the super-vexation of
Town and Country , with a Wanion .
COme , Gentlemen , let 's breath from Healths a while .
This Lickfinger has made us a good Dinner ,
For our Pecunia : what shall 's do with our selves ,
While the Women water ?
and the Fidlers eat ?
Let 's jeer a little .
Jeer ?
what 's that ?
Expect , Sir .
We first begin with our selves , and then at you ,
A Game we use .
We jeer all kind of Persons
We meet withal , of any Rank or Quality ,
And if we cannot jeer them , we jeer our selves .
a pretty sweet Society ! and a grateful !
'Pray let 's see some .
Have at you then , Lawyer .
They say , there was one of your Coat in Bet 'lem , lately ,
I wonder all his Clients were not there .
They were the madder sort .
Except , Sir , one
Like you , and he made Verses .
Madrigal ,
A jeer .
I know .
But
But what did you do , Lawyer ,
When you made Love to Mistris Band , at Dinner ?
Why ?
of an Advocate , he grew the Clyent .
Well play 'd , my Poet .
And shew 'd the Law of Nature
Was there above the Common-Law .
Quit , quit .
Call you this jeering ?
I can play at this ,
' Tis like a Ball at Tennis .
Very like ,
But we were not well in .
' Tis indeed , Sir .
When we do speak at volley , all the ill
We can one of another .
As this morning ,
( I would you had heard us ) of the Rogue your Uncle .
That Mony-bawd .
We call 'd him a Coat-card
O' the last order .
What 's that ?
a Knave ?
Some readings have it so , my manuscript
Doth speak it , Varlet .
And your self a Fool
O' the first Rank , and one shall have the leading
O' the Right-hand File , under this brave Commander .
What saist thou , Canter ?
Sir , I say this is
A very wholsom exercise , and comely .
Like Lepers , shewing one another their Scabs ,
Or Flies feeding on Ulcers .
What News Gentlemen ?
Ha' you any News for after Dinner ?
methinks
We should not spend our time unprofitably .
They never lye , Sir , between Meals , 'gainst Supper
You may have a Bale or two brought in .
This Canter .
Is an old envious Knave ! Alm .
A very Rascal !
I ha' mark 'd him all this Meal , he has done nothing
But mock , with scurvy Faces , all we said .
A supercilious Rogue ! he looks as if
He were the Patrico ?
Or Arch-priest o ' Canters .
He 's some primate metropolitan Rascal ,
Our Shot-clog makes so much of him .
The Law ,
And he does govern him .
What say you , Gentlemen ?
We say , we wonder not , your Man o ' Law
Should be so gracious wi' you ; but how it comes ,
This Rogue , this Canter !
O , good words .
A Fellow
That speaks no Language ?
But what gingling Gipsies
And Pedlers trade in ?
And no honest Christian
Can understand ?
Why ?
by that argument ,
You all are Canters , you , and you , and you ,
All the whole World are Canters , I will prove it
In your professions .
I would fain hear this :
But stay , my Princess comes , provide the while ,
I 'll call for't anon .
How fares your Grace ?
IHope the fare was good .
Yes , Lickfinger ,
And we shall thank you for't , and reward you .
Nay , I 'll not lose my argument , Lickfinger ;
an Argument .
Before these Gentlemen , I affirm ,
The perfect , and true strain of Poetry ,
Is rather to be given the quick Celler ,
Than the fat Kitchen .
Heretick , I see
Thou art for the vain Oracle of the Bottle .
The Hogshead , Trismegistus is thy Pegasus .
Thence flows thy Muses Spring , from that hard Hoof :
Seduced Poet , I do say to thee ,
A Boyler , Range , and Dresser were the Fountains
Of all the Knowledge in the Universe .
And they 'are the Kitchens , where the Master-Cook ?
( Thou dost not know the Man , nor canst thou know him ,
Till thou hast serv 'd some years in that deep School ,
That 's both the Nurse and Mother of the Arts ,
And hear 'st him read , interpret , and demonstrate ! )
A Master-Cook ! Why , he 's the Man o ' Men ,
For a Professor ! he Designs , he Draws ,
He Paints , he Carves , he Builds , he Fortifies ,
Makes Citadels of curious Fowl and Fish ,
Some he dri-dishes , some motes round with Broths .
Mounts Marrow-bones , cuts fifty angled Custards ,
Rears Bulwark Pies , and for his outer works
He raiseth Ramparts of immortal Crust ;
And teacheth all the Tacticks , at one Dinner :
What Ranks , what Files , to put his Dishes in ;
The whole Art Military .
Then he knows
The influence of the Stars upon his Meats ,
And all their Seasons , Tempers , Qualities ,
And so to fit his Relishes , and Sauces ,
He has Nature in a Pot , 'bove all the Chymists ,
Or airy Brethren of the Rosie-cross .
He is an Architect , an Ingineer ,
A Soldier , a Physician , a Philosopher ,
A general Mathematician .
It is granted .
And that you may not doubt him for a Poet ?
This fury shews , if there were nothing else !
And 'tis Divine ! I shall for ever hereafter ,
Admire the wisdom of a Cook ! Ban .
And we , Sir !
O , how my Princess draws me with her looks ,
And hales me in , as Eddies draw in Boats ,
Or strong Charybdis Ships , that sail too near
The Shelves of Love ! The Tides of your two Eyes !
Wind of your Breath , are such as suck in all
That do approach you !
Who hath chang 'd my servant ?
Your self , who drink my Blood up with your Beams ;
As doth the Sun , the Sea ! Pecunia shines
More in the World than he : and makes it Spring
Where e 'er she favours ! 'please her but to show
Her melting Wrists , or bare her Ivory Hands ,
She catches still ! her Smiles they are Love 's Fetters !
Her Breasts his Apples ! her Teats Strawberries !
Where Cupid ( were he present now ) would cry ,
Fare well my Mothers Milk , here 's sweeter Nectar !
Help me to praise Pecunia , Gentlemen :
She 's your Princess , lend your wits .
A Lady
The Graces taught to move ! Alm .
The Hours did nurse .
Whose Lips are the instructions of all Lovers !
Her Eyes their lights , and rivals to the Stars !
A Voice , as if that Harmony still spake !
And polish 'd Skin , whiter than Venus Foot !
Young Hebes Neck , or Juno 's Arms !
A Hair ,
Large as the Mornings , and her Breath as sweet
As Meddows after Rain , and but new mown !
L?da might yield unto her , for a Face !
Hermione for Breasts ! Fit .
Flora , for Cheeks !
And Helen for a Mouth !
Kiss , kiss 'em , Princess .
The Pearl doth strive in whiteness with her Neck ,
But loseth by it : here the Snow thaws Snow ;
One frost resolves another ! Fit .
O , she has
A Front too slippery to be look't upon !
And glances that beguile the seer 's Eyes !
Kiss , kiss again ; what says my Man o ' War ?
I say , she 's more than Fame can promise of her .
A Theme that 's overcome with her own matter !
Praise is struck blind , and deaf , and dumb with her !
She doth astonish Commendation !
Well pumpt i' faith old Sailor : kiss him too ,
Though he be a slug.
What says my Poet-sucker ?
He 's chewing his Muses cud , I do see by him .
I have almost done , I want but e 'en to finish .
That 's the 'ill luck of all his works still .
What ?
To begin many works , but finish none ;
How does he do his Mistris work ?
I cannot think he finisheth that .
Let 's hear .
It is a Madrigal , I affect that kind
Of Poem , much .
And thence you ha' the name .
It is his Rose .
He can make nothing else .
I made it to the Tune the Fidlers play 'd ,
That we all lik 'd so well .
Good , read it , read it .
The Sun is Father of all Mettals , you know ,
Silver , and Gold .
I , leave your Prologues , say !
S O N G.
AS bright as is the Sun her Sire ,
Or Earth her Mother , in her best Attire ,
Or Mint , the Mid-wife , with her fire ,
{ P.
That Mint
the Midwife does
Comes forth her Grace !
The splendour of the wealthiest
Mines !
The stamp , and strength of all imperial
lines ,
{ Fit .
That 's fairly
said of Money .
Both Majesty and Beauty shines ,
In her sweet Face !
Look how a Torch , of Taper light ,
Good !
Or of that Torches flame , a Beacon bright ;
Now there , I want a Line to finish , Sir .
Or of that Beacons fire , Moon-light :
' Tis good .
So takes she place !
And then I 'have a Saraband ? ?
She makes good Chear , she keeps full Boards ,
She holds a Fair of Knights and Lords ,
A Market of all Offices ,
And Shops of Honour , more or less .
According to Pecunia 's Grace ,
The Bride hath Beauty , Blood , and Place ;
The Bridegroom Vertue , Valour , Wit ,
And Wisdom , as he stands for it .
Call in the Fidlers .
Nick , the Boy shall sing it ,
Sweet Princess , kiss him , kiss 'em all , dear Madam ,
And at the close , vouchsafe to call them Cousins .
Sweet Cousin Madrigal , and Cousin Fitton ,
My Cousin Shunfield , and my learned Cousin .
Al-manach , though they call him Almanack .
Why , here 's the Prodigal prostitutes his Mistris !
And Picklock , he must be a Kinsman too .
My Man o ' Law will teach us all to win ,
And keep our own .
Old Founder .
Nothing , I Sir ?
I am a Wretch , a Begger .
She the fortunate ,
Can want no Kindred ; we the poor know none .
Nor none shall know , by my consent .
Nor mine .
Sing , Boy , stand here .
Look , look , how all their Eyes
Dance i' their Heads ( observe ) scatter 'd with Lust !
At sight o ' their brave Idol ! how they are tickl 'd ,
With a light Air ! the bawdy Saraband !
They are a kind of dancing Engines all !
And set by Nature , thus to run alone
To every sound ! All things within , without them ,
Move , but their Brain , and that stands still ! mere Monsters
Here , in a Chamber , of most subtil Feet !
And make their Legs in tune , passing the Streets !
These are the gallant Spirits o ' the Age !
The Miracles o ' the time ! that can cry up
And down Mens Wits ! and set what rate on things
Their half-brain 'd Fancies please ! Now Pox upon 'em .
See how solicitously he learns the Jigg ,
As if it were a Mystery of his Faith !
A dainty ditty ! Fit .
O , he 's a dainty Poet !
When he sets to't ! P.
And a dainty Scholar !
No, no great Scholar , he writes like a Gentleman .
Pox o ' your Scholar .
Pox o ' your distinction !
As if a Scholar were no Gentleman .
With these , to write like a Gentleman , will in time
Become , all one , as to write like an Ass .
These Gentlemen ?
these Rascals ! I am sick
Of indignation at 'em .
How do you lik't , Sir ?
' Tis excellent ! Alm .
' Twas excellently sung !
A dainty Air ! P.
What says my Lickfinger ?
I am telling Mistris Band , and Mistris Statute ,
What a brave Gentleman you are , and Wax , here !
How much 'twere better , that my Ladies Grace ,
Would here take up Sir , and keep House with you .
What say they ?
We could consent , Sir , willingly .
I , if we knew her Grace had the least liking .
We must obey her Graces will and pleasure .
I thank you , Gentlewoman , ply 'em , Lickfinger .
Give Mother Mortgage , there ? ? ?
Her dose of Sack .
I have it for her , and her distance of Hum .
Indeed therein , I must confess , dear Cousin ,
I am a most unfortunate Princess .
And
You still will be so , when your Grace may help it .
Who 'ld lie in a Room , with a Close-stool , and
Garlick ,
And kennel with his Dogs , that had a Prince
Like this young Peni-boy , to sojourn with ?
He 'll let you ha' your liberty ?
Go forth ,
Whither you please , and to what Company ?
Scatter your self amongst us ?
Hope of Pernassus !
Thy Ivy shall not wither , nor thy Bays ,
Thou shalt be had into her Graces Cellar ,
And there know Sack , and Claret , all December ,
Thy Vein is rich , and we must cherish it .
Poets and Bees swarm now adays , but yet
There are not those good Taverns , for the one sort ,
As there are Flowry Fields to feed the other .
Though Bees be pleas 'd with Dew , ask little Wax ,
That brings the Honey to her Ladies Hive :
The Poet must have Wine .
And he shall have it .
What Broker ?
Who 's that ?
my Uncle !
I am abus 'd ; where is my Knave ?
my Broker ?
Your Broker is laid out upon a Bench , yonder ,
Sack hath seiz 'd on him , in the shape of Sleep.
He hath been dead to us almost this Hour .
This Hour ?
Why sigh you , Sir ?
'cause he 's at rest ?
It breeds my unrest .
Will you take a Cup
And try if you can sleep ?
No, cogging Jack ,
Thou and thy Cups too , perish .
O , the Sack !
The Sack , the Sack ! P.
A Madrigal on Sack !
Or rather an Elegie , for the Sack is gone .
Why do you this , Sir ?
spill the Wine , and rave ?
For Booker 's sleeping ?
What through sleep and Sack ,
My trust is wrong 'd : but I am still awake ,
To wait upon your Grace , please you to quit
This strange lew 'd Company , they are not for you .
refuseth , and her Train .
No
No, Guardian , I do like them very well .
Your Graces Pleasure be observ 'd ; but you
Statute , and Band , and Wax , will go with me ?
Truly we will not .
We will stay , and wait here
Upon her Grace , and this your Noble Kinsman .
Noble ! how Noble ! who hath made him Noble ?
Why , my most noble Money hath , or shall ;
My Princess here : She , that had you but kept ,
And treated kindly , would have made you noble ,
And wise too ; nay , perhaps have done that for you ,
Nay , say her Jayl .
Never unfortunate Princess
Was us 'd so by a Jaylor .
Ask my Women ,
Band , you can tell , and Statute , how he has us 'd me ,
Kept me close Prisoner , under twenty Bolts ? ?
And forty Padlocks ?
All malicious Engines
A wicked Smith could forge out of his Iron ;
As Locks and Keys , Shackles and Manacles ,
To torture a great Lady .
H' has abus 'd
Your Graces Body .
No, he would ha' done ,
That lay not in his power : he had the use
Of our Bodies , Band , and Wax , and sometimes Statutes :
But once he would ha' smother 'd me in a Chest ,
And strangl 'd me in Leather , but that you
Came to my rescue then , and gave me Air .
For which he cramm 'd us up in a close Box ,
All three together , where we saw no Sun
In one six Months .
A cruel Man he is !
H' has left my Fellow Wax out i' the cold ,
Till she was stiff as any Frost , and crumbl 'd
Away to Dust , and almost lost her Form .
Much ado to recover me .
Women Jeerers !
Have you learn 'd too the subtil Faculty ?
Come , I 'll shew you the way home , if Drink ,
Or too full Diet have disguis 'd you .
Troth ,
We have not any mind , Sir , of return ? ?
To be bound Back to Back ? ?
And have our Legs
Turn 'd in , or writh 'd about ?
Or else display 'd ?
Be lodg 'd with Dust and Fleas , as we were wont ?
And dieted with Dogs-dung .
Why , you Whores ,
My Bawds , my Instruments , what should I call you ,
Man may think base enough for you ?
Hear you , Uncle :
I must not hear this of my Princess Servants ,
And in Apollo , in Pecunia 's Room .
Go , get you down the Stairs ; home , to your Kennel ,
As swiftly as you can .
Consult your Dogs ,
The Lares of your Family ; or , believe it ,
The Fury of a Foot-man and a Drawer
Hangs over you .
Cudgel and Pot do threaten
A kind of Vengeance .
Barbers are at hand .
Washing and Shaving will ensue .
The Pump
Is not far off ; if 'twere , the Sink is near ,
Or a good Jordan .
You have now no Money .
But are a Rascal .
I am cheated , robb 'd ,
Jeer 'd by confederacy .
No, you are kick 'd ,
And used kindly , as you should be .
Spurn 'd
From all Commerce of Men , who are a Cur .
A stinking Dog in a Doublet , with foul Linnen .
A snarling Rascal , hence .
Well , remember ,
I am cozen 'd by my Cousin , and his Whore !
Bane o ' these Meetings in Apollo! Lic .
Go , Sir ,
You will be tost like Block , in a Blanket , else .
Down with him , Lickfinger .
Saucy Jack , away ;
Pecunia is a Whore .
Play him down , Fidlers ,
And drown his Noise .
Who 's this !
O , Master Pied-mantle !
BY your leave , Gentlemen .
Lady Pecunia her
Her Graces Herald .
No Herald yet , a Heraldet .
What 's that ?
A Canter .
O , thou saidst thou 'dst prove us all so !
Sir , here is one will prove himself so , streight ;
So shall the rest , in time .
My Pedigree ?
I tell you Friend , he must be a good Scholar
Can my Descent : I am of Princely Race ,
And as good Blood as any is i' the Mines
Runs through my Veins .
I am , every Limb , a Princess !
Dutchess o ' Mines was my great Grandmother ;
And by the Fathers side , I come from Sol
My Grandfather was Duke of Or , and match 'd
In the Blood-Royal of Ophyr .
Here 's his Coat .
I know it , if I hear the Blazon .
He bears
In a Field Azure , a Sun proper , beamy ,
Twelve of the second , P.
How far 's this from canting ?
Her Grace doth understand it .
She can cant , Sir .
What be these ?
Bezants ?
Yes , an't please your Grace .
That is our Coat too , as we come from Or .
What Line 's this ?
The rich Mines of Potosi ,
The Spanish Mines i' the West-Indies .
This ?
The Mines o ' Hungary , this of Barbary .
But this , this little Branch ?
The Welsh Mine , that .
I ha' Welsh Blood in me too ; blaze , Sir , that Coat .
She bears ( an't please you ) Argent , three Leeks vert ,
In Canton Or , and tassel 'd of the first .
Is not this Canting ?
do you understand him ?
Not I ; but it sounds well , and the whole thing
Is rarely painted : I will have such a Scroll ,
What ere it cost me .
Well , at better leasure
We 'll take a view of it , and so reward you .
Kiss him , sweet Princess , and stile him a Cousin .
I will , if you will have it .
Cousin Pyed-mantle .
I love all Men of Vertue , from my Princess ,
Unto my Begger here , old Canter ; on ,
On to thy Proof ; whom prove you the next Canter ?
The Doctor here , I will proceed with the Learned .
When he discourseth of Dissection ,
Or any Point of Anatomy ; that he tells you
Of Vena cava , and of Vena porta ,
The Meseraicks , and the Mesenterium :
What does he else but cant ?
Or if he run
To his Judicial Astrology ,
And trowl the Trine , the Quartile , and the Sextile ,
Platick Aspect , and Partile , with his Hyleg
Or Alchochoden , Cuspes , and Horoscope ;
Does not he cant ?
Who here does understand him ?
This is no Canter , though !
Or when my Muster-master
Talks of his Tacticks , and his Ranks and Files ,
His Bringers-up , his Leaders-on , and cries ,
Faces about to the Right-hand , the Left ,
Now , as you were ; then tells you of Redoubts ,
Of Cats , and Cortines .
Doth not he cant ?
Yes , faith .
My Egg-chin 'd Laureat here , when he comes forth
With Dimeters , and Trimeters , Tetrameters ,
Pentameters , Hexameters , Catalecticks ,
M m m His
His Hyper , and his Brachy-Catalecticks ,
His Pyrrhicks , Epitrites , and Choriambicks .
What is all this , but Canting ?
A rare Fellow !
Some begging Scholar !
A decay 'd Doctor at least !
Nay , I do cherish Vertue , though in Rags .
And you , Mas Courtier .
Now he treats of you ,
Stand forth to him fair .
With all your fly-blown Projects ,
And Looks out of the Politicks , your shut Faces ,
And reserv 'd Questions and Answers , that you game with ; as
Is't a clear Business ?
Will it manage well ?
My Name must not be us 'd else .
Here 'twill dash .
Your Business has receiv 'd a taint , give off ,
I may not prostitute my self .
Tut , tut ,
That little Dust I can blow off at pleasure .
Here 's no such Mountain , yet , i' the whole Work !
But a light Purse may level .
I will tide
This Affair for you ; give it freight , and passage :
And such Mint-phrase , as 'tis the worst of Canting ,
By how much it affects the Sense it has not .
This is some other than he seems !
How like you him ?
This cannot be a Canter ! P.
But he is , Sir ,
And shall be still , and so shall you be too :
We 'll all be Canters .
Now I think of it ,
A noble Whimsie 's come into my Brain !
I 'll build a Colledge , I and my Pecunia ,
And call it Canters Colledge : sounds it well ?
Excellent ! P.
And here stands my Father Rector ,
And you Professors , you shall all profess
Something , and live there , with her Grace and me ,
Your Founders : I 'll endow't with Lands and Means ,
And Lickfinger shall be my Master-Cook .
What , is he gone ?
And a Professor .
And read Apicius de re Culinaria
To your brave Doxy and you ! P.
You , Cousin Fitton ,
Shall ( as a Courtier ) read the Politicks ;
Doctor Almanack he shall read Astrology ;
Shunfield shall read the Military Arts .
As carving , and assaulting the cold Custard .
And Horace here the Art of Poetry .
His Lyricks , and his Madrigals , fine Songs ,
Which we will have at Dinner , steept in Clarret ,
And against Supper , sous 'd in Sack .
In troth ,
A divine Whimsie ! Shun .
And a worthy Work ,
Fit for a Chronicle ! P.
Is't not ?
To all Ages .
And Pied-mantle shall give us all our Arms :
But Picklock , what wouldst thou be ?
Thou canst cant too .
In all the Languages in Westminster-hall ,
Pleas , Bench , or Chancery .
Fee-farm , Fee-Tail ,
Tenant in Dower , at Will , for Term of Life ,
By Copy of Court-Roll , Knights Service , Homage ,
Fealty , Escuage , Soccage , or Frank almoigne ,
Grand Sergeanty , or Burgage .
Thou appear 'st ,
Kat exochn a Canter .
Thou shalt read
All Littleton 's Tenures to me , and indeed
All my Conveyances .
And make 'em too , Sir ?
Keep all your Courts , be Steward o ' your Lands ,
Let all your Leases , keep your Evidences :
But first , I must procure and pass your Mort-main ,
You must have Licence from above , Sir . P.
Fear not ,
Pecunia 's Friends shall do it .
But I shall stop it .
Your Worships loving and obedient Father ,
Your painful Steward , and lost Officer !
Who have done this , to try how you would use
Pecunia , when you had her : which since I see ,
I will take home the Lady to my Charge ,
And these her Servants , and leave you my Cloke ,
To travel in to Beggers Bush ! A Seat
Is built already , furnisht too , worth twenty
Of your imagin 'd Structures , Canters Colledge .
' Tis his Father ! Mad .
He 's alive , methinks .
I knew he was no Rogue !
Thou , Prodigal ,
Was I so careful for thee , to procure
And plot wi' my learn 'd Counsel , Master Picklock ,
This Noble Match for thee ?
and dost thou prostitute ,
Scatter thy Mistris Favours , throw away
Her Bounties , as they were red-burning Coals ,
Too hot for thee to handle , on such Rascals ,
Who are the Scum and Excrements of Men ?
If thou hadst sought out good and vertuous Persons
Of these Professions , I had lov 'd thee , and them :
For these shall never have that Plea 'gainst me ,
Or colour of advantage , that I hate
Their Callings , but their Manners and their Vices .
A worthy Courtier is the Ornament
Of a Kings Palace , his great Masters Honour .
This is a Moth , a Rascal , a Court-Rat ,
That gnaws the Common-wealth with broking Suits ,
And eating Grievances ! So , a true Soldier ,
He is his Countries Strength , his Sovereigns Safety ,
And to secure his Peace , he makes himself
The Heir of Danger , nay the Subject of it ,
And runs those vertuous Hazards that this Scare-crow
Cannot endure to hear of .
You are pleasant , Sir .
With you I dare be ! Here is Pied-mantle ,
' Cause he 's an Ass , do not I love a Herald ?
Who is the pure Preserver of Descents ,
The keeper fair of all Nobility ,
Without which all would run into Confusion ?
Were he a learned Herald , I would tell him
He can give Arms and Marks , he cannot Honour ,
No more than Money can make Noble : It may
Give Place , and Rank , but it can give no Vertue :
And he would thank me for this Truth .
This Dog-leach ,
You stile him Doctor , 'cause he can compile
An Almanack , perhaps erect a Scheme
For my great Madams Monkey , when't has ta'ne
A Glister , and bewray 'd the Ephemerides .
Do I despise a learn 'd Physician ,
In calling him a Quacksalver , or blast
The ever-living Ghirlond , always green
Of a good Poet ?
When I say his Wreath
Is piec'd and patch 'd of dirty wither 'd Flowers ?
Away , I am impatient of these Ulcers ,
( That I not call you worse . )
There is no Sore
Or Plague but you to infect the Times .
I abhor
Your very Scent .
Come , Lady , since my Prodigal
Knew not to entertain you to your worth ,
I 'll see if I have learn 'd how to receive you
With more respect to you , and your fair Train here .
Farewel , my Begger in Velvet , for to day ;
To morrow you may put on that grave Robe ,
And enter your great Work of Canters Colledge ,
Your Work , and worthy of a Chronicle .
strophe !
The Matter began to be good but now ; and he has
spoil 'd it all with his Begger there !
A beggerly Jack it is , I warrant him , and a kin
to the Poet .
Like enough , for he had the chiefest Part in his Play ,
if you mark it .
Absurdity on him , for a huge over-grown Play-
maker ! Why should he make him live agen , when they and
we all thought him dead ?
If he had left him to his Rags ,
there had been an end of him .
I , but set a Beggar on Horse-back , he 'll never lin till
he be a gallop .
The young Heir grew a fine Gentleman in this last
And feasted 'em , and his Mistris .
And shew 'd her to 'em all ! was not jealous !
But very communicative , and liberal , and began
to be magnificent , if the Churl his Father would have let
him alone .
It was spitefully done o ' the Poet , to make the Chuff
take him off in his height , when he was going to do all his
brave Deeds !
To found an Academy !
Erect a Colledge !
Plant his Professors , and water his Lectures !
With Wine , Gossips , as he meant to do ; and then
to defraud his Purposes ?
Kill the Hopes of so many towardly young Spirits ?
As the Doctors ?
And the Courtiers ! I protest , I was in love with
Master Fitton : He did wear all he had , from the Hat-band
to the Shoe-tie , so politically , and would stoop , and leer !
And lie so in wait for a piece of Wit , like a
Mouse-trap !
Indeed Gossip , so would the little Doctor ; all his
Behaviour was meer Glister ! O' my Conscience , he would
make any Parties Physick i' the World work , with his Di-
I wonder they would suffer it , a foolish , old , for-
nicating Father , to ravish away his Son 's Mistris .
And all her Women at once , as he did !
I would ha' flown in his Gipsies Face , i' faith .
It was a plain piece of political Incest , and wor-
thy to be brought afore the High-Commission of Wit .
Sup -
pose we were to censure him , you are the youngest Voice , Gos-
sip Tattle , begin .
Marry , I would ha' the old Coney-catcher co-
zen 'd of all he has , i' the young Heirs Defence , by his Lear-
ned Counsel , Mr. Picklock !
I would rather the Courtier had found out some
Trick to beg him for his Estate !
Or the Captain had Courage enough to beat him !
Or the fine Madrigal-man , in Ryme , to have run
him out o ' the Country , like an Irish Rat .
No, I would have Master Pyed-mantle , her Gra -
ces Herald , to pluck down his Hatchments , reverse his
Coat-Armour , and nullifie him for no Gentleman .
Nay , then let Master Doctor dissect him , have him
open 'd , and his Tripes translated to Lickfinger , to make a
Probation-dish of .
Agreed ! agreed !
Faith , I would have him flat disinherited , by a
Decree of Court , bound to make Restitution of the Lady
Pecunia , and the Use of her Body to his Son .
And her Train to the Gentlemen .
And both the Poet , and himself , to ask them all
forgiveness !
And us too .
In two large Sheets of Paper ? ? ?
Or to stand in a Skin of Parchment , ( which the
Court please . )
And those fill 'd with News !
And dedicated to the sustaining of the Staple !
Which their Poet hath let fall , most abruptly .
Bankruptly , indeed .
You say wittily , Gossip ; and therefore let a Pro-
test go out against him .
A Mournival of Protests , or a Gleek at least .
In all our Names .
For a decay 'd Wit ? ?
Broken ? ?
Non-solvent ? ?
And for ever forfeit ? ?
To scorn of Mirth !
Censure !
Expectation !
Subsign 'd , Tattle .
Stay , they come again .
NAy , they ere fit , as they had been made for me ,
And I am now a thing worth looking at !
The same I said I would be in the Morning !
No Rogue , at a Comitia of the Canters ,
Did ever there become his Parents Robes
Better than I do these .
Great Fool ! and Beggar !
Why do not all that are of those Societies
Come forth , and gratulate me one of theirs ?
Me thinks I should be on every side saluted ,
Dauphine of Beggars , Prince of Prodigals !
That have so fall 'n under the Ears , and Eyes ,
And Tongues of all , the Fable of the Time ,
Matter of Scorn , and Mark of Reprehension !
I now begin to see my Vanity
Shine in this Glass , reflected by the Foil !
Where is my Fashioner ?
my Feather-man ?
My Linnener , Perfumer , Barber ?
all
That Tail of Riot follow 'd me this Morning ?
Not one ! but a dark Solitude about me ,
Worthy my Cloak and Patches ; as I had
The epidemical Disease upon me :
And I 'll sit down with it .
My Master ! Maker !
How do you ?
Why do you sit thus o ' the ground , Sir ?
Hear you the News ?
No, nor I care to hear none .
Would I could here sit still , and slip away
The other One and twenty , to have this
Forgotten , and the Day raz 'd out , expung 'd ,
In every Ephemerides , or Almanack .
Or if it must be in , that Time and Nature
Have decreed ; still let it be a Day
Of tickling Prodigals about the Gills ,
Deluding gaping Heirs , losing their Loves ,
And their Discretions , falling from the Favours
Of their best Friends and Parent , their own Hopes ,
And entring the Society of Canters .
A doleful Day it is , and dismal Times
Are come upon us : I am clear undone .
How , Thom ?
Why , broke , broke ! wretchely broke ! P.
Ha ?
Our Staple is all to pieces , quite dissolv 'd !
Ha !
Shiver 'd , as in an Earthquake ! Heard you not
The Crack and Ruins ?
We are all blown up !
Soon as they heard th ' Infanta was got from them ,
Whom they had so devoured i' their Hopes ,
To be their Patroness , and sojourn with 'em ,
Our Emissaries , Register , Examiner ,
Flew into Vapour : our grave Governour
Into a subt 'ler Air , and is return 'd
( As we do hear ) grand Captain of the Jeerers .
I and my Fellow melted into Butter ,
And spoil ' our Ink , and so the Office vanish 'd .
The last Hum that it made , was , That your Father
And Picklock are fall 'n out , the Man o ' Law .
How ?
this awakes me from my Lethargy .
And a great Suit is like to be between 'em :
Picklock denies the Feoffment , and the Trust ,
( Your Father says ) he made of the whole Estate
Unto him , as respecting his Mortality ,
When he first laid this late Device , to try you .
Has Picklock then a Trust ?
I cannot tell ,
M m m 2 Here
Here comes the worshipful ?
VVhat , my Velvet Heir
Turn 'd Begger in Mind , as Robes ?
You see what case
Your , and my Fathers Plots have brought me to .
Your Father 's , you may say , indeed , not mine .
He 's a hard-hearted Gentleman ! I am sorry
To see his rigid Resolution !
That any Man should so put off Affection ,
And humane Nature , to destroy his own ,
And triumph in a Victory so cruel !
He 's fall 'n out with me , for being yours ,
And calls me Knave , and Traytor to his Trust ,
Says he will have me thrown over the Bar ? ?
Ha' you deserv 'd it ?
O , good Heaven knows
My Conscience , and the silly Latitude of it ;
A narrow-minded Man ! My Thoughts do dwell
All in a Lane , or Line indeed : No Turning ,
Nor scarce Obliquity in them .
I still look
Right forward , to th ' Intent and Scope of that
VVhich he would go from now .
Had you a Trust then ?
Sir , I had somewhat will keep you still Lord
Of all the Estate , ( if I be honest ) as
I hope I shall .
My tender scrupulous Breast
VVill not permit me see the Heir defrauded ,
And like an Alien thrust out of the Blood .
The Laws forbid that I should give consent
To such a civil Slaughter of a Son .
Where is the Deed ?
Hast thou it with thee ?
No,
It is a thing of greater consequence ,
Than to be born about in a Black Box ,
Like a Low-Country Vorloffe or Welsh Brief .
It is at Lickfingers , under Lock and Key .
O , fetch it hither .
I have bid him bring it ,
That you might see it .
Knows he what he brings ?
No more than a Gardiners Ass , what Roots he carries .
I was a sending my Father , like an Ass ,
A penitent Epistle ; but I am glad
I did not , now .
Hang him , an austere Grape ,
That has no Juice , but what is Verjuice in him .
to fetch his Letter .
I 'll shew you my Letter !
Shew me a Defiance !
If I can now commit Father and Son ,
And make my Profits out of both ; commence
A Suit with the Old Man for his whole State ,
And go to Law with the Son 's Credit , undo
Both , both with their own Money , it were a piece
Worthy my Night-cap , and the Gown I wear ,
A Picklock 's Name in Law .
Where are you , Sir ?
What do you do so long ?
I cannot find
Where I have laid it ; but I have laid it safe .
No matter , Sir ; trust you unto my Trust ,
' Tis that that shall secure you , an absolute Deed !
And I confess , it was in Trust , for you ,
Lest any thing might have hapned mortal to him :
But there must be a Gratitude thought on ,
And Aid , Sir , for the Charges of the Suit ,
Which will be great , 'gainst such a mighty Man
As is our Father , and a Man possest
Of so much Land , Pecunia and her Friends .
I am not able to wage Law with him ,
Yet must maintain the thing , as my own Right ,
Still for your good , and therefore must be bold
To use your Credit for Moneys .
What thou wilt ,
So we be safe , and the Trust bear it .
Fear not ,
' Tis he must pay Arrearages in the end .
We 'll milk him , and Pecunia , draw their Cream down ,
Before he get the Deed into his Hands .
My Name is Picklock , but he 'll find me a Padlock .
conferring wi' your Learned Counsel
Upo ' the Cheat ?
Are you o ' the Plot to cozen me ?
What Plot ?
Your Counsel knows there , Mr. Picklock .
Will you restore the Trust yet ?
Sir , take Patience ,
And Memory unto you , and bethink you ,
What Trust ?
where dos't appear ?
I have your Deed :
Doth your Deed specifie any Trust ?
Is't not
But what Conference ,
What Oaths and Vows preceded ?
I will tell you , Sir ,
Since I am urg 'd of those , as I remember ,
You told me you had got a grown Estate ,
By griping Means , sinisterly .
How ! ) Pic .
And were
Ev'n weary of it ; if the Parties lived ,
From whom you had wrested it ?
Ha ! ) Pic .
You could be glad
To part with all , for satisfaction :
But since they had yielded to Humanity ,
And that just Heaven had sent you for a Punishment
( You did acknowledge it ) this riotous Heir ,
That would bring all to Beggery in the end ,
And daily sow 'd Consumption where he went ? ?
You 'ld cozen both then ?
your Confederate too ?
After a long , mature deliberation ,
You could not think where better how to place it ? ?
Than on you , Rascal ?
What you please i' your Passion ;
But with your Reason , you will come about ,
And think a faithful and a frugal Friend
To be preferr 'd .
Before a Son ?
A Prodigal ,
A Tub without a Bottom , as you term 'd him :
For which , I might return you a Vow or two ,
And seal it with an Oath of Thankfulness ,
I not repent it , neither have I cause , yet ? ?
Forehead of Steel , and Mouth of Brass ! hath
Impudence
Polish 'd so gross a Lie , and dar 'st thou vent it ?
Engine , compos 'd of all mixt Metals ! Hence ,
I will not change a Syllab with thee more ,
Till I may meet thee at a Bar in Court ,
Before thy Judges .
Thither it must come .
Before I part with it to you , or you , Sir .
I will not hear thee .
Sir , your Ear to me tho .
Not that I see through his perplexed Plots ,
And hidden Ends ; nor that my Parts depend
Upon the unwinding this so knotted Skean ,
Do I beseech your Patience .
Unto me
He hath confest the Trust .
How ?
I confess it ?
I , thou , false Man .
Stand up to him , and confront him .
Where ?
when ?
to whom ?
To me , even now , and here :
Canst thou deny it ?
Can I eat or drink ?
Sleep , wake , or dream ?
arise , sit , go , or stand ?
Do any thing that 's natural ?
Yes , lie ,
It seems thou canst , and perjure ; that is natural .
O me ! what Times are these , of frontless carriage !
An Egg of the same Nest ! the Father 's Bird !
It runs in a Blood , I see ! P.
I 'll stop your Mouth .
With what ?
With Truth .
With Noise ; I must have Witness .
Where is your Witness ?
you can produce Witness .
As
As if my Testimony were not twenty ,
Balanc 'd with thine ?
So say all Prodigals ,
Sick of Self-love ; but that 's not Law , young Scatter-good :
I live by Law .
Why , if thou hast a Conscience ,
That is a thousand Witnesses .
No Court
Grants out a Writ of Summons for the Conscience ,
That I know , nor Subp ?na ,
nor Attachment .
I must have Witness , and of your producing ,
Ere this can come to hearing , and it must
Be heard on Oath and Witness .
Come forth , Thom ,
Speak what thou heard 'st , the truth , and the whole truth ,
And nothing but the truth .
What said this Varlet ?
A Rat behind the Hangings ! Tho .
Sir , he said ,
And , like an Alien , thrust out of the Blood .
The Laws forbid that he should give consent
To such a Civil Slaughter of a Son ?
And talk 'd of a Gratuity to be given ,
And Aid unto the Charges of the Suit ;
Which he was to maintain in his own Name ,
But for my Use , he said .
It is enough .
And he would milk Pecunia , and draw down
Her Cream , before you got the Trust again .
Your Ears are in my Pocket , Knave , go shake 'em
The little while you have them .
You do trust
To your great Purse .
I ha' you in a Purse-net ,
Good Master Picklock , wi' your worming Brain ,
And wrigling Ingine-head of Maintenance ,
Which I shall see you hole with , very shortly .
A fine round Head , when those two Lugs are off ,
To trundle through a Pillory .
You are sure
You heard him speak this ?
I , and more .
Much more !
I 'll prove yours Maintenance , and Combination ,
And sue you all .
Do , do , my gowned Vulture ,
Crop in Reversion : I shall see you coited
Over the Bar , as Barge-men do their Billets .
This 'tis , when Men repent of their good Deeds ,
And would ha 'em in again ?
They are almost mad !
But I forgive their Lucida Intervalla .
O , Lickfinger ! come hither .
Where 's my Writing ?
aside for the Writing .
ISent it you , together with your Keys ,
How ?
By the Porter that came for it , from you ,
And by the token , you had giv'n me the Keys ,
And bad me bring it .
And why did you not ?
Why did you send a Countermand ?
Who , I ?
You , or some other you , you put in trust .
In trust ?
Your Trust 's another self , you know ;
And without Trust , and your Trust , how should he
Take notice of your Keys , or of my Charge ?
Know you the Man ?
I know he was a Porter ,
And a Seal 'd Porter ; for he bore the Badge
On Breast , I am sure .
I am lost ! a Plot ! I scent it !
Why ! and I sent it by the Man you sent ,
Whom else I had not trusted .
Plague o ' your Trust ,
I am truss 'd up among you .
Or you may be .
In mine own Halter , I have made the Noose .
What was it , Lickfinger ?
Plot of sending for it by the Porter , and that he
is in possession of the Deed .
A Writing , Sir ,
He sent for't by a Token : I was bringing it ,
But that he sent a Porter , and he seem 'd
A Man of decent Carriage .
' Twas good fortune !
To cheat the Cheater , was no Cheat , but Justice .
Put off your Rags , and be your self again :
Makes that suspected oft , we would persuade .
Hear you the News ?
The Office is down , how should we ?
But of your Uncle ?
He 's run mad , Sir .
How , Lickfinger ?
Stark staring mad , your Brother ,
H' has almost kill 'd his Maid .
Now Heaven forbid .
But that she 's Cat-liv 'd , and Squirrel-limb 'd ,
With throwing Bed-staves at her : H' has set wide
His outer Doors , and now keeps open House
For all the Passers by to see his Justice .
First , he has apprehended his two Dogs ,
As being o ' the Plot to cozen him ;
And there he sits like an old Worm of the Peace ,
Wrapp 'd up in Furs , at a square Table , screwing ,
Examining , and committing the poor Curs
To two old Cases of Close-stools , as Prisons ;
The one of which he calls his Lollards Tower ,
Th' other his Block-house , 'cause his two Dogs Names
Are Block and Lollard .
This would be brave Matter
Unto the Jeerers .
I , if so the Subject
Were not so wretched .
Sure I met them all ,
I think , upon that quest .
' Faith , like enough :
The Vicious still are swift to shew their Natures .
I 'll thither too , but with another aim ,
If all succeed well , and my Simples take .
WHere are the Prisoners ?
They are forth-coming , Sir ,
Or coming forth at least .
The Rogue is drunk ,
Since I committed them to his charge .
Come hither ,
Near me , yet nearer ; breathe upon me .
Wine !
Wine , o ' my Worship ! Sack ! Canary Sack !
Could not your Badge ha' been drunk with fulsom Ale ,
Or Beer , the Porter 's Element ?
but Sack !
I am not drunk ; we had , Sir , but one Pint ,
An honest Carrier and my self .
Who paid for't ?
Sir , I did give it him .
What ?
and spend Six-pence !
A Frock spend Six-pence ! Six-pence !
Once in a Year , Sir .
In seven Years , Varlet ! Know 'st thou what
thou hast done ?
What a consumption thou hast made of a State ?
It might please Heaven , ( a lusty Knave , and young )
To let thee live some seventy Years longer ,
Till thou art fourscore and ten , perhaps a hundred .
Say seventy Years ; how many times seven in seventy ?
Why seven times ten is ten times seven , mark me ,
I will demonstrate to thee on my Fingers .
Six-pence in seven Year , ( Use upon Use )
Grows in that first seven Year to be a Twelve-pence ;
That , in the next , Two shillings ; the third , Four shillings ;
The fourth seven Year , Eight shillings ; the fifth , Sixteen ;
The sixth , Two and thirty ; the seventh , Three pound four ;
The eighth , Six pound and eight ; the ninth , Twelve pound sixteen ;
And the tenth seven , Five and twenty pound
Twelve
Twelve shillings .
This thou art fall 'n from , by thy Riot !
Should 'st thou live seventy Years , by spending Six-pence
Once i' the seven : But in a Day to waste it !
There is a Sum that Number cannot reach !
Out o ' my House , thou Pest o ' Prodigality !
Seed o ' Consumption ! Hence : A wicked Keeper
Is oft worse than the Prisoners .
There 's thy Penny ,
Four Tokens for thee .
Out , away .
My Dogs
May yet be innocent , and honest .
If not ,
I have an entrapping Question or two more ,
To put unto 'em , a cross Interrogatory ,
And I shall catch 'em .
Lollard ?
Peace :
What Whispering was that you had with Mortgage ,
When you last lick 'd her Feet ?
The truth now .
Ha ?
Did you smell she was going ?
Put down that .
And not ,
Not to return ?
You are silent ?
And when
Leap 'd you on Statute ?
As she went forth ?
There was Consent , as she was going forth .
' Twould have been fitter at her coming home ,
But you knew that she would not ?
To your Tower :
You are cunning , are you ?
I will meet your Craft .
Block , shew your Face , leave your Garesses , tell me ,
And tell me truly , what Affronts do you know
Were done Pecunia , that she left my House ?
None , say you so ?
not that you know ?
or will know ?
I fear me , I shall find you an obstinate Cur .
Why did your fellow Lollard cry this morning ?
' Cause Broker kickt him ?
Why did Broker kick him ?
Because he pist against my Ladies Gown ?
Why , that was was no affront ?
no ?
no distaste ?
You knew o ' none .
Yo'are a dissembling Tyke ,
To your Hole again , your Block-house .
Lollard , arise ,
Where did you lift your Leg up last ?
'gainst what ?
Are you struck Dummerer now , and whine for Mercy ?
Whose Kirtle was't you gnaw 'd too ?
Mistris Band 's ?
And Wax 's Stockins ?
Who did ?
Block bescumber
Statute 's white Suit , wi' the Parchment Lace there ?
And Broker 's Sattin Doublet ?
All will out .
They had offence , offence enough to quit me .
Appear Block : Fough ! 'tis manifest ; he shews it ,
Should he forswear't , make all the Affidavits
Against it , that he could afore the Bench ,
And twenty Juries , he would be convinc 'd .
He bears an Air about him doth confess it .
To Prison again , close Prison .
Not you , Lollard ;
You may enjoy the liberty o ' the House :
And yet there is a Quirk come in my Head ,
For which I must commit you too , and close .
Do not repine , it will be better for you .
Peni-boy sen .
THis is enough to make the Dogs mad too :
Let 's in upon him .
How now ?
what 's the matter ?
Come you to force the Prisoners ?
make a Rescue ?
We come to bail your Dogs .
They are not bailable ,
They stand committed without Bail or Mainprise ,
Your Bail cannot be taken .
Then the truth is ,
We come to vex you .
Jeer you .
Bate you rather .
A baited Usurer will be good Flesh .
And tender , we are told .
Who is the Butcher ,
Amongst you , that is come to cut my Throat ?
You would die a Calves death fain ; but 'tis an Oxes ,
Is meant you .
To be fairly knock 'd o ' the Head .
With a good Jeer or two .
And from your Jaw-bone ,
Don Assinigo ?
Shunfield , a Jeer , you have it .
I do confess , a washing Blow ; but Snarl ,
You that might play the third Dog , for your Teeth ,
You ha' no Money now ?
No, nor no Mortgage .
Nor Band .
Nor Statute .
No, nor blushet Wax .
Nor you no Office , as I take it .
Cymbal ,
A mighty Jeer .
Pox o ' these true Jests , I say .
He will turn the better Jeerer .
Let 's upon him ,
And if we cannot jeer him down in Wit ? ?
Let 's do 't in Noise .
Charge , Man o ' War ,
Lay him aboard .
We 'll gi' him a Broad-side first .
Where 's your Venison now ?
Your Red-deer Pies ?
Wi' your bak 'd Turkeys ?
And your Partridges ?
Your Pheasants , and fat Swans ?
Like you , turn 'd Geese .
But such as will not keep your Capitol .
You were wont to ha' your Breams ? ?
And Trouts sent in ?
Fat Carps and Salmons ?
I , and now and then
An Emblem o ' your self , an o 're grown Pike ?
You are a Jack , Sir . Fit .
You ha' made a shift
To swallow twenty such poor Jacks ere now .
If he should come to feed upon poor John ?
Or turn pure Jack-a-lent after all this ?
Tut , he 'll live like a Grasshopper ?
On Dew .
Or like a Bear , with licking his own Claws .
I , if his Dogs were away .
He 'll eat them first ,
While they are fat .
Faith , and when they are gone ,
Here 's nothing to be seen beyond .
Except
His Kindred , Spiders , Natives o ' the Soil .
Dust , he will ha' enough , to breed Fleas .
But by that time he 'll ha' no Blood to rear 'em .
He will be as thin as a Lantern , we shall see
thorow him .
And his Gut Colon tell his Intestina ? ?
Rogues , Rascals , ( Baw , waw . )
He calls his Dogs to his aid .
O ! they but rise at mention of his Tripes .
Let them alone , they do it not for him .
They bark se defendendo .
Or for custom ,
As commonly Curs do one for another .
Arm , arm you , Gentlemen Jeerers , th ' old Canter
Is coming in upon you , with his Forces ,
The Gentleman that was the Canter .
What is he ?
Stay not to ask Questions .
He 's a Flame .
A Furnace .
A Consumption ,
Kills where he goes .
See ! the whole Covey is scatter 'd ;
' Ware , 'ware the Hawks .
I love to see him fly .
What your Companions were , a poor , afrighted ,
And guilty Race of Men , that dare to stand
No Breath of Truth ; but conscious to themselves
Of
Of their no-wit , or Honesty , ran routed
At ever Pannick Terror themselves bred .
Where else , as confident as sounding Brass ,
Their tinkling Captain , Cymbal , and the rest ,
Dare put on any Visor , to deride
The wretched , or with Buffoon Licence jest
At whatsoe 're is serious , if not sacred .
Who 's this ?
my Brother ! and restor 'd to Life !
acknowledgeth his elder Brother .
Yes , and sent hither to restore your Wits ,
If your short Madness be not more than Anger ,
Conceived for your Loss ! which I return you .
See here , your Mortgage , Statute , Band , and Wax ,
Without your Broker , come to abide with you ,
And vindicate the Prodigal from stealing
Away the Lady .
Nay , Pecunia her self
Is come to free him fairly , and discharge
All Ties , but those of Love , unto her Person ,
To use her like a Friend , not like a Slave ,
Or like an Idol .
Superstition
Doth violate the Deity it worships ,
No less than Scorn doth .
And believe it , Brother ,
The Use of things is all , and not the Store :
Surfeit and Fulness have kill 'd more than Famine .
The Sparrow , with his little Plumage , flies ,
While the proud Peacock , overcharg 'd with Pens ,
Is fain to sweep the Ground with his grown Train ,
And load of Feathers .
Wise and honour 'd Brother !
None but a Brother , and sent from the Dead ,
As you are to me , could have altered me :
I thank my Destiny , that is so gracious .
Are there no Pains , no Penalties decreed
From whence you come , to us that smother Money
In Chests , and strangle her in Bags ?
O , mighty ,
Intolerable Fines , and Mulcts impos 'd !
( Of which I come to warn you ) Forfeitures
Of whole Estates , if they be known , and taken !
I thank you , Brother , for the light you have
given me ;
I will prevent 'em all .
First free my Dogs ,
Lest what I ha' done to them ( and against Law )
Be a Pr?munire ; for by Magna Charta
They could not be committed , as close Prisoners ,
My Learned Counsel tells me here , my Cook ;
And yet he shew 'd me the way first .
Who did ?
I? I trench the Liberty o ' the Subjects ?
Peace ,
Picklock , your Guest , that Stentor , hath infected you ,
Whom I have safe enough in a wooden Collar .
Next , I restore these Servants to their Lady ,
With Freedom , Heart of chear , and Countenance ;
It is their Year and Day of Jubilee .
We thank you , Sir .
And lastly , to my Nephew
I give my House , Goods , Lands , all but my Vices ,
And those I go to cleanse ; kissing this Lady ,
Whom I do give him too , and join their Hands .
If the Spectators will join theirs , we thank 'em .
And wish they may , as I , enjoy Pecunia .
And so Pecunia her self doth wish ,
That she may still be Aid unto their Uses ,
Not Slave unto their Pleasures , or a Tyrant
Over their fair Desires ; but teach them all
The Golden Mean ; the Prodigal , how to live ;
The sordid , and the covetous , how to die :
That , with sound Mind ; this , safe Frugality .
