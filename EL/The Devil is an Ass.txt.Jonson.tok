To Earth ?
and why to Earth , thou foolish
Spirit ?
What would 'st thou do on Earth ?
For that , great Chief !
As time shall work .
I do but ask my month .
Which every petty pui'ny Devil has ;
Within that term the Court of Hell will hear
Something may gain a longer grant , perhaps .
For what ?
the laming a poor Cow , or two ?
Entring a Sow , to make her cast her Farrow ?
Or crossing of a Market-womans Mare ,
' Twixt this and Totnam ?
these were wont to be
Your main atchievements , Pug , You have some plot now ,
Upon a tonning of Ale , to stale the Yest ,
Or keep the Churn so , that the Butter come not ,
'Spight o ' the Housewives Cord , or her hot Spit ?
Or some good Ribibe , about Kentish Town ,
Or Hogsden , you would hang now , for a Witch ,
Because she will not let you play round Robbin ;
And you 'll go sowre the Citizens Cream 'gainst Sunday ?
That she may be accus 'd for't , and condemn 'd ,
By a Middlesex Jury , to the satisfaction
Of their offended Friends , the Londoners Wives ,
Whose teeth were set on edge with it ?
Foolish Fiend ,
Stay i' your place , know your own strength , and put not
That may concern our Name on Earth .
It is not
Every ones work .
The State of Hell must care
Whom it imploys , in point of Reputation ,
Here about London .
You would make , I think ,
An Agent to be sent for Lancashire ,
Proper enough ; or some parts of Northumberland ,
So yo ' had good Instructions , Pug.
O Chief !
You do not know , dear Chief , what there is in me .
Prove me but for a fortnight , for a week ,
And lend me but a Vice , to carry with me ,
To practice there with any play-fellow ,
And you will see , there will come more upon't ,
Then you 'll imagine , precious Chief .
What Vice ?
What kind wouldst th ' have it of ?
Why , any Fraud ,
Or Covetousness , or Lady Vanity ,
Or old Iniquity : I 'll call him hither .
What is he calls upon me , and would seem to
lack a Vice ?
Ere his words be half spoken , I am with him in a trice ;
Here , there , and every where , as the Cat is with the
Mice :
True vetus Iniquitas .
Lack 'st thou Cards , friend , or Dice ?
I will teach thee cheat , Child , to cog , lie and swagger ,
And ever and anon to be drawing forth thy Dagger :
To swear by Gogs-nowns , like a lusty Juventus ,
In a Cloak to thy Heel , and a Hat like a Penthouse .
Thy Breeches of three Fingers , and thy Doublet all Belly ,
With a Wench that shall feed thee , with Cock-Stones and
Is it not excellent , Chief ?
how nimble he is !
Child of Hell , this is nothing ! I will fetch thee a
leap
From the top of Paul 's Steeple to the Standard in Cheap :
And lead the a daunce through the Streets , without fail ,
Like a Needle of Spain , with a Thread at my tail .
We will survey the Suburbs , and make forth our Sallies ,
Down Petticoat-lane , and up the Smock-Allies ,
To Shoreditch , White-Chappel , and so to Saint Katherns .
To drink with the Dutch there , and take forth their Pat-
terns :
From thence , we will put in at Custom-house Key there ,
And see how the Factors , and Prentices play there ,
False with their Masters ; and gueld many a full Pack ,
To spend it in Pies , at the Dagger and the Wool-Sack .
Brave , brave , Iniquity ! will not this do , Chief ?
Nay , boy , I will bring thee to the Bawds , and the
Roysters ,
At Billings-gate , feasting with Claret-wine and Oysters ;
From thence shoot the Bridge , Child , to the Cranes i' the
Vintry ,
And see there the Gimblets , how they make their entry !
Or if thou hadst rather to the Strand down to fall ,
' Gainst the Lawyers come dabled from Westminster-Hall ,
And mark how they cling , with their Clients together ,
Like Ivy to Oak , so Velvet to Leather :
Ha , boy , I would shew thee .
Rare , rare ! Dev.
Peace , Dotard ,
And thou more ignorant thing , that so admir 'st ,
Art thou the Spirit thou seem 'st ?
so poor ?
to chuse
N n n 2 This
This for a Vice , t ' advance the Cause of Hell ,
Now , as Vice stands this present Year ?
Remember
What number it is , Six Hundred and Sixteen .
Had it but been Five Hundred , though some Sixty
Above ; that 's Fifty years agone , and Six ,
( When every Great Man had his Vice stand by him ,
In his long Coat , shaking his wooden Dagger )
I could consent , that then this your grave choice
Might have done that , with his Lord Chief , the which
Most of his Chamber can do now .
But Pug ,
As the times are , who is it will receive you ?
What Company will you go to ?
or whom mix with ?
Where canst thou carry him , except to Taverns ?
To mount up on a Joynt-Stool , with a Jews trump ,
To put down Cokeley , and that must be to Citizens ?
He ne 're will be admitted there , where Vennor comes .
He may perchance , in tail of a Sheriffs Dinner ,
Skip with a Rime o ' the Table , from New-nothing ,
And take his Almain-leap into a Custard ,
Shall make my Lady Mayoress , and her Sisters ,
Laugh all their Hoods over their Shoulders .
But
This is not that will do , they are other things
That are receiv 'd now upon Earth , for Vices ;
Stranger and newer : and chang 'd every hour .
They ride 'em like their Horses off their Legs ,
And here they come to Hell , whole Legions of 'em ,
Every week tyr 'd .
We still strive to breed ,
And rear 'em up new ones ; but they do not stand ,
When they come there : they turn 'em on our hands .
And it is fear 'd they have a Stud o ' their own
Will put down ours .
Both our Breed and Trade
VVill suddenly decay , if we prevent not .
Unless it be a Vice of Quality ,
Or Fashion now , they take none from us .
Car-men
Are got into the yellow Starch , and Chimney-sweepers
To their Tobacco and Strong-waters , Hum ,
Meath , and Obarni .
VVe must therefore aim
At extraordinary subtle ones now ,
VVhen we do send to keep us up in credit .
Not old Iniquities .
Get you e 'en back , Sir ,
To making of your Rope of Sand again .
You are not for the Manners , nor the Times :
They have their Vices there , most like to Vertues ;
You cannot know 'em apart by any difference :
They wear the same Clothes , eat the same Meat ,
Sleep i' the self-same beds , ride i' those Coaches .
Or very like , Four Horses in a Coach ,
As the best Men and VVomen .
Tissue Gowns ,
Garters and Roses , Fourscore pound a pair ,
Embroidred Stockings , Cut-work Smocks and Shirts ,
More certain Marks of Lechery now and Pride ,
Than e 're they were of true Nobility !
But , Pug , since you do burn with such desire
To do the Commonwealth of Hell some service ;
I am content , assuming of a body ,
You go to earth , and visit Men a day .
But you must take a body ready made , Pug ,
I can create you none : nor shall you form
Your self an airy one , but become subject
To all impression of the Flesh you take ,
So far as humane frailty .
So , this morning ,
There is a handsome Cut-purse hang 'd at Tyburn ,
VVhose Spirit departed , you may enter his body :
For Clothes , imploy your credit with the Hang-man ,
Or let our tribe of Brokers furnish you .
And look how far your Subtilty can work
Thorough those Organs , with that body , spy
Amongst Mankind .
(you cannot there want Vices ,
And therefore the less need to carry 'em wi' you )
But as you make your soon at nights relation ,
And we shall find it merits from the State ,
You shall have both trust from us , and imployment .
Most gracious Chief !
Only thus more I bind you ,
To serve the first man that you meet ; and him
I 'll shew you now : Observe him .
Yon ' is he ,
You shall see first after your clothing .
Follow him :
But once engag 'd , there you must stay and fix ;
Not shift , until the midnights Cock do crow .
Any Conditions to be gone .
Away , then .
They talk 'd of Gresham , and of Doctor Fore-man ,
Franklin , and Fiske , and Savory ( he was in too ) ;
But there 's not one of these that ever could
Yet shew a man the Devil in true sort .
They have their Chrystals , I do know , and Rings ,
And Virgin-Parchment , and their dead mens Sculls ,
Their Ravens VVings , their Lights , and Pentacles ,
VVith Characters ; I ha' seen all these .
But ? ?
VVould I might see the Devil .
I would give
A hundred o ' these Pictures to see him
Once out of Picture .
May I prove a Cuckold ,
( And that 's the one main mortal thing I fear )
If I begin not now to think , the Painters
Have only made him .
' Slight , he would be seen ,
One time or other else .
He would not let
An ancient Gentleman , of a good House
As most are now in England , the Fetz dottrel 's ,
Run wild , and call upon him thus in vain ,
As I ha' done this twelve month .
If he be not
At all , why are there Conjurers ?
If they be not ,
VVhy are there Laws against 'em ?
The best Artists
Of Cambridge , Oxford , Middlesex and London ,
Essex and Kent , I have had in pay to raise him ,
These fifty weeks , and yet h ' appears not .
'Sdeath ,
I shall suspect they can make Circles only
Shortly , and know but his hard names .
They do say ,
H' will meet a man ( of himself ) that has a mind to him :
If he would so , I have a mind and a half for him :
He should not be long absent .
Pray thee come ,
I long for thee .
An' I were with Child by him ,
And my wife too ; I could not more .
Come yet ,
Good Beelzebub .
VVere he a kind Devil ,
And had humanity in him , he would come , but
To save ones longing .
I should use him well ,
I swear , and with respect ( would he would try me )
Not as the Conjurers do , when they ha' rais 'd him ,
Get him in Bonds , and send him Post on Errands
A thousand Miles : it is preposterous , that :
And I believe , is the true Cause he comes not .
And he has reason .
VVho would be engag 'd ,
That might live freely , as he may do ?
I swear ,
They are wrong all .
The burnt Child dreads the fire .
They do not know to entertain the Devil .
I would so welcome him , observe his Diet ,
Get him his Chamber hung with Arras , two of 'em ,
I ' my own house ; lend him my VVives wrought Pil-
lows :
And as I am an honest Man , I think ,
If he had a mind to her too ; I should grant him ,
To make our Friendship perfect .
So I would not
To every man .
If he but hear me now ?
And should come to me in a brave young shape ,
And take me at my word ?
ha ! VVho is this ?
Upon your Privacy .
I am born a Gentleman ,
A younger brother , but in some disgrace ,
Now with my Friends : and want some little means
To keep me upright , while things be reconcil 'd .
Please you to let my Service be of use to you , Sir .
Service ?
'fore Hell , my heart was at my mouth ,
Till I had view 'd his Shooes well : for those Roses
VVere big enough to hide a cloven foot .
No, Friend , my number 's full .
I have one Servant
VVho is my all indeed ; and from the Broom
Unto the Brush : for just so far I trust him .
He is my VVardrobe-man , my Cater , Cook ,
Butler and Steward ; looks unto my Horse ;
And helps to watch my VVife .
H'has all the places ,
That I can think on , from the Garret downward ,
E'en to the Manger , and the Curry-comb .
Sir , I shall put your VVorship to no charge ,
More than my Meat , and that but very little ;
I 'll serve you for your Love .
Ha ! without VVages ?
I 'll hearken o ' that Ear , were I at leisure .
But now I 'm busie .
'Prythe , Friend , forbear me ,
And ' thou hast been a Devil , I should say
Somewhat more to thee .
Thou dost hinder now
My Meditations .
Sir , I am a Devil .
How ! Pug.
A true Devil , Sir .
Nay , now you lie :
Under your favour , Friend , for I 'll not quarrel .
I look 'd o ' your feet afore , you cannot cozen me ,
Your Shooe 's not cloven , Sir , you are whole hoof 'd .
Sir , that 's a popular Error , deceives many :
But I am that I tell you .
What 's your Name ?
My Name is Devil , Sir .
Say 'st thou true .
Indeed , Sir .
' Slid ! there 's some Omen i' this ! what Countryman ?
Of Derby-shire , Sir , about the Peak .
That Hole
Belong 'd to your Ancestors ?
Yes , Devil 's Arse , Sir .
I 'll entertain him for the Name sake .
Ha ?
And turn away my t 'other Man ?
and save
Four Pound a year by that ?
there 's luck and thrift too !
The very Devil may come hereafter as well .
Friend , I receive you : but ( withal ) I acquaint you
Aforehand , if yo ' offend me , I must beat you .
It is a kind of Exercise I use ;
And cannot be without .
Yes , if I do not
Offend , you can sure .
Faith , Devil , very hardly :
I 'll call you by your Surname , 'cause I love it .
To him , good Ingine , raise him up by degrees ,
Gently , and hold him there too , you can do it .
Shew your self now a Mathematical Broker .
I 'll warrant you for half a piece .
' Tis done , Sir .
Is't possible there should be such a Man !
You shall be your own Witness , I 'll not labour
To tempt you past your faith .
And is his Wife
So very handsome , say you ?
I ha' not seen her
Since I came home from travel : and they say ,
She is not alter 'd .
Then , before I went ,
I saw her once ; but so , as she hath stuck
Still i' my view , no Object hath remov 'd her .
' Tis a fair Guest , Friend , Beauty : and once lodg 'd
Deep in the Eyes , she hardly leaves the Inn .
How do 's he keep her ?
Very brave .
However ,
Himself be sordid , he is sensual that way .
In every dressing , he do 's study her .
And furnish forth himself so from the Broker ?
Yes , that 's a hir 'd Suit he now has on ,
To see the Devil is an Ass , to day , in .
( This Ingine gets three or four pound a week by him ) ,
He dares not miss a new Play , or a Feast ,
What Rate soever Clothes be at ; and thinks
Himself still new , in other Mens old .
But stay ,
Do 's he love Meat so ?
Faith , he do 's not hate it .
But that 's not it .
His Belly and his Palate
Would be compounded with for Reason .
Marry ,
A Wit he has , of that strange Credit with him ,
' Gainst all Mankind ; as it doth make him do
Just what it list : it ravishes him forth ,
Whither it please , to any Assembly or Place ,
And would conclude him ruin 'd , should he scape
One publick Meeting , out of the belief
He has of his own great , and Catholick strengths ,
In arguing and Discourse .
It takes , I see :
H' has got the Cloak upon him .
A fair Garment ,
By my Faith , Ingine ! Ing .
It was never made , Sir ,
For threescore pound , I assure you : ' Twill yield thirty .
The Plush , Sir , cost three pound ten shillings a yard !
And then the Lace and Velvet .
I shall , Ingine ,
Be look 'd at , prettily , in it ! Art thou sure
The Play is play 'd to day ?
O here 's the Bill , Sir .
I ' had forgot to gi't you .
Ha ?
the Devil !
I will not lose you , Sirrah ! But , Ingine , think you ,
The Gallant is so furious in his folly ?
So mad upon the Matter , that he 'll part
With 's Cloak upo ' these terms ?
Trust not your Ingine ,
Break me to pieces else , as you would do
A rotten Cain , or an old rusty Jack ,
That has not one true Wheel in him .
Do but talk with him .
I shall do that , to satisfie you , Ingine ,
And my self too .
With your leave , Gentlemen .
Which of you is it is so meer Idolater
To my Wives Beauty , and so very prodigal
Unto my patience , that , for the short Parley ?
Of one swift hours quarter , with my Wife ,
He will depart with ( let me see ) this Cloak here ,
The price of Folly ?
Sir , are you the Man ?
I am that vent 'rer , Sir .
Good time ! your Name
Is Wittipol ?
The same , Sir .
And 'tis told me ,
Yo ' have travell 'd lately ?
That I have , Sir . Fit .
Truly ,
Your Travels may have alter 'd your Complexion ;
But sure , your Wit stood still .
It may well be , Sir .
All Heads ha' not like growth .
The good Man 's Gravity ,
That left you Land , your Father never taught you
These pleasant Matches ?
No, nor can his Mirth ,
With
With whom I make 'em put me off .
You are
Resolv 'd then ?
Yes , Sir .
Beauty is the Saint ,
You 'll sacrifice your self into the Shirt too ?
So I may still cloth , and keep warm your Wisdom ?
You lade me , Sir !
I know what you will bear , Sir .
Well , to the Point .
' Tis only , Sir , you say ,
To speak unto my Wife ?
Only to speak to her .
And in my presence ?
In your very presence .
And in my hearing ?
In your hearing : so
You interrupt us not .
For the short space
You do demand , the fourth part of an hour ,
I think I shall , with some convenient study ,
And this good help to boot , bring my self to't .
I ask no more .
Please you , walk to 'ard my house ,
Speak what you list ; that time is yours : My Right
I have departed with .
But not beyond
A Minute , or a Second , look for .
Length ,
And drawing out , ma' advance much to these Matches .
And I except all kissing .
Kisses are
Silent Petitions still with willing Lovers .
Lovers ?
How falls that o ' your phantsie ?
Sir ,
I do know somewhat , I forbid all Lip-work .
I am not eager at forbidden Dainties .
Who covets unfit things , denies himself .
You say well , Sir , ' Twas prettily said , that same .
He do 's indeed .
I 'll have no touches therefore ,
Nor takings by the Armes , nor tender Circles
Cast 'bout the Wast , but all be done at distance .
Love is brought up with those soft migniard handlings :
His pulse lies in his palm ; and I defend
All melting joynts and fingers , ( that 's my bargain )
And much good do your Rhetoricks heart .
You are welcome , Sir .
Ingine , God b' w ' you .
Sir , I must condition |
To have this Gentleman by , a Witness .
Well ,
I am content , so he be silent .
Yes , Sir .
Come , Devil , I 'll make you room straight .
But
I 'll shew you
First , to your Mistris , who 's no common one ,
You must conceive , that brings this gain to see her .
I hope thou 'st brought me good luck .
I shall do 't , Sir .
' Tis there , Sir .
Be gone .
Friend Manly , who 's within here ?
fixed ?
I am directly in a fit of wonder
What 'll be the issue of this Conference !
For that ne 'er vex your self till the Event .
How like yo ' him ?
I would fain see more of him .
What think you of this ?
I am past degrees of thinking .
Old Africk , and the new America ,
With all their Fruit of Monsters cannot shew
So just a Prodigy .
Could you have believ 'd ,
Without your sight , a mind so sordid inward ,
Should be so specious , and laid forth abroad ,
To all the shew that ever Shop or Ware was ?
I believe any thing now , though I confess
His Vices are the most Extremities
I ever knew in Nature .
But why loves he
The Devil so ?
O Sir ! for hidden Treasure ,
He hopes to find : and has propos 'd himself
So infinite a Mass , as to recover ,
He cares not what he parts with , of the present ,
To his Men of Art , who are the Race , may coyn him .
Promise Gold Mountains , and the covetous
Are still most prodigal .
But ha' you faith ,
That he will hold his Bargain ?
O dear , Sir !
He will not off on't .
Fear him not .
I know him .
One baseness still accompanies another .
See ! he is here already , and his Wife too .
A wondrous handsome creature , as I live !
Nay , blush not .
Mrs. Fit .
Why , what do you mean , Sir ?
ha' you
your Reason ?
Wife ,
I do not know that I have lent it forth
To any one ; at least , without a Pawn , Wife :
Or that I have eat or drunk the thing , of late ,
That should corrupt it .
Wherefore , gentle Wife ,
Obey , it is thy Vertue : hold no acts
Of Disputation .
Mrs. Fit .
Are you not enough
The talk of Feasts and Meetings , but you 'll still
Make argument for fresh ?
Why , careful Wedlock ,
If I have a longing to have one tale more
Go of me , what is that to thee , dear heart ?
Why shouldst thou envy my delight ?
or cross it ?
By being solicitous , when it not concerns thee ?
Mrs. Fit .
Yes , I have share in this .
The scorn will fall
As bitterly on me , where both are laught at .
Laught at , sweet Bird ?
is that the scruple ?
Come , come ,
Thou art a Niaise .
Which of your great Houses ,
crying out of the Nest .
( I will not mean at home here , but abroad )
Your Families in France , Wife , send not forth
Something within the seven year , may be laught at ?
I do not say seven months , nor seven weeks ,
Nor seven days , nor hours : but seven year , Wife .
I give 'em time .
Once within seven year ,
I think they may do something may be laught at .
In France , I keep me there still .
Wherefore , Wife ,
Let them that list , laugh still , rather than weep
For me .
Here is a Cloak cost fifty pound , Wife ,
Which I can sell for thirty , when I ha' seen
All London in't , and London has seen me .
To day I go to the Black-Friers Play-house ,
Sit i' the view , salute all my acquaintance ,
All that pretend to stand for't o ' the Stage )
The Ladies ask , who 's that ?
( For they do come
To see us , Love , as we do to see them )
Now I shall lose all this , for the false fear
Of being laught at ?
Yes , wusse .
Let 'em laugh , Wife ,
Let me have such another Cloak to morrow
And let 'em laugh again , Wife , and again ,
And then grow fat with laughing , and then fatter :
All my young Gallants , let 'em bring their Friends too :
Shall I forbid 'em ?
No, let Heaven forbid 'em :
Or Wit , if't have any charge on 'em .
Come , thy Ear , Wife ,
Is all , I 'll borrow of thee .
Set your Watch , Sir ;
Thou
Thou only art to hear , not speak a word , Dove ,
To ought he says .
That I do gi' you in precept ,
No less than Council , on your Wive-hood , Wife ,
Not though he flatter you , or make Court , or Love ,
( As you must look for these ) or say , he rail ;
VVhat e 're his Arts be , VVife , I will have thee
Delude 'em with a trick , thy obstinate silence ;
I know advantages ; and I love to hit
These pragmatick young men at their own weapons .
Is your VVatch ready ?
Here my Sail bears for you :
Tack toward him , sweet Pinnace , where 's your VVatch ?
and sets his VVatch .
I 'll set it , Sir , with yours .
Mrs. Fit .
I must obey .
Her Modesty seems to suffer with her Beauty ,
And so as if his Folly were away ,
It were worth pity .
Now th ' art right , begin , Sir .
But first , let me repeat the Contract briefly .
I am , Sir , to enjoy this Cloak I stand in ,
Freely , and as your Gift ; upon condition
You may as freely speak here to my Spouse ,
Your quarter of an hour , always keeping
The measur 'd distance of your yard , or more ,
From my said Spouse : and in my sight and hearing .
This is your Covenant ?
Yes , but you 'll allow
For this time spent now ?
Set 'em so much back .
I think I shall not need it .
VVell , begin , Sir ,
There is your bound , Sir . Not beyond that Rush .
If you interrupt me , Sir , I shall discloak you .
The time I have purchast , Lady , is but short ;
And therefore if I imploy it thriftily ,
I hope I stand the nearer to my pardon .
I am not here to tell you , you are fair ,
Or lovely , or how well you dress you , Lady ;
I 'll save my self that Eloquence of your Glass ,
Which can speak these things better to you than I.
And 'tis a Knowledge wherein Fools may be
As wise as a Court-Parliament .
Nor come I
With any prejudice or doubt , that you
Should , to the notice of your own worth , need
Least Revelation .
She 's a simple Woman ,
Knows not her good : ( whoever knows her ill )
And at all characts .
That you are the Wife
To so much blasted Flesh as scarce hath soul ,
Instead of salt , to keep it sweet : I think ,
Will ask no Witnesses to prove .
The cold
Sheets that you lie in , with the watching Candle ,
That sees , how dull to any thaw of Beauty ,
Pieces and quarters , half and whole nights sometimes ,
The Devil-given Elfine Squire , your Husband ,
Doth leave you , quitting here his proper Circle ,
For a much worse , i' the Walks of Lincolns-Inn ,
Under the Elms , t ' expect the Fiend in vain , there
VVill confess for you .
I did look for this Geer .
And what a Daughter of Darkness he does
make you ,
Lock 'd up from all Society , or Object ;
Your Eye not let to look upon a Face ,
Under a Conjurers ( or some Mould for one ,
Hollow and lean , like his ) but by great means ,
As I now make ; your own too sensible sufferings ,
VVithout the extraordinary aids
Of Spells , or Spirits , may assure you , Lady .
For my part , I protest 'gainst all such practice ,
I work by no false Arts , Medicines , or Charms ,
To be said forward and backward .
No, I except .
Sir , I shall ease you .
Nor have I Ends , Lady ,
Upon you , more than this : to tell you how Love ,
Beauties good Angel , he that waits upon her
At all occasions , and no less than Fortune ,
Helps th ' adventrous , in me makes that profer ,
VVhich never fair one was so fond to lose ,
VVho could but reach a hand forth to her freedom .
On the first sight I lov 'd you : since which time ,
Tho I have travell 'd , I have been in travel
More for this second blessing of your Eyes ,
VVhich now I have purchas 'd , than for all aims else .
Think of it , Lady , be your Mind as active
As is your Beauty : view your Object well .
Examine both my fashion and my years ;
Things that are like , are soon familiar :
And Nature joys still in Equality .
Let not the sign o ' the Husband fright you , Lady :
But e 're your Spring be gone , enjoy it .
Flowers ,
Tho fair , are oft but of one Morning .
Think ,
All Beauty doth not last until the Autumn .
You grow old while I tell you this .
And such
As cannot use the present , are not wise .
If Love and Fortune will take care of us ,
VVhy should our will be wanting ?
This is all .
VVhat do you answer , Lady ?
Now the sport comes .
Let him still wait , wait , wait : while the watch goes ,
And the time runs , wife !
How ! not any word ?
Nay , then I taste a Trick in't .
VVorthy Lady ,
I cannot be so false to mine own thoughts
Of your presumed Goodness to conceive
This , as your Rudeness , which I see 's impos 'd .
Yet , since your cautelous Jaylor here stands by you ,
And yo ' are deny 'd the Liberty o ' the House ,
Let me take warrant , Lady , from your silence ,
( VVhich ever is interpreted Consent )
To make your answer for you : which shall be
To as good purpose as I can imagine ,
And what I think you 'ld speak .
No, no , no , no .
I shall resume , Sir .
Sir , what do you mean ?
One interruption more , Sir , and you go
Into your Hose and Doublet , nothing saves you .
And therefore hearken .
This is for your VVife .
You must play fair , Sir .
Stand for me , good Friend .
Troth , Sir , 'tis more than true that you have utt 'red
Of my unequal and so sordid Match here ,
VVith all the Circumstances of my Bondage .
I have a Husband , and a two-legg 'd one ,
But such a Moonling , as no wit of Man
Or Roses can redeem from being an Ass .
H' is grown too much the story of Mens Mouthes ,
To scape his lading : Should I make 't my study ,
And lay all ways , yea , call Mankind to help
To take his burden off ; why , this one act
Of his , to let his VVife out to be courted ,
And at a price , proclaims his Asinine Nature
So loud , as I am weary of my Title to him .
But , Sir , you seem a Gentleman of Vertue ,
No less than Blood ; and one that every way
Looks as he were of too good Quality ,
To intrap a credulous VVoman , or betray her :
Since you have paid thus dear , Sir , for a Visit ,
And made such venture on your VVit and Charge
Meerly to see me , or at most , to speak to me ,
I were too stupid ; or ( what 's worse ) ingrate
Not to return your venture .
Think but how
I may with safety do it , I shall trust
My Love and Honour to you , and presume ,
You 'll
You 'll ever husband both , against this Husband ;
Who , if we chance to change his liberal Ears ,
To other Ensigns , and with labour make
A new Beast of him , as he shall deserve ,
Cannot complain , he is unkindly dealt with .
This day he is to go to a new Play , Sir ,
From whence no Fear , no , nor Authority ,
Scarcely the Kings Command , Sir , will restrain him ,
Now you have fitted him with a Stage-garment ,
For the meer names sake , were there no things else ;
And many more such Journeys he will make .
Which , if they now , or any time hereafter ,
Offer us opportunity , you hear , Sir ,
Who 'll be as glad , and forward to embrace ,
Meet , and enjoy it chearfully as you .
I humbly thank you , Lady .
Keep your ground , Sir .
Will you be lightned ?
And but I am ,
By the sad Contract , thus to take my leave of you
At this so envious distance , I had taught
Our Lips e 're this , to seal the happy mixture
Made of our Souls .
But we must both now yield
To the necessity .
Do not think yet , Lady ,
But I can kiss , and touch , and laugh , and whisper ,
And do those Crowning Courtships too , for which
Day , and the Publick , have allow 'd no Name ;
But now my Bargain binds me .
' Twere rude Injury
T' importune more , or urge a Noble Nature ,
To what of its own Bounty it is prone to :
Else I should speak ? ?
But , Lady , I love so well ,
As I will hope you 'll do so too .
I have done , Sir .
Well , then , I ha' won ?
Sir , and I may win too .
O yes ! no doubt on't .
I 'll take careful Order ,
That she shall hang forth Ensigns at the Window ,
To tell you when I am absent .
Or I 'll keep
Three or Four Foot-men , ready still of purpose ,
To run and fetch you at her Longings , Sir .
I 'll go bespeak me straight a gilt Caroch ,
For her and you to take the Air in : yes ,
Into Hide-Park , and thence into Black-Fryers ,
Visit the Painters , where you may see Pictures ,
And note the properest Limbs , and how to make 'em .
Or what do you say unto a midling Gossip ?
To bring you aye together , at her lodging ?
Under pretext of teaching o ' my Wife
Some rare Receipt of drawing Almond Milk ?
ha ?
It shall be a part of my care .
Good Sir , God b' w ' you .
I ha' kept the Contract , and the Cloak is mine own .
Why , much good do 't you Sir ; it may fall out ,
That you ha' bought it dear , though I ha' not sold it .
A pretty Riddle ! Fare you well , good Sir .
Wife , your Face this way , look on me , and think
Ya' have had a wicked Dream , Wife , and forget it .
This is the strangest Motion I e 're saw .
Now , Wife , sits this fair Cloak the worse upon me
For my great sufferings , or your little patience ?
ha ?
They laugh , you think ?
Mrs. Fit .
Why , Sir , and you might see 't .
What thought they have of you , may be soon collected
By the Young Gentleman 's Speech .
Young Gentleman ?
Death ! you are in love with him , are you ?
Could he not
Be nam 'd the Gentleman , without the Young ?
Up to your Cabbin again .
Mrs. Fit .
My Cage , yo ' were best
To call it ?
Yes , sing there .
You 'ld fain be making
Blanck Manger with him at your Mothers ! I know you .
Go , get you up .
How now ! what say you , Devil ?
I thought he brought some news of a Bro-
ker ! Well ,
Let him come in , good Devil ; fetch him else .
O , my fine Ingine ! what 's th ' affair ?
More Cheats ?
No, Sir , the Wit , the Brain , the great Projector ,
I told you of , is newly come to Town .
Where , Ingine ?
I ha' brought him ( H' is without )
E're he pull 'd off his Boots , Sir , but so follow 'd ,
For businesses .
But what is a Projector ?
I would conceive .
Why , one , Sir , that projects
Ways to enrich Men , or to make 'em great ,
By Suits , by Marriages , by Undertakings :
According as he sees they humour it .
Can he not conjure at all ?
I think he can , Sir ,
( To tell you true . )
But you do know , of late ,
The State hath tane such note of 'em , and compell 'd 'em
To enter such great Bonds , they dare not practice .
' Tis true , and I lie fallow for't the while !
O , Sir ! you 'll grow the richer for the rest .
I hope I shall : but , Ingine , you do talk
Somewhat too much o ' my Courses .
My Cloak-Cu-
stomer
Could tell me strange particulars .
By my means ?
How should he have 'em else ?
You do not know , Sir ,
What he has : and by what Arts ! A money 'd Man , Sir ,
And is as great with your Almanack-Men as you are !
That Gallant ?
You make the other wait too long here :
And he is extream punctual .
Is he Gallant ?
Sir , you shall see : He ' is in his Riding Suit ,
As he comes now from Court .
But hear him speak :
Minister Matter to him , and then tell me .
Fit to run out on Errands : Let her go .
Via Pecunia ! when she 's run and gone ,
And fled , and dead ; then will I fetch her again
With Aqua-Vit? , out of an Old Hogs-head !
While there are Lees of Wine , or Dregs of Beer ,
I 'll never want her ! Coyn her out of Cobwebs ,
Dust , but I 'll have her ! Raise Wooll upon Egg-shells ,
Sir , and make Grass grow out o ' Marrow-bones ,
To make her come .
( Commend me to your Mistris .
Say , let the Thousand Pound but be had ready ,
And it is done ) I would but see the Creature
( Of Flesh and Blood ) the Man , the Prince indeed ,
That could imploy so many Millions
As I would help him to .
How talks he ?
Millions ?
( I 'll give you an account of this to morrow . )
Yes , I will talk no less , and do it too ;
If they were Myriades : and without the Devil ,
By direct means , it shall be good in Law .
Tell Mr. Woodcock , I 'll not fail to meet him
Upon th ' Exchange at night .
Pray him to have
The Writings there , and we 'll dispatch it : Sir ,
You are a Gentleman of a good Presence ,
A handsom Man , ( I have considered you )
As a fit Stock to graft Honours upon :
I have
I have a Project to make you a Duke now .
That you must be one , within so many Months ,
As I set down , out of true Reason of State ,
You sha' not avoid it .
But you must harken then .
Harken ?
why Sir , do you doubt his Ears ?
Alas !
You do not know Master Fitz-dottrel .
He do 's not know me indeed .
I thank you , Ingine ,
For rectifying him .
Good ! Why , Ingine , then
I 'll tell it you .
( I see you ha' Credit , here ,
And , that you can keep counsel , I 'll not question . )
He shall but be an undertaker with me ,
In a most feasible Business .
It shall cost him
Good , Sir .
Except he please , but 's Countenance ;
( That I will have ) t 'appear in't , to great Men ,
For which I 'll make him one .
He shall not draw
A String of 's Purse .
I 'll drive his Pattent for him .
We 'll take in Citizens , Commoners , and Aldermen ,
To bear the charge , and blow 'em off again ,
Like so many dead Flyes , when 'tis carried .
The thing is for recovery of drown 'd Land ,
Whereof the Crown 's to have a Moiety ,
If it be Owner ; Else the Crown and Owners
To share that Moiety , and the Recoverers
T'enjoy the t 'other Moiety for their charge .
Throughout England ?
Yes , which will arise
To Eighteen Millions , Seven the first year :
I have computed all , and made my Survey
Unto my Acre : I 'll begin at the Pan ,
Not at the Skirts ; as some ha' done , and lost
All that they wrought , their Timber-work , their Trench ,
Their Banks , all born away , or else fill 'd up
By the next Winter .
Tut , they never went
The way : I 'll have it all .
A Gallant Tract
Of Land it is ! Mer .
' Twill yield a Pound an Acre .
We must let cheap , ever at first .
But Sir ,
This looks too large for you , I see .
Come hither ,
We 'll have a less .
Here 's a plain Fellow , you see him ,
Has his black Bag of Papers there , in Buckram ,
Wi' not be sold for th ' Earldom of Pancridge : Draw ,
Gi' me out one by chance .
Project ; four Dogs Skins ?
Twelve thousand Pound ! the very worst at first .
Pray you let 's see 't , Sir . Mer .
' Tis a Toy , a Trifle !
Trifle ! Twelve thousand Pound for Dogs Skins ?
Mer Yes , but , by my way of dressing , you must
know , Sir ,
And med'cining the Leather , to a height
Of improv 'd Ware , like your Borachio
Of Spain , Sir , I can fetch Nine thousand for't ?
Of the Kings Glover ?
Yes , how heard you that ?
Sir , I do know you can .
Within this Hour :
And reserve half my Secret .
Pluck another ;
See if thou hast a happier Hand : I thought so .
The very next worse to it ! Bottle-ale .
Yet , this is Two and twenty thousand ?
Yes , Sir , it 's cast to Penny-hal 'penny-farthing .
O' the back-side , there you may see it , read ,
I will not bate a Harrington o ' the Sum .
I 'll win it i' my Water , and my Malt ,
My Furnaces , and hanging o ' my Coppers ,
The tonning , and the subtility o ' my Yest ;
And , then the Earth of my Bottles , which I dig ,
Turn up , and steep , and work , and neal , my self ,
To a degree of Porc'lane .
You will wonder ,
At my Proportions , what I will put up
In Seven years ! for so long time I ask
For my Invention .
I will save in Cork ,
In my mere stop 'ling , 'bove Three thousand Pound
Within that Term : by googing of 'em out
Just to the size of my Bottles , and not slicing .
There 's infinite loss i' that .
What hast thou there ?
O' making Wine of Raisins : this is in hand now ,
Is not that strange , Sir , to make Wine of Raisins ?
Yes , and as true a Wine as th ' Wines of France ,
Or Spain , or Italy : Look of what Grape
My Raisin is , that Wine I 'll render perfect ,
As of the Muscatell Grape , I 'll render Muscatell ;
Of the Canary his ; the Claret his ;
So of all kinds : and bate you of the Prices
Of Wine throughout the Kingdom half in half .
But , how , Sir , if you raise the other Commodity ,
Raisins ?
Why , then I 'll make it out of Black-berries :
And it shall do the same .
' Tis but more Art ,
And the Charge less .
Take out another .
No, good Sir ,
Save you the trouble .
I 'll not look , nor hear
Of any , but your first , there : the Drown 'd-land :
If't will do , as you say .
Sir , there 's not Place
To gi' you demonstration of these things ,
They are a little to subtile .
But , I could shew you
Such a necessity in't , as you must be ,
But what you please : against the receiv 'd Heresie ,
That England bears no Dukes .
Keep you the Land , Sir ,
The greatness of th ' Estate shall throw't upon you .
If you like better turning it to Money ,
VVhat may not you , Sir , purchase with that wealth ?
Say you should part with two o ' your Millions ,
To be the thing you would , who would not do 't ?
As I protest , I will , out of my Divident ,
Lay , for some petty Principality ,
In Italy , from the Church : Now , you perhaps ,
Fancy the Smoak of England , rather ?
But ?
Ha' you no private Room , Sir , to draw to ,
T' enlarge our selves more upon ?
O yes , Divel !
These , Sir , are Businesses , ask to be carried
With caution , and in Cloud .
I apprehend ,
They do so , Sir . Divel , which way is your Mistris ?
Above , Sir , in her Chamber .
O that 's well .
Then , this way , good Sir .
I shall follow you ; Trains ,
Gi' me the Bag , and go you presently ,
Commend my Service to my Lady Tailbush .
Tell her I am come from Court this Morning ; say ,
I have got our business mov 'd , and well : Intreat her ,
That she give you the Four-score Angels , and see 'em
Dispos 'd of to my Council , Sir Poul Eitherside .
Sometime , to day , I 'll wait upon her Ladiship ,
With the Relation .
Sir , of what dispatch ,
He is ! Do you mark ?
Ingine , when did you see
My Cousin Ever-ill?keeps
he still your Quarter
I ' the Bermudas ?
Yes , Sir , he was writing
This morning , very hard .
Be not you known to
him ,
That I am come to Town : I have effected
A Business for him , but I would have it take him ,
Before he thinks for't .
Is it past ?
Not yet .
' Tis well o ' the way .
O Sir ! your Worship takes
Infinite pains .
I love Friends , to be active :
A sluggish Nature puts off Man , and kind .
And such a Blessing follows it .
I thank
My Fate .
Pray you let 's be private , Sir . Fit .
In , here .
Where none may interrupt us .
You hear , Divel ,
Lock the Street-doors fast , and let no one in
( Except they be this Gentlemans Followers )
To trouble me .
Do you mark ?
Yo ' have heard and seen
Something to day ; and , by it , you may gather
Your Mistris is a Fruit , that 's worth the stealing ,
And therefore worth the watching .
Be you sure , now ,
Yo ' have all your Eyes about you ; and let in
No Lace-woman ; nor Bawd , that brings French-Masks ,
And Cut-works .
See you ?
Nor old Croans , with
Wafers ,
To convey Letters .
Nor no youths , disguis 'd
Like Country-wives , with Cream , and Marrow-puddings .
O o o Much
Much Knavery may be vented in a Pudding ,
Much bawdy Intelligence : They ' are shrewd Siphers .
Nor turn the Key to any Neighbours need ;
Be 't but to kindle Fire , or beg a little ,
Put it out , rather : all out , to an Ash ,
That they may see no Smoak .
Or Water , spill it ;
Knock o ' the empty Tubs , that by the sound
They may be forbid entry .
Say , we are robb 'd ,
If any come to borrow a Spoon , or so .
I wi' not have good Fortune , or Gods Blessing
Let in , while I am busie .
I 'll take care , Sir .
They sha' not trouble you if they would .
Well , do so .
Nor no superlative Master ?
I shall wish
To be in Hell again at leisure ?
Bring
A Vice from thence ?
That had been such a subtilty ,
As to bring Broad-clothes hither ; or transport
Fresh Oranges into Spain .
I find it now ;
My Chief was i' the right .
Can any Fiend
Boast of a better Vice , then here by Nature
And Art th ' are owners of ?
Hell ne 'er own me ,
But I am taken ! the fine Tract of it
Pulls me along ! To hear Men such Professors
I will deserve so well of my fair Mistris
By my Discoveries first ; my Counsels after ;
And keeping counsel , after that : as who ,
So ever is one , I 'll be another sure ,
I 'll ha' my share .
Most delicate damn 'd Flesh !
She will be ! O ! that I could stay time , now ,
Midnight will come too fast upon me , I fear ,
To cut my Pleasure ?
Mrs. Fit .
Look at the Back-door ,
One knocks , see who it is .
Dainty She-Devil !
Mrs. Fit .
I cannot get this venture of the Cloke ,
Out of my fancy ; nor the Gentlemans way
He took , which though 'twere strange , yet 'twas handsom ,
And had a Grace withal , beyond the newness .
Sure he will think me that dull stupid Creature ,
He said , and my conclude it ; if I find not
Some thought to thank th ' attempt .
He did presume ,
By all the Carriage of it , on my Brain ,
For answer ; and will swear 'tis very Barren ,
If it can yield him no return .
Who is it ?
Mistris , it is , but first , let me assure
The Excellence of Mistresses , I am ,
Although my Masters Man , my Mistris Slave ,
The Servant of her Secrets , and sweet Turns ,
And know , what fitly will conduce to either .
Mrs. Fit .
What 's this ?
I pray you come to your self ,
and think
What your part is ; to make an answer .
Tell ,
Who is at the Door ?
The Gentleman , Mistris ,
Who was at the Cloak-charge to speak with you ,
This Morning , who expects only to take
Some small Command 'ments from you , what you please ,
Worthy your Form , he says , and gentlest Manners .
Mrs. Fit .
O ! you 'll anon prove his hir 'd man , I fear ,
What has he giv'n you , for this Message ?
Sir ,
Bid him put off his hopes of Straw , and leave
To spread his Nets , in view , thus .
Though they take
Master Fitz dotterel , I am no such foul
Nor fair one , tell him , will be had with stalking ;
And wish him to forbear his acting to me ,
At the Gentlemans Chamber-window in Lincolns-Inn there ,
That opens to my Gallery ; else I swear
T' acquaint my Husband with his Folly , and leave him
To the just rage of his offended Jealousie .
Or if your Masters Sense be not so quick
To right me , tell him , I shall find a Friend
That will repair me .
Say , I will be quiet .
In mine own House ?
Pray you , in those words give it him .
This is some Fool turn 'd !
Mrs. Fit .
If he be the Master ,
Now , of that State and Wit which I allow him ;
Sure , he will understand me : I durst not
Be more direct ; For this officious Fellow ,
My Husbands new Groom , is a Spy upon me ,
I find already .
Yet , if he but tell him
This in my words , he cannot but conceive
Himself both apprehended and requited .
I would not have him think he met a Statue ;
Or spoke to one , not there , though I were silent .
How now ?
ha' you told him ?
Mrs. Fit .
And what says he ?
Says he ?
That which my self would say to you ,
if I durst .
That you are proud , sweet Mistriss ?
and withal ,
A little Ignorant , to entertain
The Good that 's proffer 'd ; and ( by your Beauties leave )
Not all so wise , as some true Politick Wife
Would be ; who having match 'd with such a Nupson
( I speak it with my Masters Peace ) whose Face
Hath left t 'accuse him , now , for't doth confess him ,
What you can make him ; will yet ( out of Scruple ,
And a spic 'd Conscience ) defraud the poor Gentleman ,
At least delay him in the thing he longs for ,
And makes it his whole Study , how to compass
Only a Title .
Could but he write Cuckold ,
He had his ends .
For , look you ?
Mrs. Fit .
This can be
None but my Husbands Wit .
My pretious Mistris .
Mrs. Fit .
It creaks his Ingine : The Groom never durst
Be else so sawcy ?
If it were not clearly ,
His worshipful Ambition ; and the top of it ;
The very forked top too : why should he
Keep you thus mur 'd up in a back Room , Mistris ,
Allow you ne 'er a Casement to the Street ,
Fear of engendering by the Eyes , with Gallants ,
Forbid you Paper , Pen and Ink , like Rats-bane ,
Search your half Pint of Muscatel , lest a Letter
Be sunck i' the Pot : and hold your new-laid Egg
Against the Fire , lest any charm be writ there ?
Will you make benefit of Truth , dear Mistris ,
If I do tell it you : I do 't not often :
I am set over you , imploy 'd indeed
To watch your Steps , your Looks , your very Breathings ,
And to report them to him .
Now , if you
Will be a true , right delicate sweet Mistris ,
Why , we will make a Cokes of this Wise Master ,
We will , my Mistris , an absolute fine Cokes ,
And mock , to air , all the deep Diligences
Of such a solemn and effectual Ass ,
An Ass to so good purpose as we 'll use him .
I will contrive it so , that you shall go
To Plays , to Masks , to Meetings , and to Feasts .
For , why is all this Rigging , and fine Tackle , Mistris ,
If you neat handsom Vessels , of good sail ,
Put not forth ever and anon with your Nets
Abroad into the World .
It is your fishing .
There , you shall choose your Friends , your Servants , Lady ,
Your Squires of Honour ; I 'll convey your Letters ,
Fetch Answers , do you all the Offices
That can belong to your Blood and Beauty .
And ,
For the variety at my times , although
I am not in due Symmetry , the Man
Of that Proportion ; or in Rule
Of Physick , of the just Complexion ;
Or of that Truth of Picardill , in Clothes ,
To boast a Soveraignty o 're Ladies : yet
II know , to do my turns , sweet Mistris .
Come , kiss ?
Mrs. Fit .
How now !
Dear delicate Mistris , I am your Slave ,
Your little Worm , that loves you : your fine Monkey ;
Your Dog , your Jack , your Pug , that longs to be
Stil 'd o ' your Pleasures .
Mrs. Fit .
Hear you all this ?
Sir , pray you ,
Come from your standing , do , a little , spare
Your self , Sir , from your watch , t ' applaud your Squire ,
That so well follows your Intructions !
what 's the matter .
Mrs. Fit .
Good !
You are a stranger to the Plot ! you set not
Your sawcy Devil , here to tempt your Wife ,
With all the insolent uncivil Language ,
Did you so , Devil ?
Hole to hear him ,
Upo ' the Stairs ?
or here , behind the Hangings ?
I do not know your Qualities ?
he durst do it ,
And you not give Directions ?
You shall see Wife ,
Whether he durst or no ; and what it was I did direct .
with a Cudgel upon him .
Sweet Mistris , are you mad ?
You most meer Rogue ! you open manifest Villain !
You Fiend apparent you ! you declar 'd Helhound !
Good Sir . Fit .
Good Knave , good Rascal , and
good Traitor .
Now , I do find you parcel Devil indeed .
Upo ' the Point of Trust ?
I ' your first Charge ?
The very day o ' your Probation ?
To tempt your Mistris ?
Yo do see , good Wedlock ,
How I directed him .
Mrs. Fit .
Why , where Sir , were you ?
Nay , there is one blow more for Exercise :
I told you , I should do it .
Would you had done , Sir .
O Wife , the rarest man ! yet there 's another
To put you in mind o ' the last , such a brave man , Wife !
Within , he has his Projects , and does vent 'em ,
The gallantest ! where you tentiginous ?
ha ?
Would you be acting of the Incubus ?
Did her Silks rustling move you ?
Gentle Sir .
Out of my sight .
If thy Name were not Devil ,
Thou should 'st not stay a Minute with me .
In ,
Go , yet stay : yet go too .
I am resolv 'd
What I will do : and you shall know't afore-hand .
Soon as the Gentleman is gone , do you hear ?
I 'll help your lisping .
Wife , such a Man Wife !
He has such Plots ! He will make me a Duke !
No less by Heaven ! Six Mares to your Coach , VVife !
That 's your Proportion ! And your Coach-man bald ,
Because he shall be bare enough .
Do not you laugh ,
VVe are a looking for a Place , and all i' the Map
VVhat to be of .
Have faith , be not an Infidel .
You know I am not easie to be gull 'd .
I swear , when I have my Millions , else I 'll make
Another Dutchess ; if you ha' not Faith .
Mrs. Fit .
You 'll ha' too much , I fear , in these false Spirits ,
Spirits ?
O , no such thing ! VVife ! wit , meer wit !
This Man defies the Devil and all his VVorks !
He dos't by Ingine , and devises , he !
He has his winged Ploughs , that go with Sails ,
VVill plough you Forty Acres , at once ! and Mills
VVill spout you Water ten miles off ! All Crowland
Is ours VVife ; and the Fens , from us , in Norfolk ,
To the utmost bounds of Lincoln-shire ! we have view 'd it ,
And measur 'd it within all ; by the Scale !
The richest Tract of Land , Love , i' the Kingdom !
There will be made Seventeen or eighteen Millions ;
Or more , as't may be handled ! wherefore think ,
Sweet heart , if th ' hast a fancy to one Place
More than another , to be Dutchess of ;
Now , name it : I will ha't what ere it cost ,
( If't will be had for Money ) either here ,
Or 'in France , or Italy .
Mrs. Fit .
You ha' strange Phantasies !
I see thou hast no Talent
This way , VVife .
Up to thy Gallery ; do Chuck ,
Leave us to talk of it , who understand it .
I think we ha' found a Place to fit you , now , Sir .
O , no , I 'll none !
VVhy , Sir ?
' Tis fatal .
That you say right in .
Spenser , I think the younger .
Had his last Honour thence .
But , he was but Earl .
I know not that , Sir . But Thomas of Woodstock ,
I 'm sure , was Duke , and he was made away
At Calice , as Duke Humphery was at Bury :
And Richard the Third , you know what end he came too .
By m ' faith you are cunning i' the Chronicle , Sir .
No, I confess I ha't from the Play books ,
And think they 'are more Authentick .
That 's sure , Sir .
VVhat say you ( to this then )
No, a noble House .
Pretends to that .
I will do no Man wrong .
Then take one Proposition more , and hear it
As past exception .
What 's that ?
To be
Duke of those Lands , you shall recover : take
Your Title thence , Sir , Duke of the Drown 'd Lands ,
Or Drown 'd-land .
Ha ?
that last has a good sound !
I like it well .
The Duke of Drown 'd-land ?
Yes ;
It goes like Groen-land , Sir , if you mark it .
I ,
And drawing thus your honour from the work ,
You make the Reputation of that , greater ;
And stay 't the longer i' your Name .
' Tis true .
Drown 'd-lands will live in Drown 'd-land !
Yes , when you
Ha' no foot left ; as that must be , Sir , one day .
And , though it tarry in your Heirs , some Forty ,
Fifty Descents , the longer liver , at last , y et ,
Must thrust 'em out on't : if no Quirk in Law ,
Or odd Vice o ' their own not do it first .
We see those changes , daily : the fair Lands ,
That were the Clyents , are the Lawyers , now :
And those rich Mannors , there , of Good-man Taylors ,
Had once more Wood upon 'em , then the Yard ,
By which th ' were measur 'd out for the last Purchase .
Nature hath these vicissitudes .
She makes
No man a state of Perpetuety , Sir .
Yo ' are i' the right .
Let 's in then , and conclude .
I my sight , again ?
I 'll talk with you anon .
Pluck out my Tongue , one o ' the two .
This Fool ,
There is no trusting of him : and to quit him ,
Were a contempt against my Chief , past pardon .
It was a shrewd disheartning this , at first !
Who would ha' thought a Woman so well harness 'd ,
Or rather well-caparison 'd , indeed ,
O o o 2 That
That wears such Petticoats , and Lace to her Smocks ,
Broad Seaming Laces ( as I see 'em hang there )
And Garters which are lost , if she can shew 'em ,
Could ha' done this ?
Hell ! why is she so brave ?
It cannot be to please Duke Dotterel , sure ,
Nor the dull Pictures in her Gallery ,
Yet that may be : I have known many of 'em
Begin their Pleasure , but none end it there :
( That I consider , as I go along with it )
They may , for want of better Company ,
Or that they think the better , spend an hour ;
Two , three , or four , discoursing with their Shaddow :
But sure they have a farther Speculation .
No Woman drest with so much care , and study ,
Doth dress her self in vain .
I 'll vex this Problem ,
A little more , before I leave it sure .
That this should prove thy Chamber ; which I fear 'd
Would be my greatest trouble ! this must be
The very Window , and that the Room .
It is .
I now remember , I have often seen there
A Woman , but I never mark 'd her much .
Where was your soul , Friend ?
Faith , but now and then ,
Awake unto those Objects .
You pretend so .
Let me not live , if I am not in love
More with her wit , for this direction now ,
Then with her Form , though I ha' prais 'd that prettily ,
Since I saw her and you to day .
Read those .
a Song .
They 'll go unto the Air you love so well .
Try 'em unto the Note , may be the Musick
Will call her sooner ; light , she 's here ! Sing quickly .
Mrs. Fit .
Either he understood him not : or else ,
The Fellow was not faithful in delivery
Of what I bad .
And , I am justly pay 'd ,
That might have made my Profit of his Service ,
But by mistaking , have drawn on his Envy ,
And done the worse defeat upon my self .
How ! Musick ?
then he may be there : and is sure .
O ! Is it so ?
Is there the Enter-view ?
Have I drawn to you , at last , my cunning Lady ?
The Devil is an Ass ! fool 'd off ! and beaten !
Nay , made an Instrument ! and could not sent it !
Well , since yo ' have shewn the malice of a VVoman ,
No less then her true VVit and Learning , Mistris ,
I 'll try , if little Pug have the malignity
To recompence it , and so save his danger .
' Tis not the Pain , but the Discredit of it ,
The Devil should not keep a Body intire .
Away , fall back , she comes .
I 'll leave you , Sir ,
The Master of my Chamber .
I have business .
Mistris ! Mrs. Fit .
You make me Paint , Sir .
The ' are fair Colours Lady , and natural ! I did receive
Some Commands from you , lately , gentle Lady ,
But so perplex 'd , and wrap 'd in the Delivery ,
As I may fear to have mis-interpreted :
But must make suit still , to be neer your Grace .
Mrs. Fit .
Who is there with you , Sir ?
None but my self .
It falls out , Lady , to be a dear Friends Lodging .
Wherein there 's some Conspiracy of Fortune
With your poor Servants blest Affections .
Mrs. Fit .
Who was it sung ?
He , Lady , but he 's gone ,
Upon my Entreaty of him , seeing you
Approach the Window .
Neither need you doubt him ,
If he were here .
He is too much a Gentleman .
Mrs. Fit .
You may with Justice , say , I am a Woman :
And a strange Woman .
But when you shall please ,
To bring but that concurrence of my Fortune
To Memory , which to day your self did urge :
It may beget some favour like excuse ,
Though none like Reason .
No, my tune-full Mistris ?
Then , surely , Love hath none ; nor Beauty any ;
Nor Nature violenced in both these :
With all whose gentle Tongues you speak , at once .
I thought I had enough remov 'd already
That Scruple from your Breast , and left yo ' all Reason ;
When through my Mornings Perspective I shew 'd you
A Man so above Excuse , as he is the Cause ,
Why any thing is to be done upon him ;
And nothing call 'd an Injury mis-plac 'd .
I ' rather , now had hope , to shew you how Love
By his Accesses grows more Natural :
And , what was done this Morning with such force ,
Was but devis 'd to serve the present , then .
That since Love hath the Honour to approach
These Sister-swelling Breasts ; and touch this soft
And rosie Hand ; he hath the skill to draw
Their Nectar forth , with kissing ; and could make
More wanton 'salts , from this brave Promontory ,
Down to this Valley , then the nimble Roe ;
Could play the hopping Sparrow 'bout these Nets ;
And sporting Squirel in these crisped Groves ;
Bury himself in every Silk-worms Kell ,
Is here unravell 'd ; run into the Snare ,
Which every Hair is , cast into a Curl ,
To catch a Cupid flying : Bathe himself
In Milk and Roses here , and dry him there ;
Warm his cold Hands , to play with this smooth , round ,
And well torn 'd Chin , as with the Billyard-ball ;
Rowl on these Lips , the Banks of Love , and there
At once both plant and gather Kisses .
Lady ,
Shall I , with what I have made to day here , call
All Sense to Wonder , and all Faith to sign
The Mysteries revealed in your Form ?
And will Love pardon me the Blasphemy
I utter 'd , when I said , a Glass could speak
This Beauty , or that Fools had Power to judge it ?
Do but look on her Eyes ! They do light ? ?
All that Love 's World comprizeth !
Do but look on her Hair ! it is bright ,
As Love 's Star , when it riseth !
Do but mark , her Fore-head 's smoother ,
Then words that sooth her !
And from her arched Brows , such a Grace
Sheds it self through the Face ;
As alone , there Triumphs to the Life ,
All the Gain , all the Good , of the Elements strife !
Have you seen but a bright Lilly grow ,
Before rude hands have touch 'd it ?
Have you mark 'd but the fall of the Snow ,
Before the Soyl hath smuch 'd it ?
Have you felt the Wooll o ' the Bever ?
Or Swans Down , ever ?
Or , have smelt o ' the Bud o ' the Bryer ?
Or the Nard i' the Fire ?
Or , have tasted the Bag o ' the Bee ?
O , so white ! O , so soft ! O , so sweet is she !
IS she so , Sir ?
and I will keep her so ,
If I know how , or can : that wit of Man
Will do 't , I 'll go no farther .
At this Windo '
She shall no more be buz 'd at .
Take your leave on't .
If you be sweet Meats , Wedlock , or sweet Flesh ,
All 's one : I do not love this hum about you .
A Fly-blown Wife is not so proper , in :
For you , Sir , look to hear from me .
So , I do , Sir .
No, but in other terms .
There 's no Man offers
This to my Wife , but pays for't .
That have I , Sir .
Nay , then , I tell you , you are .
What am I , Sir ?
Why , that I 'll think on , when I ha' cut your
Go , you are an Ass .
I am resolv 'd on't , Sir .
I think you are .
To call you to a reckoning .
Away you Brokers Block , you Property .
' Slight , if you strike me , I 'll strike your Mistris ,
O ! I could shoot mine Eyes at him , for that , now ;
Or leave my Teeth in him , were they Cuckolds bane
Enough to kill him .
What prodigious ,
Blind , and most wicked change of Fortune 's this ?
I ha' no Air of Patience : all my Veins
Swell , and my Sinews start at iniquity of it .
I shall break , break .
This for the Malice of it ,
And my Revenge may pass ! But , now , my Conscience
Tells me , I have profited the Cause of Hell
But little , in the breaking off their Loves .
Which , if some other act of mine repair not ,
I shall hear ill of in my account .
as come down .
O , Bird !
Could you do this ?
'gainst me ?
and at this time , now ?
VVhen I was so imploy 'd , wholly for you ,
Drown 'd i' my care ( more than the Land , I swear ,
I 'have hope to win ) to make you peer-less ?
studying ,
For Footmen for you , fine pac 'd Huishers , Pages ,
To serve you o ' the Knee ; with what Knights Wife ,
To bear your Train , and sit with your four Women
In Council , and receive Intelligences ,
From Foreign parts , to dress you at all Pieces !
Y' have ( a 'most ) turn 'd my good Affection to you ;
Sowr 'd my sweet Thoughts ; all my pure Purposes :
I could now find ( i' my very Heart ) to make
Another Lady Dutchess , and depose you .
VVell , go your ways in .
Devil , you have redeem 'd all .
I do forgive you .
And I 'll do you good .
where ha' you been ,
Sir ?
VVhere I ha' been vex 'd a little , with a Toy !
O Sir ! no Toys must trouble your grave Head ,
Now it is growing to be great .
You must
Be above all those things .
Nay , nay , so I will .
Now you are to 'ard the Lord , you must put off
The Man , Sir . Ing .
He says true .
You must do nothing
As you ha' done it heretofore ; not know ,
Or salute any Man .
That was your Bedfellow ,
The other Month .
The other Month ?
the Week .
Thou dost not know the Priviledges , Ingine ,
Follow that Title ; nor how swift : To day ,
When he has put on his Lord 's Face once , then ?
Sir , for these things I shall do well enough ,
There is no fear of me .
But then , my Wife is
Such an untoward thing ! she 'll never learn
How to comport with it ! I am out of all
Conceit , on her behalf .
Best have her taught , Sir .
Where ?
Are there any Schools for Ladies ?
Is there
An Academy for Women ?
I do know ,
For Men , there was : I learn 'd in it my self ,
To make my Legs , and do my Postures .
Sir ,
Do you remember the conceit you had ? ?
O' the Spanish Gown , at home ?
turns to Fitz-dottrel .
Ha ! I do thank thee ,
With all my Heart , dear Ingine .
Sir , there is
A certain Lady , here about the Town ,
An English Widow , who hath lately travel 'd ,
But she 's call 'd the Spaniard , cause she came
Latest from thence : and keeps the Spanish habit .
Such a rare woman ! all our women here ,
That are of spirit and fashion , flock unto her ,
As to their President ; their Law , their Canon ;
More than they ever did to Oracle-Foreman .
Such rare Receits she has , Sir , for the Face ;
Such Oils , such Tinctures , such Pomatum 's ,
Such Perfumes , Medicines , Quintessences , &c .
And such a Mistris of behaviour ,
She knows from the Dukes Daughter , to the Doxey ,
VVhat is their due just : and no more ! Fit .
O Sir !
You please me i' this , more than mine own greatness .
VVhere is she ?
Let us have her .
By you patience ,
VVe must use means ; cast how to be acquainted ?
Good , Sir , about it .
We must think how , first .
O !
I do not love to tarry for a thing ,
VVhen I have a mind to't .
You do not know me ,
If you do offer it .
Your Wife must send
Some pretty token to her , with a complement ,
And pray to be receiv 'd in her good Graces ,
All the great Ladies do 't .
She shall , she shall ,
VVhat were it best to be ?
Some little Toy ,
I would not have it any great matter , Sir :
A Diamond Ring , of forty or fifty Pound ,
VVould do it handsomly : and be a gift
Fit for your Wife to send , and her to take .
I 'll go , and tell my VVife on't , straight .
VVhy this
Is well ! The Clothes we ' have now ; But , where 's this
Lady ?
If we could get a witty Boy now , Ingine ;
That were an excellent crack .
I could instruct him ,
To the true height .
For any thing takes this Dottrel .
Why , Sir , your best will be one o ' the Players !
No, there 's no trusting them .
They 'll talk on't ,
And tell their Poets .
What if they do ?
the Jest
Will brook the Stage .
But , there be some of 'em
Are very honest Lads .
There 's Dick Robinson
A very pretty Fellow , and comes often
To a Gentleman 's Chamber , a Friends of mine .
We had
The merriest Supper of it there , one night ,
The Gentleman 's Landlady invited him
To
To'a Gossips Feast : Now , he Sir , brought Dick Robinson ,
Drest like a Lawyers Wife , amongst 'em all ;
( I lent him Cloathes ) but , to see him behave it ;
And lay the Law , and carve , and drink unto 'em ;
And then talk Baudy : and send Frolicks ! O !
It would have burst your Buttons , or not left you
A Seam .
They say he 's an ingenious Youth !
O Sir ! and dresses himself the best ! beyond
Forty o ' your very Ladies ! did you nee 'r see him ?
No, I do seldom see those Toys .
But think you ,
That we may have him ?
Sir , the young Gentleman
I tell you of , can command him .
Shall I attempt it ?
Yes , do it .
' Slight , I cannot get my Wife
To part with a Ring , on any terms : and yet
The sullen Monkey has two .
It were 'gainst Reason ,
That you should urge it ; Sir , send to a Goldsmith ,
Let not her lose by 't .
How do 's she lose by 't ?
Is't not for her ?
Make it your own bounty ,
It will ha' the better success ; what is a matter
Of fifty Pound to you , Sir . Fit .
I ' have but a hundred
Pieces , to shew here ; that I would not break ?
You shall ha' credit , Sir . I 'll send a Ticket
Unto my Goldsmith .
Here , my Man comes too ,
To carry it fitly .
How now , Trains ?
VVhat Birds ?
Your Cousin Ever-ill met me , and has beat me ,
Because I would not tell him where you were :
I think he has dog 'd me to the House too .
Well ?
You shall go out at the back-door then , Trains .
You must get Guilt-head hither , by some means .
' Tis impossible !
Tell him , we have Venison ,
I 'll g ' him a piece , and send his Wife a Pheasant .
A forrest moves not , till that forty Pound ,
Yo ' had of him last be paid .
He keeps more stir
For that same petty summ , than for your Bond
Of Six ; and Statute of Eight hundred ! Fit .
Tell him
VVe 'll hedge in that .
Cry up Fitz-dottrel to him ,
Double his price : Make him a Man of mettal .
That will not need , his Bond is currant enough .
I 'll have you learn , Son .
Wherefore have I plac 'd
you
VVith Sir Poul Either-side , but have so much Law
To keep your own ?
Besides , he is a Justice ,
Here i' the Town ; and dwelling , Son , with him ,
You shall learn that in a Year , shall be worth twenty
Of having staid you at Oxford , or at Cambridge ,
Or sending you to the Inns of Court , or France .
I am call 'd for now in haste , by Master Mere-craft
To trust Master Fitz-dottrel , a good Man :
I ' have inquire 'd him eighteen hundred a Year ,
( His name is currant ) for a Diamond Ring
Of forty , shall not be worth thirty ( that 's gain 'd )
And this is to make you a Gentleman !
O , but good Father , you trust too much !
Boy , by ,
VVe live by finding Fools out to be trusted .
Our Shop-books are our Pastures , our Corn-grounds ,
VVe lay 'em op'n , for them to come into :
And when we have 'em there , we drive 'em up
In t ' one of our Pounds , the Compters , straight ,
And this is to make you a Gentleman !
VVe Citizens never trust , but we do cozen :
For , if our Debtors pay , we cozen them ;
And if they do not , then we cozen our selves .
But that 's a hazard every one must run ,
That hopes to make his Son a Gentleman !
I do not wish to be one , truly Father .
In a descent , or two , we come to be
Just 'i their State , fit to be cozen 'd , like 'em .
And I had rather ha' tarried i' your Trade :
For , since the Gentry scorn the City so much ,
Methinks we should in time , holding together ,
And matching in our own Tribes , as they say ,
That confounds all .
And makes a Mungril breed , Father .
And when they have your Money , then they laugh
at you :
Or kick you down the Stairs .
I cannot abide 'em .
I would fain have 'em cozen 'd , but not trusted .
Welcome , good Guilt-head , I must ha' you do
A noble Gentleman a courtesie , here ,
In a meer toy ( some pretty Ring , or Jewel )
Of fifty , or threescore Pound .
( Make it a hundred ,
And hedge in the last forty , that I owe you ,
And your own price for the Ring . )
He 's a good Man , Sir ,
And you may hap ' see him a great one ! He ,
Is likely to bestow hundreds , and thousands ,
Wi' you ; if you can humour him .
A great Prince
He will be shortly .
VVhat do you say ?
In truth , Sir ,
I cannot .
' T has been a long vacation with us .
Of what , I pray thee ?
of Wit ?
or Honesty ?
Those are your Citizens long vacations .
Good Father do not trust 'em .
Nay , Thom .
Guilt-head ,
He will not buy a courtesie and beg it :
He 'll rather pay than pray .
If you do for him ,
You must do cheerfully .
His credit , Sir ,
Is not yet prostitute ! VVho 's this ?
thy Son ?
A pretty Youth , what 's his name ?
Plutarchus , Sir .
Plutarchus ! How came that about ?
That Year , Sir ,
That I begot him , I bought Plutarch 's Lives ,
And fell s ' in love with the Book , as I call 'd my Son
By 'his name , in hope he should be like him :
And write the Lives of our great Men ! Mer .
i' the City ?
And you do breed him , there ?
His mind , Sir , lies
Much to that way .
VVhy , then he is i' the right way .
But , now , I had rather get him a good VVife ,
And plant him i' the Country ; there to use
The blessing I shall leave him .
Out upon't !
And lose the laudable means , thou hast at home , here ,
T' advance , and make him a young Alderman ?
Buy him a Captains place , for shame ; and let him
Into the World early , and with his Plume ,
And Scarfs , march through Cheapside , or along Cornhill ;
And by the vertue ' of those , draw down a VVife
There from a Windo' , worth ten thousand Pound !
Get him the posture Book , and 's Leaden Men ,
To set upon a Table , 'gainst his Mistris
Chance to come by , that he may draw her in ,
And shew her Finsbnry Battels .
I have plac 'd him
With Justice Eitherside , to get so much Law .
?
As thou hast Conscience .
Come , come , thou
dost wrong
Pretty Plutarchus , who had not his name ,
For nothing : but was born to train the Youth
Of London in the Military truth ? ? ?
That way his Genius lies .
My Cousin Everill !
'pray you let us whisper .
Father , dear Father , trust him if you love me .
Why , I do mean it , Boy ; but , what I do ,
Must not come easily from me : We must deal
With Courtiers , Boy , as Courtiers deal with us .
If I have a Business there , with any of them ,
Why , I must wait , I'am sure on't , Son : and though
My Lord dispatch me , yet his worshipful Man ? ?
Will keep me for his sport , a Month , or two ,
To shew me with my fellow Citizens .
I must make his Train long , and full , one quarter ;
And help the spectacle of his greatness .
There ,
Nothing is done at once , but injuries , Boy :
And they come head-long ! all their good turns move not ,
Or very slowly .
Yet sweet Father , trust him .
Well , I will think .
Come , you must do 't , Sir .
I'am undone else , and your Lady Tail-bush .
Has sent for me to dinner , and my Cloaths
Are all at pawn .
I had sent out this morning ,
Before I heard you were come to Town , some twenty
Of my Epistles , and no one return ?
Why , I ha' told you o ' this .
This comes of
wearing
Scarlet , Gold-lace , and Cut-works ! your fine Gartring !
With your blown Roses , Cousin ! and your eating
Pheasant , and Godwit , here in London ! haunting
The Globes , and Mermaides ! wedging in with Lords ,
Still at the Table ! and affecting Lechery ,
In Velvet ! where could you ha' contented your self
With Cheese , salt Butter , and a pickled Herring ,
I ' the Low-countries ; there worn Cloth , and Fustian !
Been satisfied with a leap o ' your Host 's Daughter ,
In Garison , a Wench of a Stoter ! or ,
Your Sutlers Wife , i' the Leaguer , of two Blanks !
You never then had run upon this flat ,
To write your Letters missive , and send out
Your privy Seals , that thus have frighted off
All your acquaintance ; that they shun you at distance ,
Worse than you do the Bailies ! Ever .
Pox upon you ,
I come not to you for Counsel , I lack Money .
You do not think , what you owe me already .
I?They owe you , that mean to pay you .
I 'll besworn
I never meant it .
Come , you will project ,
I shall undo your practice , for this Month else :
You know me .
I , yo ' are a right sweet nature !
Well , that 's all one !
You 'll leave this Empire one day ?
You will not ever have this Tribute paid ,
Your Scepter o ' the Sword ?
Tie up your wit ,
Do , and provoke me not ? ?
Will you , Sir , help
To what I shall provoke another for you ?
I cannot tell ; try me : I think I am not
So utterly , of an ore un-to-be-melted ,
But I can do my self good , on occasions .
Strike in then , for your part , Mr. Fitz-dottrel ,
If I transgress in point of Manners , afford me
Your best construction ; I must beg my freedom
From your affairs , this day .
How , Sir . Mer .
It is
In succour of this Gentlemans occasions ,
My Kinsman ? ?
You 'll not do me that affront , Sir .
I am sorry you should so interpret it ,
But , Sir , it stands upon his being invested
In a new Office , he has stood for , long :
Master of the Dependances ! A place
Of my projection too , Sir , and hath met
Much opposition ; but the State , now , see 's
That great necessity of it , as after all
Their writing , and their speaking , against Duels ,
They have erected it .
His Book is drawn ? ?
For , since , there will be differences daily ,
' Twixt Gentlemen ; and that the roaring manner
Is grown offensive ; that those few , we call
The civil Men o ' the Sword , abhor the Vapours ;
They shall refer now , hither , for their Process ;
And such as trespass 'gainst the Rule of Court ,
Are to be fin 'd ?
In troth , a pretty place !
A kind of Arbitrary Court 'twill be , Sir .
I shall have matter for it , I believe ,
Ere it be long : I had a distaste .
But now , Sir ,
My learned Counsel , they must have a feeling ,
They 'll part , Sir , with no Books , without the Hand-gout
Be oil 'd ; and I must furnish .
If 't be Money ,
To me straight .
I am Mine , Mint and Exchequer ,
To supply all .
What is't ?
a hundred Pound ?
No, th ' Harpey , now , stands on a hundred Pieces .
Why , he must have 'em , if he will .
To mor-
row , Sir ,
Will equally serve your occasion 's , ? ? ?
And therefore , let me obtain , that you will yield
To timing a poor Gentlemans distresses ,
In terms of hazard .
?
By no means ! Mer .
I must
Get him this Money , and will .
Sir , I protest ,
I 'd rather stand engag 'd for it my self :
Then you should leave me .
O good Sir , do you think
So coursly of our manners , that we would ,
For any need of ours , be prest to take it :
Though you be pleas 'd to offer it .
Why , by Heaven ,
I mean it ! Mer .
I can never believe less .
But we , Sir , must preserve our Dignity ,
As you do publish yours .
By your fair leave , Sir .
As I am a Gentleman , if you do offer
To leave me now , or if you do refuse me ,
I will not think you love me .
Sir , I honour you .
And with just reason , for these noble Notes ,
Of the Nobility , you pretend too ! But , Sir ?
I would know , why ?
a motive ( he a stranger )
You should do this ?
You 'll mar all with your fineness )
Why , that 's all one , if 'twere , Sir , but my fancy .
But I have a Business , that perhaps I 'd have
Brought to his Office .
O , Sir ! I have done , then ;
If he can be made profitable to you .
Yes , and it shall be one of my ambitions
To have it the first Business ?
May I not ?
So you do mean to make 't a perfect Business .
Nay , I 'll do that , assure you : shew me once .
Sir , it concerns , the first be a perfect Business ,
For his own Honour ! Ever .
I , and th ' Reputation
Too , of my Place .
Why , why do I take this course , else ?
I am not altogether an Ass , good Gentlemen ,
Wherefore should I consult you ?
do you think , |
To make a Song on't ?
How 's your manner ?
tell us .
Do , satisfie him : give him the whole course .
First , by request , or otherwise , you offer
Your Business to the Court wherein you crave ;
The judgment of the Master and the Assistants .
Well , that 's done , now , what do you upon it ?
We straight , Sir , have recourse to the Spring-
head ;
Visit the Ground ; and , so disclose the nature :
If it will carry , or no .
If we do find ,
By our proportions , it is like to prove
A sullen , and black Bus'ness , that it be
Incorrigible , and out of treaty ; then ,
We file it , a Dependance ! Fit .
So 'tis fil 'd .
What follows ?
I do love the order of these things .
We then advise the party , if he be
A Man of Means , and Havings , that forth-with
He settle his Estate : if not , at least
That he pretend it .
For , by that , the World
Takes notice , that it now is a Dependance .
And this we call , Sir , Publication .
Very sufficient ! After Publication , now ?
Then we grant out our Process , which is divers ;
Either by Chartel , Sir , or Ore-tenus ,
Wherein the Challenger , and Challengee ,
Or ( with your Spaniard ) your Provocador ,
And Provocado , have their several courses ?
I have enough on't ! for an hundred Pieces ?
Yes , for two hundred , under-write me , do .
Your Man will take my Bond ?
That he will , sure ;
But , these same Citizens , they are such sharks !
There 's an old Debt of forty , I ga' my word
For one is run away , to the Bermudas ,
And he will hook in that , or he wi' not do .
Why , let him .
That and the Ring , and a hun-
dred Pieces ,
Will all but make two hundred ?
No, no more , Sir .
What ready Arithmetick you have ?
do you hear ?
A pretty mornings work for you , this ! Do it ,
You shall ha' twenty Pound on't .
Twenty Pieces ?
Good Father , do 't . )
You will hook still ?
well ,
Shew us your Ring .
You could not ha' done this , now
With gentleness , at first , we might ha' thank 'd you ;
But groan , and ha' your courtesies come from you
Like a hard stool , and stink .
A Man may draw
Your Teeth out easier than your Money .
Come ,
Were little Guilt-head here , no better a nature ,
I should ne 'r love him , that could pull his Lips off , now !
Was not thy Mother a Gentlewoman ?
Yes , Sir .
And went to the Court at Christmas , and St .
Georges -
tide ?
And lent the Lords-men Chains !
Of Gold and Pearl , Sir .
I knew thou must take after some body !
Thou could 'st not be else .
This was no Shop-look !
I 'll ha' thee Captain Guilt-head , and march up ,
And take in Pimlico , and kill the Bush
At every Tavern ! Thou shalt have a Wife ,
If Smocks will mount , Boy .
How now ?
you ha' there
now
Some Bristo-stone , or Cornish counterfeit
You 'ld put upon us .
No, Sir , I assure you .
Look on his luster ! he will speak himself !
I 'll gi' you leave to put him i' the Mill ,
H' is no great , large Stone , but a true Paragon ,
H' has all his Corners , view him well .
H' is yellow .
Upo ' my faith , Sir , o ' the right black-water ,
And very deep ! H'is set without a foil , too .
Here 's one o ' the Yellow-water , I 'll sell cheap .
And what do you value this at ?
thirty Pound ?
No, Sir , he cost me forty , ere he was set .
Turnings , you mean ?
I know your Equivocks :
You 'are grown the better Fathers of 'em o ' late .
Well , where 't must go , 'twill be judg 'd , and therefore ,
Look you't be right .
You shall have fifty Pound for't .
Not a Deneer more ! And because you would
Have things dispatch 'd , Sir , I 'll go presently ,
Inquire out this Lady .
If you think good , Sir .
Having an hundred Pieces ready , you may
Part with those now , to serve my Kinsmans turns ,
That he may wait upon you anon , the freer ;
And take 'em when you ha' seal 'd again , of Guilt-head .
I care not if I do ! Mer .
And dispatch all
There , th'are just ; a hundred Pieces !
I ' ha' told 'em over twice a day these two Months .
and he fall to share .
Well , go and seal then , Sir , make your return
As speedy as you can .
Come , gi' me .
Soft , Sir .
Marry , and fair too , then , I 'll no delaying , Sir .
But you will hear ?
Yes , when I have my Divident .
There 's forty Pieces for you .
What is this for ?
Your half .
You know , that Guilt-head must ha'
And what 's your Ring there ?
shall I ha' none
o ' that ?
O , that 's to be given to a Lady !
Is't so ?
By that good light , it is .
Come , gi' me
Ten Pieces more , then .
Why ?
For Guilt-head ?
Sir ,
Do ' you think , I 'll allow him any such share ?
You must .
Must I ?
Do your musts , Sir , I 'll do mine ;
You wi' not part with the whole , Sir , will you ?
Go too .
Gi' me ten Pieces ! Mer .
By what Law do you this ?
E'en Lyon-law , Sir , I must roar else .
Good !
Yo ' have heard how th ' Ass made his divisions
wisely ?
And I am he : I thank you .
Much good do you , Sir .
I shall be rid o ' this Tyranny one day .
Not
While you do eat , and lie about the Town here ,
And cozen i' your Bullions ; and I stand
Your name of Credit , and compound your business ;
Adjourn your beatings every Term , and make
New Parties for your projects .
I have now
A pretty task of it , to hold you in
Wi' your Lady Tail bush : but the toy will be ,
How we shall both come off ?
Leave you your doubting ,
And do your portion , what 's assign 'd you : I
Never fail 'd yet .
With reference to your aids ?
You 'll still be unthankful .
Where shall I meet you , anon ?
You ha' some feat to do alone , now , I see ;
You wish me gone , well , I will find you out ,
And bring you after to the Audit .
' Slight !
There 's Ingine 's share too , I had forgot ! This Reign
Is too-too-unsupportable ! I must
Quit my self of this Vassalage ! Ingine ! welcome .
Excellent well !
Will 't d o ?
Where 's Robinson ?
Here is the Gentleman , Sir ,
Will undertake 't himself .
I have acquainted him .
Why did you so ?
Why , Robinson would ha' told him ,
You know .
And he 's a pleasant Wit ! will hurt
Nothing you purpose .
Then , he 's of Opinion ,
That Robinson might want audacity ,
She being such a Gallant .
Now , he has been
In Spain , and knows the Fashions there ; and can
Discourse ; and being but mirth ( he says ) leave much
To his care .
But he is too tall !
his Stature .
For that ,
He has the bravest Device (you 'll love him for't )
To say , he wears Cioppinos : and they do so
In Spain .
And Robinson 's as tall as he .
Is he so ?
Every jot .
Nay , I had rather
To trust a Gentleman with it o ' the two .
Pray you go to him then , Sir , and salute him .
Sir , my Friend Ingine has acquainted you
With a strange business , here .
A merry one , Sir .
The Duke of Drown 'd-Land , and his Dutchess ?
Yes , Sir .
Now , that the Conjurers ha' laid him by ,
I ha' made bold to borrow him a while .
With purpose , yet , to put him out I hope
To his best use .
Yes , Sir . Wit .
For that small part ,
That I am trusted with , put off your care :
I would not lose to do it , for the mirth
Will follow of it ; and well , I have a fancy .
Sir , that will make it well .
You will report it so .
Where must I have my dressing ?
At my House , Sir .
You shall have caution , Sir , for what he yields ,
To six Pence .
You shall pardon me .
I will share , Sir ,
I ' your Sports , only : nothing i' your purchace .
But you must furnish me with Complements ,
To th ' manner of Spain ; my Coach , my guarda duenna 's ;
Ingine 's your Pro 'vedor .
But , Sir , I must
( Now I ' have entred trust wi' you , thus far )
Secure still i' your Quality , acquaint you
With somewhat beyond this .
The Place design 'd
At the Lady-Tailbushes .
I know her , Sir ,
And her Gentleman huisher .
Mr. Ambler ?
Yes , Sir .
Sir , It shall be no shame to me , to confess
To you , that we poor Gentlemen , that want Acres ,
Must for our needs , turn Fools up , and plough Ladies
Sometime , to try what gleb they are : and this
Is no unfruitful Piece .
She and I now
Are on a Project , for the Fact , and venting
Of a new kind of Fucus ( paint for Ladies )
To serve the Kingdom : wherein she her self
Hath travaill 'd , specially , by way of Service
Unto her Sex , and hopes to get the Monopoly ,
As the Reward of her Invention .
What is her end in this ?
Merely Ambition ,
Sir , to grow great , and court it with the Secret :
Though she pretend some other .
For , she 's dealing ,
Already , upon caution for the shares ,
And Mr. Ambler , is he nam 'd Examiner
For the Ingredients ; and the Register
Of what is vented ; and shall keep the Office .
Now , if she break with you , of this ( as I
Must make the leading Thred to your acquaintance ,
That , how Experience gotten i' your Being
Abroad , will help our Business ) think of some
Pretty Additions , but to keep her floating :
It may be she will offer you a Part ,
Any strange Names of ?
Sir , I have my Instructions .
Is it not high time to be making ready ?
Yes , Sir . Ing .
The Fool 's in sight , Dottrel .
Away , then .
Yes , here 's the Ring : I ha'
But there 's not so much Gold in all the Row , he says ?
Till 't come fro ' the Mint .
' Tis tane up for the Gamesters .
There 's a Shop-shift ! plague on 'em .
He do 's swear it .
He 'll swear and forswear too , it is his Trade ,
You should not have left him .
' Slid , I can go back ,
And beat him yet .
No, now let him alone .
I was so earnest , after the main Business ,
To have this Ring gone .
True , and 'tis time .
I ' have learn 'd , Sir , Sin' you went , her Ladyship eats
With the Lady Tail-bush , here , hard by .
I ' the Lane here ?
Yes , if you had a Servant , now of Presence ,
Well cloath 'd , and of an airy voluble Tongue ,
Neither too big or little for his Mouth ,
That could deliver your Wives Complement ;
To send along withal .
I have one Sir ,
A very handsom Gentleman-like-fellow ,
That I do mean to make my Dutchess Usher ?
I entertain 'd him but this Morning too :
I 'll call him to you .
The worst of him is his Name !
She 'll take no note of that , but of his Message .
Devil ! How like you him , Sir . Pace , go a little ,
Let 's see you move .
He 'll serve , Sir , give it him :
And let him go along with me , I 'll help
To present him and it .
Look you do Sirrah ,
Discharge this well , as you expect your Place .
D'you hear , go on , come off with all your Honours .
I would fain see him do it .
Trust him with it .
Remember kissing of your Hand , and answering
With the French time , in flexure of your Body .
I could now so instruct him ?
and for his words ?
I 'll put them in his Mouth .
O , but I have 'em ;
O' the very Academies .
Sir , you 'll have use for 'em
Anon your self , I warrant you , after Dinner
When you are call 'd .
' Slight , that 'll be just Play-time .
It cannot be , I must not lose the Play !
Sir , but you must , if she appoint to sit .
And she 's President .
' Slid , it is the Devil !
And , 'twere his Damm too , you must now apply
Your self , Sir , to this wholly ; or lose all .
If I could but see a Piece ?
Sir , Never think on't .
Keep him in awe ! Mer .
But say that he be one
Wi' not be aw 'd ! but laugh at you .
How then ?
That he shall pay for 's Dinner himself .
Perhaps ,
He would do that twice , rather than thank you .
Come get the Devil out of your Head , my Lord ,
( I 'll call you so in private still ) and take
Your Lordship i' your mind .
You were , sweet Lord ,
In talk to bring a Business to the Office .
P p p Mer .
Why
Why should not you , Sir , carry it o ' your self ,
Before the Office be up ?
and shew the World ,
You had no need of any mans direction ;
In Point , Sir , of sufficiency ?
I speak
Against a Kinsman , but as one that tenders
Your Graces good .
I thank you ; to proceed ?
To Publications : ha' your Deed drawn presently .
And leave me a blank to put in your Feoffees ,
One , two , or more , as you see cause ?
I thank you
Heartily , I do thank you .
Not a word more ,
I pray you , as you love me .
Let me alone .
That I could not think o ' this as well as he ?
O , I could beat my infinite Block-head ?
Come , we must this way .
How far is't ?
Hard by here ,
Over the way .
Now , to atchieve this Ring
From this same Fellow , that is to assure it ,
Before he give it .
Though my Spanish Lady ,
Be a young Gentleman of means , and scorn
To share , as he doth say , I do not know
How such a Toy may tempt his Ladiship :
And therefore , I think best it be assur 'd .
Sir , be the Ladies brave we go unto ?
O , yes .
And shall I see 'em , and speak
to 'em ?
What else ?
ha' you your False-beard about
you , Trains ?
And is this one of your double
Clokes ?
The best of 'em .
Be ready then .
Sweet Pitfall !
I 'll set thee up again .
Never fear that : canst thou get ne 'er a Bird ?
No Thrushes hungry ?
Stay till cold Weather come ,
I 'll help thee to an Ousel or a Field-fare .
Who 's within with Madam ?
I 'll tell you straight .
Please you stay here a while , Sir , I 'll go in .
I do so long to have a little Venery ,
While I am in this Body ! I would taste
Of every Sin a little , if it might be ,
After the manner of Man ! Sweet-heart !
What would you , Sir ?
Nothing but fall in , to you , be your Black-bird ,
My pretty Pit ( as the Gentleman said ) your Throstle :
Lye tame and taken with you ; here is Gold !
To buy you so much new Stuffs from the Shop ,
As I may take the old up ? ?
You must send , Sir ,
The Gentleman the Ring .
There 'tis .
Nay look ,
Message , and gets the Ring .
Will you be foolish , Pit ?
This is strange rudeness .
Dear Pit .
I 'll call , I swear .
Where are you , Sir ?
Is your Ring ready ?
Go with me .
I sent it you .
Me ?
When ?
by whom ?
A Fellow here , e 'en now ,
Came for it i' your Name .
I sent none , sure .
My meaning ever was , you shonld deliver it
Your self : So was your Masters charge , you know .
Trains as himself again .
What Fellow was it , do you know him ?
Here ,
But now , he had it .
Saw you any , Trains ?
Not I.
The Gentleman saw him .
I was so earnest upon her , I mark 'd not !
My devillish Chief has put me here in Flesh ,
To shame me ! This dull Body I am in ,
I perceive nothing with ! I offer at nothing
That will succeed ! Tra .
Sir , she saw none , she says .
Satan himself has tane a shape t ' abuse me .
It could not be else ! Mer .
This is above strange !
That you should be so retchless .
What 'll you do , Sir ?
How you will answer this , when you are question 'd ?
Run from my Flesh , if I could : put off Mankind !
That 's such a scorn ! and will be a new Exercise
For my Arch-Duke ! Woe to the several Cudgels ,
Must suffer on this back ! Can you no Succours , Sir ?
Alas ! the use of it is so present .
I ask ,
Sir , Credit for another , but till to morrow .
There is not so much time , Sir . But however ,
The Lady is a noble Lady , and will
( To save a Gentleman from check ) be intreated
To say , she has receiv 'd it .
Pug , Do you think so ?
Will she be won ?
No doubt , to such an Office ,
It will be a Ladies Bravery and her Pride .
And not be known on't after , unto him ?
That were a Treachery ! Upon my word ,
Be confident .
Return unto your Master ,
My Lady President sits this Afternoon ,
Has tane the Ring , commends her Services
Unto your Lady-Dutchess .
You may say
She 's a civil Lady , and does give her
All her respects already : Bad you tell her ,
She lives but to receive her wish 'd Commandments ,
And have the honour here to kiss her Hands :
For which she 'll stay this hour yet .
Hasten you
Your Prince , away .
And Sir , you will take care
Th' excuse be perfect ?
You confess your fears .
Too much .
The Shame is more , I 'll quit you of either .
I ' had rather hear that it were past the Seals :
You Courtiers move so Snail-like i' your Business .
Would I had not begun wi' you .
We must move ,
Madam , in order , by degrees : not jump .
Why , there was Sir John Monie-man could jump
A Business quickly .
True , he had great Friends ,
But , because some , sweet Madam , can leap Ditches ,
We must not all shun to go over Bridges .
The harder Parts , I make account are done ,
Now 'tis referr 'd .
You are infinitly bound
Unto the Ladies , they ha' so cri 'd it up !
Do they like it then ?
The ha' sent the Spanish Lady ,
To gratulate with you ?
I must send 'em thanks ,
And some Remembrances .
That you must , and visit 'em .
Where 's Ambler ?
Lost , to day , we cannot hear of him .
Not , Madam ?
No in good faith .
They say he lay not
At home to night .
And here has fall 'n a Business
Between your Cousin , and Master Manly , has
Unquieted us all .
So I hear , Madam .
Pray you how was it ?
Troth , it but appears
Ill
Ill o ' your Kinsmans part .
You may have heard ,
That Manly is a Sutor to me , I doubt not .
I guess 'd it , Madam .
And it seems , he trusted
Your Cousin to let fall some fair reports
Of him unto me , Mer .
Which he did ! Tay .
So far
From it , as he came in , and took him rayling
Against him .
How ! And what said Manly to him ?
Enough , I do assure you : and with that scorn
Of him , and the Injury , as I do wonder
How Everil bore it ! But that guilt undoes
Many Mens Valours .
Here comes Manly .
Madam , I 'll take my leave ? ? ?
You sha' not go , i' faith .
I 'll ha' you stay , and see this Spanish Miracle ,
Of our English Lady .
Let me pray your Ladiship ,
Lay your Commands on me some other time .
Now , I protest : and I will have all piec'd
And Friends again .
It will be but ill solder 'd !
You are too much affected with it .
I cannot
Madam , but think on't for th ' Injustice .
Sir ,
His Kinsman here is sorry .
Not I , Madam ,
I am no kin to him , we but call Cousins ;
And if we were , Sir , I have no relation
Unto his Crimes .
You are not urged with 'em .
I can accuse , Sir , none but mine own Judgment ,
For though it were his Crime , so to betray me ,
I ' am sure , 'twas more mine own , at all to trust him :
But he therein , did use but his old Manners ,
And favour strongly what he was before .
Come , he will change !
Faith , I must never think it .
Nor were it reason in me to expect ,
That for my sake , he should put off a Nature
He suck 'd in with his Milk .
It may be Madam ,
Deceiving trust , is all he has to trust to :
If so , I shall be loth , that any hope
Of mine , should bate him of his means .
Yo ' are sharp , Sir .
Welcom , dear Eitherside ! how hast thou done , good
Wench ?
Thou hast been a stranger ! I ha' not seen thee this Week .
Where hast thou been ?
I did so long to see thee .
Visiting , and so tyr 'd !
I protest , Madam , 'tis a monstrous trouble !
And so it is .
I swear I must to morrow ,
Begin my Visits ( would they were over ) at Court .
It tortures me , to think on 'em .
I do hear
You ha' cause , Madam , your Suit goes on .
Who told thee ?
One that can tell : Mr. Eitherside .
O , thy Husband !
Yes faith , there 's Life in't , now : It is referr 'd .
If we once see it under the Seals Wench , then ,
Have with 'em for the great Carroch , Six Horses ,
And the two Coachmen , with my Ambler , bare ,
And my three Women ; we will live i' faith ,
The Examples o ' the Town , and govern it .
I 'll lead the Fashion still .
You do that now ,
Sweet Madam .
O , but then , I 'll every day
Bring up some new Device .
Thou and I , Eitherside ,
Will first be in it , I will give it thee ;
And they shall follow us .
Thou shalt , I swear ,
Wear every Month a new Gown out of it .
Thank you , good Madam .
Pray thee call me Tail-bush ,
As I thee Eitherside ; I not love this , Madam .
Then I protest to you , Tail-bush , I am glad
Your Business so succeeds .
Thank thee , good Eitherside .
But Master Eitherside tells me , that he likes
Your other Business better .
Which ?
O' the Tooth-picks .
I never heard on't .
Ask Mr. Merecraft .
Madam ?
H'is one , in a word , I 'll trust his Malice ,
With any man 's Credit , I would have abus 'd !
Sir , if you think you do please me , in this ,
You are deceiv 'd ! Mer .
No, but because my Lady
Nam 'd him my Kinsman ; I would satisfie you
What I think of him : and pray you upon it
To judge me ! Man .
So I do : that ill mens Friendship ,
Is as unfaithful as themselves .
Do you hear ?
Ha' you a Business about Tooth-picks .
Yes , Madam .
Did I ne 'r tell 't you ?
I meant to have offer 'd it
Your Ladiship , on the perfecting the Patent .
How is't ! Mer .
For serving the whole State
with Tooth-picks ;
( Somewhat an intricate Business to discourse ) but ?
I show how much the Subject is abus 'd ,
First , in that one Commodity ?
then what Diseases
And Putrefactions in the Gums are bred ,
By those are made of adultrate and false Wood ?
My Plot , for Reformation of these follows .
To have all Toothpicks brought unto an Office ,
There seal 'd ; and such as counterfeit 'em mulcted .
And last , for venting 'em , to have a Book
Printed , to teach their use , which every Child
Shall have throughout the Kingdom that can read ,
And learn to pick his Teeth by .
Which beginning
Early to Practice , with some other Rules ,
Of never sleeping with the Mouth open , chawing
Some Grains of Mastick , will preserve the Breath
Pure and so free from taint ?
ha' what is't , sai 'st thou ?
Good faith , it sounds a very pretty Business !
So Mr. Eitherside says , Madam .
The Lady is come .
Is she ?
Good , wait upon her in .
My Ambler
Was never so ill absent .
Eitherside ,
How do I look to day ?
Am I not drest ,
Spruntly ?
Yes verily , Madam .
Pox o ' Madam ,
Will you not leave that ?
Yes , good Tailbush .
So ?
Sounds not that better ?
What vile Fucus is this
Thou hast got on ?
' Tis Pearl .
Pearl ?
Oyster-shells :
As I breath Eitherside I know't .
Here comes
( They say ) a wonder , Sirrah , has been in Spain !
Will teach us all ! she 's sent to me from Court ,
To gratulate with me ! Prythee let 's observe her ,
What faults she has , that we may laugh at 'em ,
When she is gone .
That we will heartily , Tail-bush .
O , me ! the very Infanta of the Giants !
Wittipol , drest like a Spanish Lady .
Here is a noble Lady , Madam , come ,
From your great Friends , at Court , to see your
Ladiship :
And have the Honour of your Acquaintance .
She do 's us Honour .
Pray you , say to her Ladiship ,
It is the manner of Spain to imbrace only ,
Never to kiss .
She will excuse the Custom !
Your use of it is Law .
Please you sweet Madam ,
To take a Seat .
Yes , Madam .
I ' have had
The favour , through a World of fair report
To know your Vertues , Madam ; and in that
Name , have desir 'd the happiness of presenting
My Service to your Ladiship ! Tay .
Your Love , Madam ,
I must not own it else .
Both are due , Madam ,
To your great Undertakings .
Great ?
In troth , Madam ,
They are my Friends , that think 'em any thing :
If I can do my Sex ( by 'em ) any Service ,
I ' have my ends , Madam .
And they are noble ones ,
That make a Multitude beholden , Madam :
The Commonwealth of Ladies , must acknowledge from you .
Except some envious , Madam .
Yo ' are right in that , Madam ,
Of which Race , I encountred some but lately .
Who ( 't seems ) have studyed Reasons to discredit
Your Business .
How , sweet Madam .
Nay , the Parties
Wi' not be worth your pause ?
Most ruinous things ,
Madam ,
That have put off all hope of being recover 'd
To a degree of handsomness .
But their Reasons , Madam ?
I would fain hear .
Some Madam , I remember .
They say , that painting quite destroys the Face ?
O , that 's an old one , Madam ,
There are new ones , too .
Corrupts the Breath ; hath left so little sweetness
In kissing , as 'tis now us 'd but for Fashion :
And shortly will be taken for a Punishment .
Decays the Fore-teeth that should guard the Tongue ;
And suffers that run Riot everlasting !
And ( which is worse ) some Ladies when they meet
Cannot be merry and laugh , but they do spit
In one anothers Faces ! Man .
I should know
This Voyce and Face too :
Then , they say , 'tis dangerous
To all the faln , yet well dispos 'd Mad-dams ,
That are industrious , and desire to earn
Their Living with their Sweat ! For any Distemper
Of heat and motion , may displace the Colours ;
And if the Paint once run about their Faces ,
Twenty to one , they will appear so ill-favour 'd ,
Their Servants run away too , and leave the Pleasure
Imperfect , and the Reckoning als ' unpay 'd .
Pox , these are Poets Reasons .
Some old Lady
That keeps a Poet , has devis 'd these Scandals .
Faith we must have the Poets banish 'd , Madam ,
As Master Either-side says .
Master Fitz-Dottrel ?
And his Wife : where ?
Madam , the Duke of Drown 'd-land ,
That will be shortly .
Is this my Lord ?
The same .
YOur Servant Madam !
How now ?
Friend ?
offended ,
That I have found your haunt here ?
Wittipol whispers with Manly .
No, but wondring
At your strange fashion 'd venture , hither .
It is
To shew you what they are you so pursue .
I think 'twill prove a Med'cine against marriage ;
To know their manners .
Stay , and profit then .
The Lady , Madam , whose Prince has brought
her here ,
To be instructed .
Please you sit with us , Lady .
That 's Lady-President .
A goodly Woman !
I cannot see the Ring , though .
Sir , she has it .
But , Madam , these are very feeble Reasons !
So I urg 'd Madam , that the new Complexion ,
Now to come forth , in name o ' your Ladiship 's fucus ,
Had no Ingredient ?
But I durst eat , I assure you .
So do they in Spain .
Sweet Madam be so liberal ,
To give us some o ' your Spanish Fucusees !
They are infinite , Madam .
So I .hear ,
they have
Water of Gourdes , of Radish , the white Beans ,
Flowers of Glass , of Thistles , Rose-marine ,
Raw Honey , Mustard-seed , and Bread dough-bak 'd ,
The Crums o ' Bread , Goats-milk , and Whites of Eggs ,
Campheere , and Lilly-roots , the Fat of Swans ,
Marrow of Veal , white Pidgeons , and Pine-kernels ,
The Seeds of Nettles , Purse 'line , and Hares-gall ;
Limons , Thin-skin 'd ?
How , her Ladiship has studied
All excellent things ! Wit .
But ordinary , Madam .
No, the true Rarities , are th ' Alvagada ,
And Argentata of Queen Isabella !
I , what are their Ingredients , gentle Madam ?
Your Allum Scagliola , or Pol-dipedra ;
And Zuccarino ; Turpentine of Abbezzo ,
Wash 'd in nine Waters : Soda di levante ,
Or your Fern Ashes ; Benjamin di gotta :
Grasso di serpe ; Porcelletto marino ;
Oyls of Lentisco ; Zucche Mugia ; make
The admirable Vernish for the Face ,
Gives the right Luster ; but two drops rub 'd on
With a piece of Scarlet , makes a Lady of Sixty
Look at Sixteen .
But above all , the Water
Of the white Hen , of the Lady Estifanias !
O , I , that same , good Madam , I have heard of :
How is it done ?
Madam , you take your Hen ,
Plume it , and skin it , cleanse it o ' the Inwards ;
Then chop it , bones and all : add to four Ounces
Of Carravicins , Pipitas , Sope of Cyprus ,
Make the Decoction , strein it .
Then distil it ,
And keep it in your Galley-pot well glidder 'd :
Three drops preserves from Wrinkles , Warts , Spots , Moles ,
Blemish , or Sun-burnings , and keeps the Skin
In decimo sexto , ever bright and smooth ,
As any Looking-glass ; and indeed , is call 'd
The Virgins Milk for the Face , Oglio reale ;
A Ceruse , neither cold or heat , will hurt ;
And mixt with Oyl of Myrrh , and the red Gilliflower ,
Call 'd Cataputia ; and Flowers of Rovistico ,
Makes the best Muta , or dye of the whole World .
Dear Madam , will you let us be familiar ?
Your Ladiships Servant .
How do you like her .
Admirable !
But , yet , I cannot see the Ring .
Sir . Mer .
I must
delivers it .
Deliver
Deliver it , or mar all .
This Fool 's so jealous .
Madam ?
Sir , wear this Ring , & pray you take knowledge ,
' Twas sent you by his Wife , and give her thanks .
Do not you dwindle , Sir , bear up .
I thank you , Sir .
But for the manner of Spain ! Sweet Madam , let us
Be bold , now we are in : Are all the Ladies
There i' the Fashion ?
None but Grandees , Madam ,
O' the clasp 'd Train , which may be worn at length too ,
Or thus , upon my Arm .
And do they wear
Cioppino 's all ?
If they be drest in punto , Madam .
Gilt as those are , Madam ?
Of Goldsmiths Work , Madam ;
And set with Diamonds ; and their Spanish Pumps ,
Of perfum 'd Leather .
I should think it hard
To go in 'em , Madam .
At the first it is , Madam .
Do you never fall in 'em ?
I swear , I should
Six times an hour .
But you have Men at hand still ,
To help you , if you fall ?
Only one , Madam ,
The Guardo-duenna 's , such a little old Man
As this .
Alas ! he can do nothing , this !
I 'll tell you , Madam , I saw in the Court of Spain once
A Lady fall i' the King 's sight , along ;
And there she lay , flat spread , as an Umbrella ,
Her Hoop here crack 'd ; no Man durst reach a Hand
To help her , till the Guarda-duenna 's came ,
Who is the Person onl ' allow 'd to touch
A Lady there , and he but by this Finger .
Ha' they no Servants , Madam , there , nor Friends ?
An Escudero , or so , Madam , that waits
Upon 'em in another Coach , at distance ;
And when they walk or dance , holds by a Handkercher ,
Never presumes to touch 'em .
This 's scurvy ,
And a forc 'd Gravity ! I do not like it .
I like our own much better .
' Tis more French ,
And Courtly , ours .
And tastes more Liberty .
We may have our dozen of Visitors at once
Make love t ' us .
And before our Husbands .
Husband ?
As I am honest , Tayl-bush , I do think ,
In no body should love me , but my poor Husband ,
I should e 'en hang my self .
Fortune forbid , Wench ,
So fair a Neck should have so foul a Neck-lace .
' Tis true , as I am handsom ?
I receiv 'd , Lady ,
A Token from you , which I would not be
Rude to refuse , being your first Remembrance .
O , I am satisfied now ! Mer .
Do you see it , Sir ? )
But since you come to know me nearer , Lady ,
I 'll begg the Honour you will wear it for me ,
It must be so .
Mrs. Fit .
Sure I have heard this Tongue .
What do you mean , Sir ?
Would you ha' me mercenary ?
We 'll recompence it anon , in somewhat else .
I do not love to be gull 'd , though in a Toy .
Wife , do you hear ?
yo ' are come into the School , Wife ,
Where you may learn , I do perceive it , any thing !
How to be fine , or fair , or great , or proud ,
Or what you will , indeed , Wife ; here 'tis taught :
And I am glad on't , that you may not say ,
Another day , when Honours come upon you ,
You wanted Means .
I ha' done my parts ; been ,
To day , at Fifty pound charge ; first , for a Ring ,
To get you entred ; then left my new Play ,
To wait upon you here , to see 't confirm 'd ,
That I may say , both to mine own Eyes and Ears ,
Senses , you are my Witness , she ' hath enjoy 'd
All Helps that could be had for Love or Money ?
Mrs. Fit .
To make a Fool of her .
Wife , that 's your Malice ,
The wickedness o ' your Nature , to interpret
Your Husband 's Kindness thus : but I 'll not leave
Still to do good , for your deprav 'd Affections :
Intend it ; bend this stubborn Will ; be Great .
Good Madam , whom do they use in Messages ?
They commonly use their Slaves , Madam .
And does your Ladiship
Think that so good , Madam ?
No indeed , Madam ; I
Therein prefer the Fashion of England far ,
Of your young delicate Page , or discreet Usher .
And I go with your Ladiship in opinion ,
Directly for your Gentleman-Usher ;
There 's not a finer Officer goes on Ground .
If he be made and broken to his Place once .
Nay , so I presuppose him .
And they are fitter
Managers too , Sir ; but I would have 'em call 'd
Our Escudero 's .
Say I should send
To your Ladiship , who ( I presume ) has gather 'd
All the dear Secrets , to know how to make
Pastillo 's of the Dutchess of Braganza ,
Coquetta 's , Almoiavana 's , Mantecada 's ,
Alcorea 's , Mustaccioli ; or say it were
The Peladore of Issabella , or Balls
Against the Itch , or Aqua Nanfa , or Oil
Of Jessamine for Gloves , of the Marquess Muja ;
Or for the Head and Hair ; why , these are Offices
Fit for a Gentleman , not a Slave .
They only
Might ask for your Piveti , Spanish Cole ,
To burn , and sweeten a Room : but the Arcana
Of Ladies Cabinets ?
Should be elsewhere trusted .
Yo ' are much about the truth .
Sweet honoured Ladies ,
Let me fall in wi' you .
I ha' my Female Wit ,
As well as my Male .
And I do know what suits
A Lady of Spirit , or a Woman of Fashion !
And you would have your Wife such ?
Yes , Madam , airy ,
Light ; not to plain dishonesty , I mean :
But somewhat o ' this side .
I take you , Sir .
H' has reason , Ladies .
I 'll not give this Rush
For any Lady that cannot be honest
Within a Thred .
Yes , Madam , and yet venture
As far for th ' other , in her Fame ?
As can be ;
Coach it to Pimlico , dance the Saraband ,
Hear and talk Bawdy , laugh as loud as a Larum ,
Squeak , spring , do any thing .
In young Company , Madam .
Or afore Gallants .
If they be brave , or Lords ,
A Woman is ingag 'd .
I say so , Ladies ,
It is Civility to deny us nothing .
You talk of a University ! why , Hell is
A Grammar-school to this !
But then
She must not lose a Look on Stuffs or Cloth , Madam .
Nor no course Fellow .
She must be guided , Madam ,
By the Clothes he wears , and Company he is in ,
Whom to salute , how far ?
I ha' told her this ;
And how that Bawdry too , upo ' the point ,
Is ( in it self ) as civil a Discours ? ?
As any other Affair of Flesh whatever .
But she will ne 'er be capable , she is not
So much as coming , Madam ; I know not how
She loses all her Opportunities ,
his Pug.
With hoping to be forc 'd .
I have entertain 'd
A Gentleman , a younger Brother , here ,
Whom I would fain breed up her Escudero ,
Against some Expectations that I have ,
And she 'll not countenance him .
What 's his Name ?
Devil , o ' Darby-shire .
Bless us from him ! Tay .
Devil !
Call him De-vile , sweet Madam .
Mrs. Fit .
What you please , Ladies .
Devile 's a prettier name !
And sounds , me thinks ,
As it came in with the Conqueror ?
Over smocks !
What
What things they are ?
That Nature should be at leasure
Ever to make 'em ! My Wooing is at an end .
What can he do ?
Let 's hear him .
Can he manage ?
Please you to try him , Ladies .
Stand forth , Devil .
Was all this but the Preface to my Torment ?
Come , let their Ladiships see your Honours .
O ,
He makes a wicked Leg .
As ever I saw !
Fit for a Devil .
Good Madam , call him De-vile .
De-vile , what Property is there most required
I ' your conceit now , in the Escudero ?
Why do you not speak ?
A setled discreet Pace , Madam .
I think , a barren Head , Sir , Mountain-like ,
To be expos 'd to the cruelty of Weathers ? ?
I , for his Valley is beneath the Waste , Madam ,
And to be fruitful there , it is sufficient .
Dulness upon you ! Could not you hit this ?
Good Sir ? ? ?
He then had had no barren Head .
You daw him too much , in troth , Sir . Fit .
I must walk
With the French Stick , like an old Vierger , for you .
O Chief , call me to Hell again , and free me .
Do you murmur now ?
Not I , Sir . VVit .
What do you take ,
Mr. De-vile , the height of your Employment ,
In the true perfect Escudero ?
When ?
What do you answer ?
To be able , Madam ,
First to enquire , then report the working
Of any Ladies Physick , in sweet Phrase .
To find out a good Corn-cutter .
Out on him !
Most barbarous ! Fit .
Why did you do this now ?
Of purpose to discredit me , you damn 'd Devil ?
Sure , if I be not yet , I shall be .
All
My Days in Hell were Holydays , to this !
' Tis Labour lost , Madam .
H'is a dull Fellow ,
Of no Capacity ! Tay .
Of no Discourse !
O , if my Ambler had been here ! Eit .
I , Madam ,
You talk of a Man , where is there such another ?
Mr. De-vile , put case one of my Ladies here
Had a fine Brach , and would employ you forth
To treat 'bout a convenient Match for her ,
What would you observe ?
The Colour , and the Size , Madam .
And nothing else ?
The Moon , you Calf , the Moon !
I , and the Sign .
Yes , and Receits for Proneness .
Then when the Puppies came , what would you do ?
Get their Nativities cast !
This 's well .
What more ?
Consult the Almanack-man which would be least ,
Which cleanliest .
And which silent 'st ?
This 's well , Madam :
And while she were with Puppy ?
VValk her out ,
And air her every Morning .
Very good !
And be industrious to kill her Fleas !
He will make a pretty Proficient .
VVho ,
Coming from Hell , could look for such Catechising ?
The Devil is an Ass , I do acknowledge it .
The Top of VVoman ! all her Sex in abstract !
I love her , to each Syllable falls from her .
Good Madam , give me leave to go aside with him .
And try him a little !
Do , and I 'll withdraw , Madam ,
VVith this fair Lady , read to her the while .
Come , Sir . Pug.
Dear Chief , relieve me , or I perish .
Lady , We 'll follow .
You are not jealous , Sir ?
O , Madam ! you shall see .
Stay , Wife , behold ,
I give her up here absolutely to you ;
She is your own ; do with her what you will :
Melt , cast , and form her as you shall think good :
Set any Stamp on : I 'll receive her from you
As a new thing , by your own Standard .
Well , Sir !
O , it goes on ; I met your Cousin , the Master ?
You did not acquaint him , Sir ?
Faith , but I did , Sir .
And , upon better thought , not without reason !
He being chief Officer , might ha' tane it ill else ,
As a Contempt against his Place , and that
In time , Sir , ha' drawn on another Dependance .
No, I did find him in good Terms , and ready
To do me any Service .
So he said to you ?
But , Sir , you do not know him .
Why , I presum 'd ,
Because this Bus'ness of my Wives requir 'd me ,
I could not ha' done better : And he told
Me , that he would go presently to your Counsel ,
A Knight here i' the Lane ?
Yes , Justice Either-side .
And get the Feoffment drawn , with a Letter of
Atturney ,
For Livery and Seisin .
That I know 's the Course .
But , Sir , you mean not to make him Feoffee ?
Nay , that I 'll pause on !
How now , little Pit-fall ?
Your Cousin , Master Ever-ill , would come in ?
But he would know if Mr. Manly were here .
No, tell him , if he were , I ha' made his Peace !
He 's one , Sir , has no State , and a Man knows not
How such a Trust may tempt him .
I conceive you .
Sir , this same Deed is done here .
Pretty Plutarchus !
Art thou come with it ?
and has Sir Poul view 'd it ?
His Hand is to the Draught .
Will you step in , Sir ,
And read it ?
I pray you , a word wi' you .
Sir Poul Either-side will 'd me gi' you caution
Whom you did make Feoffee ; for 'tis the Trust
O' your whole State ; and though my Cousin here
Be a worthy Gentleman , yet his Valour has
At the tall Board been question 'd ; and we hold
Any Man so impeach 'd , of doubtful Honesty !
I will not justifie this , but give it you
To make your profit of it ; if you utter it ,
I can forswear it .
I believe you , and thank you , Sir .
To Love , not Violence , here : I am no Ravisher ,
But one whom you by your fair Trust again
May of a Servaut make a most true Friend .
Mrs. Fit .
And such a one I need , but not this way .
Sir , I confess me to you , the meer manner
Of your attempting me this morning , took me ;
And I did hold m ' Invention , and my Manners ,
Were both engag 'd to give it a Requital ;
But not unto your Ends : My Hope was then ,
( Though
( Though interrupted ere it could be utter 'd )
That whom I found the Master of such Language ,
That Brain and Spirit , for such an Enterprise ,
Could not , but if those Succours were demanded
To a right Use , employ them vertuously ,
And make that Profit of his Noble Parts ,
Which they would yield .
Sir , you have now the ground
To exercise them in : I am a Woman ,
That cannot speak more wretchedness of my self ,
Than you can read ; match 'd to a Mass of Folly ,
That every day makes haste to his own Ruin ;
The wealthy Portion that I brought him , spent :
And ( through my Friends neglect ) no Jointure made me .
My Fortunes standing in this Precipice ,
' Tis Counsel that I want , and honest Aids ;
And in this Name I need you for a Friend ,
Never in any other ; for his ill
Must not make me , Sir , worse .
O , Friend , forsake not
The brave Occasion Vertue offers you
To keep you innocent : I have fear 'd for both ,
And watch 'd you , to prevent the ill I fear 'd .
But since the weaker side hath so assur 'd me ,
Let not the stronger fall by his own Vice ,
Or be the less a Friend , 'cause Vertue needs him .
Vertue shall never ask my Succours twice ;
Most Friend , most Man , your Counsels are Commands .
Lady , I can love Goodness in you , more
Than I did Beauty ; and do here intitle
Your Vertue to the Power upon a Life
You shall engage in any fruitful Service ,
Even to forfeit .
Madam : Do you hear , Sir ?
a Project for himself .
We have another Leg strain 'd , for this Dottrel .
H' has a Quarrel to carry , and has caus 'd
A Deed of Feoffment of his whole Estate
To be drawn yonder ; h ' has 't within : And you
Only he means to make Feoffee : H' is faln
So desperately enamour 'd on you , and talks
Most like a Mad-man : you did never hear
A Phrentick so in love with his own Favour !
Now , you do know , 'tis of no validity
In your name , as you stand : Therefore advise him
To put in me .
( H' is come here . )
You shall share , Sir .
MAdam , I have a Suit to you ; and afore-hand ,
I do bespeak you ; you must not deny me ,
I will be granted .
Sir , I must know it , though .
No, Lady , you must not know it : yet you must too ,
For the Trust of it , and the Fame indeed ,
Which else were lost me .
I would use your Name
But in a Feoffment , make my whole Estate
Over unto you : a trifle , a thing of nothing ,
Some Eighteen hundred .
Alas ! I understand not
Those things , Sir : I am a Woman , and most loth
To embark my self ?
You will not slight me , Madam ?
Nor you 'll not quarrel me ?
No, sweet Madam , I have
Already a Dependance ; for which cause
I do this : let me put you in , dear Madam ,
I may be fairly kill 'd .
You have your Friends , Sir ,
About you here for choice .
She tells you right , Sir .
Death , if she do , what do I care for that ?
Say , I would have her tell me wrong .
Why , Sir ,
If for the Trust you 'll let me have the Honour
To name you one .
Nay , you do me the Honour , Madam .
Who is't ?
This Gentleman .
O no , sweet Madam ,
H' is Friend to him with whom I ha' the Dependance .
Who might he be ?
One Wittipol : do you know him ?
Alas , Sir , he ! a Toy : This Gentleman
A Friend to him ?
No more than I am , Sir .
But will your Ladiship undertake that , Madam ?
Yes , and what else , for him , you will engage me .
What is his Name ?
His Name is Eustace Manly .
Whence does he write himself ?
Of Middlesex ,
Say nothing , Madam .
Clerk , come hither ;
Write Eustace Manly , Squire o ' Middlesex .
What ha' you done , Sir ?
Nam 'd a Gentleman ,
That I 'll be answerable for , to you , Sir .
Had I nam 'd you , it might ha' been suspected ;
This way , 'tis safe .
Come , Gentlemen , your Hands
For Witness .
What is this ?
You ha' made Election
Of a most worthy Gentleman ! Man .
Would one of worth
Had spoke it ; whence it comes , it is
Rather a Shame to me , than a Praise .
Sir , I will give you any Satisfaction .
Be silent then : " Falshood commends not Truth .
You do deliver this , Sir , as your Deed ,
To th ' Use of Mr. Manly ?
Yes : and Sir ? ?
When did you see young Wittipol ?
I am ready
For Process now : Sir , this is Publication .
He shall hear from me ; he would needs be courting
My Wife , Sir . Man .
Yes : so witnesseth his Cloke there .
Nay , good Sir ? ?
Madam , you did undertake ?
What ?
That he was not Wittipol 's Friend .
I hear ,
Sir , no confession of it .
O , she knows not ,
Now I remember .
Madam , this young Wittipol
Would ha' debauch 'd my Wife , and made me Cuckold
Thorow a Casement ; he did fly her home
To mine own Window ; but I think I fou't him ,
And ravish 'd her away out of his Pounces .
I ha' sworn to ha' him by the Ears : I fear
The Toy wi' not do me right .
No, that were pity !
What right do you ask , Sir ?
Here he is will do 't you .
Ha ! Wittipol ! VVit .
I , Sir , no more Lady now ,
Nor Spaniard ! Man .
No indeed , 'tis VVittipol .
Am I the thing I fear 'd ?
A Cuckold ?
No, Sir ;
But you were late in possibility ,
I 'll tell you so much .
But your Wife 's too vertuous .
We 'll see her , Sir , at home , and leave you here ,
To be made Duke o ' Shoreditch with a Project .
Thieves , Ravishers .
Cry but another Note , Sir ,
I 'll mar the Tune o ' your Pipe .
Gi' me my Deed then .
Neither : That shall be kept for your Wives good ,
Who will know better how to use it .
Ha !
To feast you with my Land ?
Sir , be you quiet ,
Or I shall gag you ere I go ; consult
Your Master of Dependences , how to make this
A second Business , you have time , Sir . Fit .
Oh !
What will the Ghost of my wise Grandfather ,
My learned Father , with my worshipful Mother ,
Think of me now , that left me in this World
In state to be their Heir ?
that am become
A Cuckold , and an Ass , and my Wives Ward ;
Likely to lose my Land , ha' my Throat cut ;
All , by her Practice ! Mer .
Sir , we are all abus 'd !
And be so still ! Who hinders you , I pray you ?
Let me alone , I would enjoy my self ,
And
And be the Duke o ' Drown 'd-land you ha' made me .
Sir , we must play an After-game o ' this .
But I am not in case to be a Gamester ,
I tell you once again ? ?
You must be rul 'd ,
And take some Counsel .
Sir , I do hate Counsel ,
As I do hate my Wife , my wicked Wife !
But we may think how to recover all ,
If you will act .
I will not think , nor act ,
Nor yet recover ; do not talk to me :
I 'll run out o ' my Wits , rather than hear .
I will be what I am , Fabian Fitz-dottrel ,
Though all the World say nay to't .
Let 's follow him .
Beyond telling !
Here has been that infinity of Strangers !
And then she would ha' had you , to ha' sampled you
With one within , that they are now a teaching ,
And does pretend to your Rank .
Good fellow , Pitfal ,
Tell Mr. Mere-craft , I intreat a word with him .
goes out .
This most unlucky accident will go near
To be the loss o ' my Place , I am in doubt .
With me ?
What say you , Mr. Ambler ?
Sir ,
I would beseech your Worship , stand between
Me and my Ladies displeasure , for my absence .
O , is that all ?
I warrant you .
I would tell you , Sir ,
But how it hapned .
Brief , good Mr. Ambler ,
Put your self to your rack ; for I have Task
Of more importance .
Sir , you 'll laugh at me !
But ( so is Truth ) a very Friend of mine ,
Finding by conference with me , that I liv 'd
Too chaste for my Complexion , ( and indeed
Too honest for my Place , Sir ) did advise me ,
If I did love my self , ( as that I do ,
I must confess . )
Spare your Parenthesis .
To gi' my Body a little Evacuation ? ?
Well , and you went to a Whore ?
No, Sir , I durst not
( For fear it might arrive at some bodies Ear
It should not ) trust my self to a Common House ;
But got the Gentlewoman to go with me ,
And carry her Bedding to a Conduit-head ,
Hard by the Place toward Tyburn , which they call
My L.
Mayor 's Banquetting-house .
Now , Sir , this morning
Was Execution ; and I ne 'er dreamt on't ,
Till I heard the noise o ' the People , and the Horses ;
And neither I , nor the poor Gentlewoman
Durst stir , till all was done and past : so that
I ' the interim we fell asleep again .
Nay , if you fall from your Gallop , I am gone , Sir .
But when I wak 'd , to put on my Clothes , a Sute
And a fine new Device I had to carry
My Pen and Ink , my Civet , and my Tooth-picks ,
All under one .
But that which griev 'd me , was
The Gentlewomans Shooes ( with a pair of Roses ,
And Garters ) I had given her for the Business ;
So as that made us stay till it was dark :
For I was fain to lend her mine , and walk
In a Rug , by her , barefoot , to St .
A kind of Irish Penance ! Is this all , Sir ?
To satisfie my Lady .
I will promise you , Sir .
I ha' told the true Disaster .
I cannot stay wi' you ,
Sir , to condole ; but gratulate your Return .
An honest Gentleman ; but he 's never at leasure
To be himself , he has such Tides of Business .
To yoking Foxes , milking of He-goats ,
Pounding of Water in a Mortar , laving
The Sea dry with a Nut-shell , gathering all
The Leaves are faln this Autumn , drawing Farts
Out of dead Bodies , making Ropes of Sand ,
Catching the Winds together in a Net ,
Mustring of Ants , and numbring Atoms ; all
That Hell and you thought exquisite Torments , rather
Than stay me here a thought more : I would sooner
Keep Fleas within a Circle , and be Accomptant
A thousand Year , which of 'em , and how far ,
Out-leap 'd the other , than endure a Minute
Such as I have within .
There is no Hell
To a Lady of fashion .
All your Tortures there
Are Pastimes to it .
' Twould be a refreshing
For me , to be i' the Fire again , from hence .
This is my Sute , and those the Shooes and Roses !
Th' have such impertinent Vexations ,
A general Council o ' Devils could not hit ? ?
Ha ! This is he I took asleep with his Wench ,
And borrow 'd his Clothes .
What might I do to balk him ?
Do you hear , Sir ?
Answer him , but not to th ' purpose .
What is your Name , I pray you , Sir ?
Is't so late , Sir ?
I ask not o ' the time , but of your Name , Sir .
I thank you , Sir . Yes , it does hold , Sir , certain .
Hold , Sir ?
What holds ?
I must both hold , and talk to you
About these Clothes .
A very pretty Lace !
But the Taylor cozen 'd me .
No, I am cozen 'd
By you ! robb 'd .
Why , when you please , Sir ; I am
For three-peny Gleek , your Man .
Pox o ' your Gleek ,
And three-pence : Give me an answer .
Sir ,
My Master is the best at it .
Your Master !
Who is your Master ?
Let it be Friday-night .
VVhat should be then ?
Your best Song 's Thom .
o ' Bet 'lem .
I think , you are he .
Does he mock me trow , from purpose ?
Or do not I speak to him what I mean ?
Good Sir , your Name .
Only a couple o ' Cocks , Sir ;
If we can get a Widgeon , 'tis in season .
He hopes to make one o ' these Scipticks o ' me ,
( I think I name 'em right ) and does not fly me :
I wonder at that ! 'tis a strange Confidence !
I 'll prove another way , to draw his answer .
As plain as fizzling : Roll but wi' your Eyes ,
And foam at th ' Mouth .
A little Castle-soap
Will do 't , to rub your Lips ; and then a Nut-shell ,
With Tow , and Touch-wood in it , to spit Fire .
Did you ne 'er read , Sir , little Darrel 's Tricks
With the Boy o ' Burton , and the Seven in Lancashire ,
Sommers at Nottingham ?
All these do teach it .
And we 'll give out , Sir , that your Wife has bewitch 'd you .
And practis 'd with those two , as Sorcerers .
And ga' you Potions , by which means you were
Not
Not Compos mentis , when you made your Feoffment .
There 's no recovery o ' your State but this :
This , Sir , will sting .
And move in a Court of Equity .
For it is more than manifest , that this was
A plot o ' your Wives , to get your Land .
I think it .
Sir , it appears .
Nay , and my Cousin has known
These Gallants in these shapes .
T' have done strange things , Sir .
One as the Lady , the other as the Squire .
How a Mans honesty may be fool 'd ! I thought him
A very Lady .
So did I : renounce me else .
But this way , Sir , you 'll be reveng 'd at height .
Upon 'em all .
Yes faith , and since your Wife
Has run the way of Woman thus , e 'en give her ?
Lost , by this Hand , to me ; dead to all joys
Of her dear Dottrel , I shall never pity her ,
That could pity her self .
Princely resolv 'd , Sir ,
And like your self still , in Potenti? .
What news ?
O Sir , my hundred Pieces :
Let me ha' them yet ?
Yes , Sir . Officers ,
Arrest him .
Me ?
I arrest you .
Keep the Peace ,
I charge you , Gentlemen .
Arrest me ?
Why ?
For better security , Sir . My Son Plutarchus
Assures me y ' are not worth a Groat .
Pardon me , Father ,
I said his Worship had no foot of Land left :
And that I 'll justifie , for I writ the Deed .
Ha' you these tricks i' the City ?
Yes , and more .
Arrest this Gallant too , here , at my sute .
I , and at mine .
He owes me for his lodging
Two year and a quarter .
Why Mr. Guilt-head , Land-Lord ,
Thou art not mad , though th'art Constable
Puft up with th ' pride of the place ?
Do you hear , Sirs .
Have I deserv 'd this from you two ?
for all
My pains at Court , to get you each a Patent .
For what ?
Upo ' my project o ' the Forks .
Forks ?
what be they ?
The laudable use of Forks ,
Brought into custom here , as they are in Italy ,
To th ' sparing o ' Napkins .
That , that should have made
Your Bellows go at the Forge , as his at the Fornace .
I ha' procur 'd it , ha' the Signet for it ,
Dealt with the Linen-drapers , on my private
Bie , 'cause I fear 'd they were the likeliest ever
To stir against , to cross it : for 'twill be
A mighty saver of Linen through the Kingdom
( As that is one o ' my grounds , and to spare washing . )
Now , on you two , had I laid all the profits .
Guilt-head to have the making of all those
Of Gold and Silver , for the better personages ;
And you , of those of Steel for the common sort .
And both by Patent .
I had brought you your Seals in ,
But now you have prevented me , and I thank you .
Sir , I will bail you , at mine own ap-peril .
Nay chuse .
Do you so too , good Father .
I like the fashion o ' the project well ,
The Forks ! It may be a lucky one ! and is not
Intricate , as one would say , but fit for
Plain Heads , as ours , to deal in .
Do you hear ,
Officers , we discharge you .
Why this shews
A little good nature in you , I confess ,
But do not tempt your Friends thus .
Little Guilt-head ,
Advise your Sire , great Guilt-head , from these courses :
And , here , to trouble a great Man in reversion ,
For a matter o ' fifty on a false Alarm ,
Away , it shews not well .
Let him get the Pieces
And bring 'em .
You 'll hear more else .
I ha' been to seek you .
You are the Constable , they say .
Here 's one
That I do charge with Felony , for the sute
He wears , Sir . Mer .
Who ?
Mr. Fitz-dottrel 's Man ?
' Ware what you do , Mr. Ambler .
Sir , these Clothes ,
I 'll swear , are mine : and the Shooes the Gentlewomans
I told you of : and ha' him afore a Justice ,
I will .
My Master , Sir , will pass his word for me .
O , can you speak to purpose now ?
Not I ,
If you be such a one , Sir , I will leave you
To your God-fathers in Law .
Let twelve Men work .
Do you hear , Sir , pray , in private .
Well , what say you ?
Brief , for I have no time to lose .
Truth is , Sir ,
I am the very Devil , and had leave
To take this body I am in , to serve you :
Which was a Cut-purses , and hang 'd this Morning .
And it is likewise true , I stole this sute
To cloath me with .
But , Sir , let me not go
To Prison for it .
I have hitherto
Lost time , done nothing ; shown , indeed , no part
O' my Devils nature .
Now , I will so help
Your malice , 'gainst these Parties : so advance
The business , that you have in hand of Witchcraft ,
And your possession , as my self were in you .
Teach you such tricks , to make your Belly swell ,
And your Eyes turn , to foam , to stare , to gnash
Your Teeth together , and to beat your self ,
Laugh round , and feign six voices ?
Out you Rogue !
You most infernal counterfeit wretch ! Avant !
Do you think to gull me with your ?sop 's Fables ?
Here , take him to you , I ha' no part in him .
Away , I do disclaim , I will not hear you .
What said he to you , Sir ?
Like a lying Rascal
Told me he was the Devil .
How ! a good Jest !
And that he would teach me such fine Devils tricks
For our new resolution .
O' Pox on him ,
' Twas excellent wisely done , Sir , not to trust him .
Why , if he were the Devil , we sha' not need him ,
If you 'll be rul 'd .
Go throw your self on a Bed , Sir ,
And feign you ill .
We 'll not be seen wi' you ,
Till after , that you have a fit : and all
Confirm 'd within .
Keep you with the two Ladies
And perswade them .
I 'll to Justice Eitherside ,
And possess him with all .
Trains shall seek out Ingine ,
And they two fill the Town with't ; every Cable
Is to be veer 'd .
We must employ out all
Our Emissaries now .
Sir , I will send you
Bladders and Bellows .
Sir , be confident ,
' Tis no hard thing t 'out-do the Devil in :
A Boy o ' thirteen year old made him an Ass
But t'tother day .
Well , I 'll begin to practise ,
And scape the imputation of being Cuckold ,
By mine own act .
Yo ' are right .
Q q q Ever .
Come ,
Come , you ha' put
Your self to a simple coil here , and your Friends ,
By dealing with new Agents , in new Plots .
No more o ' that , sweet Cousin .
What had you
To do with this same Wittipol , for a Lady ?
Question not that ; 'tis done .
You had some strain
' Bove E-la ?
I had indeed .
And now you crack for't .
Do not upbraid me .
Come , you must be told on't ;
You are so covetous , still , to embrace
More than you can , that you lose all .
' Tis right .
What would you more than Guilty ?
Now , your succours .
HEre you are lodg 'd , Sir , you must send your garnish ,
If you 'll be private .
There it is , Sir , leave me .
To Newgate , brought ?
How is the name of Devil
Discredited in me ! What a lost Fiend
Shall I be , on return ?
My Chief will roar
In triumph , now , that I have been on Earth
A day , and done no noted thing , but brought
That body back here , was hang 'd out this morning .
Well ! would it once were midnight , that I knew
My utmost .
I think Time be drunk , and sleeps ;
He is so still , and moves not ! I do glory
Now i' my torment .
Neither can I expect it ,
I have it with my fact .
Child of Hell , be thou merry :
Put a look on , as round , Boy , and red as a Cherry .
Cast care at thy Posterns , and firk i' thy Fetters :
They are Ornaments , Baby , have graced thy betters :
Look upon me , and hearken .
Our Chief doth salute thee ,
And lest our cold Iron should chance to confute thee ,
H' hath sent thee , Grant-parol by me to stay longer
A Month here on Earth , against cold , Child , or honger .
How ?
longer here a Month ?
Yes , Boy , till the Session ,
That so thou maist have a triumphal egression .
In a Cart , to be hang 'd .
No, Child , in a Car ,
The Chariot of Triumph , which most of them are .
And in the mean time , to be greazy , and bouzy ,
And nasty , and filthy , and ragged and louzy ,
With dam'n me , renounce me ; and all the fine Phrases ,
That bring unto Tyburn , the plentiful gazes .
He is a Devil ! and may be our Chief !
The great Superior Devil ! for his malice :
Arch-devil ! I acknowledge him .
He knew
What I would suffer , when he ti 'd me up thus
In a Rogues body : and he has ( I thank him )
His tyrannous pleasure on me , to confine me
To the unlucky Carkass of a Cut-purse ,
Wherein I could do nothing .
with all his days work .
Impudent Fiend ,
Stop thy lewd Mouth .
Dost thou not shame and tremble
To lay thine own dull damn 'd defects upon
An innocent case , there ?
Why , thou heavy slave !
The Spirit that did possess that Flesh before
Put more true life in a Finger and a Thumb ,
Than thou in the whole Mass .
Yet thou rebell 'st
And murmur 'st ?
What one proffer hast thou made ,
Wicked enough , this day , that might be call 'd
Worthy thine own , much less the name that sent thee ?
First , thou did 'st help thy self into a beating
Promptly , and with't endangered 'st too thy Tongue :
A Devil , and could not keep a body intire
One day ! That , for our credit : And to vindicate it ,
Hinder 'dst ( for ought thou know 'st ) a deed of darkness :
Which was an act of that egregious folly ,
As no one , to 'ard the Devil , could ha' thought on .
This for your acting ! but for suffering ! why
Thou hast been cheated on , with a false Beard ,
And a turn 'd Cloke .
Faith , would your predecessor
The Cut-purse , think you ha' been so ?
Out upon thee ,
The hurt th ' hast done , to let Men know their strength ,
And that the 'are are able to out-do a Devil
Put in a body , will for ever be
A scar upon our Name ! whom hast thou dealt with ,
Woman or Man , this day , but have out-gone thee
Some way , and most have prov 'd the better Fiends ?
Yet , you would be imploy 'd ?
Yes , Hell shall make you
Provincial o ' the Cheaters ! or Bawd-ledger ,
For this side o ' the Town ! No doubt you 'll render
A rare account of things .
Bane o ' your Itch ,
And scratching for Imployment .
I 'll ha' Brimstone
To allay it sure , and Fire to singe your Nails off ,
But that I would not such a damn 'd dishonor
Stick on our state , as that the Devil were hang 'd ;
And could not save a body , that he took
From Tyburn , but it must come thither again :
You should e 'en ride .
But up , away with him ?
Mount darling of darkness , my Shoulders are broad :
He that carries the Fiend , is sure of his load .
The Devil was wont to carry away the Evil ;
But now the Evil out-carries the Devil .
come out affrighted .
OMe ! Keep.
What 's this ?
A piece of Justice
Hall
Is broken down .
Fough ! what a steam of Brimstone
Is here ?
The Prisoner 's dead , came in but now !
Ha ?
where ?
Look here .
' Slid , I should know his countenance !
It is Gill-cut-purse , was hang 'd out this morning !
' Tis he ! 2.
The Devil sure has a hand in this !
What shall we do ?
Carry the news of it
Unto the Sheriffs .
And to the Justices .
This strange !
And favours of the Devil , strongly !
I ' ha' the Sulphur of Hell-coal i' my Nose .
Carry him in .
How rank it is !
To them . ]
Wittipol , Manly , Mistris Fitz-dottrel , Ingine .
To them . ]
Guilt-head , Sledge , Shackles .
The Justice comes out wondring , at the rest informing him .
THis was the notablest Conspiracy ,
That ere I heard of .
Sir , They had giv'n him Potions ,
That did enamour him on the counterfeit Lady ? ?
Just to the time o ' delivery o ' thee Deed ?
And then the witchcraft 'gan' t ' appear , for
straight
He fell into his fit .
Of rage at first , Sir ,
Which since has so increased .
Good
Good Sir Poul , see him ,
And punish the Impostors .
Therefore I come , Madam .
Let Mr. Eitherside alone , Madam .
Do you hear ?
Call in the Constable , I will have him by :
H'is the King 's Officer ! and some Citizens ,
Of credit ! I 'll discharge my Conscience clearly .
Yes , Sir , and send for his Wife .
And the two Sorcerers ,
By any means ! Tay .
I thought one a true Lady ,
I should be sworn .
So did you , Eitherside ?
Yes , by that light , would I might ne 'er stir else ,
And the other a civil Gentleman .
But , Madam ,
You know what I told your Ladiship ?
I now see it :
I was providing of a Banquet for 'em .
After I had done instructing o ' the Fellow
De-vile , the Gentlemans Man .
Who 's found a Thief , Madam .
And to have rob 'd your Usher , Master Ambler .
This morning .
How ?
I 'll tell you more , anon .
Gi' me some Garlick , Garlick , Garlick , Garlick .
Hark , the poor Gentleman , how he is tormented !
My Wife is a Whore , I 'll kiss her no more : and why ?
Ma'st not thou be a Cuckold , as well as I ?
Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , &c .
That is the Devil speaks , and laughs in him .
Do you think so , Sir ?
I discharge my Conscience .
And is not the Devil good company ?
Yes , wis .
How he changes , Sir , his Voice !
And a Cuckold is
Where ere he put his Head , with a Wanion ,
If his Horns be forth , the Devil 's companion !
Look , look , look , else .
How he foams ! Ever .
And swels !
O , me ! what 's that there rises in his Belly !
A strange thing ! hold it down .
We cannot , Madam .
' Tis too apparent this ! Fit .
Wittipol , Wittipol .
dottrel enter .
How now , what play ha' we here :
What fine , new matters ?
The Cockscomh , and the Coverlet .
O strange impudence !
That these should come to face their sin !
And out-face
Justice , they are the Parties , Sir . Pov.
Say nothing .
Did you mark , Sir , upon their coming in ,
How he call 'd Wittipol ?
And never saw 'em .
I warrant you did I , let 'em play a while .
Buz , buz , buz , buz .
' Lass poor Gentleman ,
How he is tortur 'd ! Mrs. Fit .
Fie Master Fitz-dottrel !
What do you mean to counterfeit thus ?
O , O ,
She comes with a Needle , and thrusts it in ,
She pulls out that , and she puts in a Pin ,
And now , and now , I do not know how , nor where ,
But she pricks me here , and she pricks me there : Oh , oh :
Woman forbear .
What , Sir ?
A practice foul
For one so fair .
Hath this , then , credit with you ?
Do you believe in't ?
Gentlemen , I 'll discharge
My Conscience .
' Tis a clear conspiracy !
A dark and devillish practice ! I detest it !
The Justice sure will prove the merrier Man !
This is most strange , Sir !
Come not to confront
Authority with impudence : I tell you
I do detest it .
Here comes the Kings Constable ,
And with him a right worshipful Commoner ;
My good Friend , Master Guilt-head ! I am glad
I can before such witnesses , profess
My Conscience , and my Detestation of it .
Horrible ! most unnatural ! abominable !
You do not tumble enough .
Wallow , gnash :
O , how he is vexed ! Pou .
' Tis too manifest .
Give him more Soap to foam with , now lie still .
And act a little .
What do 's he now , Sir .
Shew
The taking of Tabacco , with which the Devil
Is so delighted .
Hum ! Pou .
And calls for Hum .
You takers of strong Waters , and Tabacco ,
Mark this .
Yellow , yellow , yellow , yellow , &c .
That 's Starch ! the Devil 's Idol of that colour .
He ratifies it , with clapping of his Hands .
The proofs are pregnant .
How the Devil can act !
He is the Master of Players ! Master Guilt-head ,
And Poets too ! you heard him talk in Rhime !
I had forgot to observe it to you , ere while !
See , he spits Fire .
O no he plays at Figgum ,
The Devil is the Author of wicked Figgum ? ?
Juglers Game .
Why speak you not unto him ?
If I had
All innocence of Man to be indanger 'd ,
And he could save , or ruin it : I'ld not breath
A syllable in request , to such a Fool ,
He makes himself .
O they whisper , whisper , whisper .
We shall have more of Devils a score ,
To come to dinner , in me the sinner .
Alas , poor Gentleman !
Put 'em asunder .
Keep 'em one from the other .
Are you phrentick , Sir ?
Or what grave dotage moves you to take part
With so much villany ?
we are not afraid
Either of Law , or Trial ; let us be
Examin 'd what our ends were , what the means ?
To work by ; and possibility of those means .
Do not conclude against us , ere you hear us .
I will not hear you , yet I will conclude
Out of the circumstances .
Will you so , Sir ?
Yes , they are palpable .
Not as your folly :
I will discharge my Conscience , and do all
To the Meridian of Justice .
You do well , Sir .
Provide me to eat , three or four dishes o ' good Meat ,
I 'll feast them , and their trains , a Justice Head and Brains
Shall be the first .
The Devil loves not Justice ,
There you may see .
A Spare-rib o ' my Wife ,
And a Whores Purt 'nance ! a Guilt-head whole .
Be not you troubled , Sir , the Devil speaks it .
Yes , wis , Knight , shite , Poul , Joul , Owle , foul , troul ,
Cramb , another of the Devils Games !
Speak , Sir , some Greek , if you can .
Is not the
Justice
A solemn Gamester ?
Oi moi , cacodaimwn ,
Kai triscacodaimwn , cai tetraciV , cai pentaciV ,
Kai dwdecaciV , cai mnriaciV .
He curses
In Greek , I think .
Your Spanish , that I taught you .
Quebr?mos el ojo de burlas .
How ?
your rest ?
Let 's break his Neck in jest , the Devil says ,
Di gr?tia , Sign?r mio se ha?ete den?ri fatam?ne parte .
What , would the Devil borrow Money ?
Q q q 2 Ouy
Ouy , Ouy Monsieur , ?n p?uvre Diable ! Diablet in !
It is the Devil , by his several Languages .
Where 's Sir Poul Eitherside ?
Here , what 's the matter ?
O ! such an accident fal 'n out at Newgate , Sir :
A great piece of the Prison is rent down !
The Devil has been there , Sir , in the body ? ?
Of the young Cut-purse , was hang 'd out this morning ,
But , in new Clothes , Sir , every one of us know him .
These things were found in his Pocket .
Those are mine , Sir .
I think he was committed on your charge , Sir .
For a new Felony .
He 's gone , Sir , now ,
And left us the dead body .
But withal , Sir ,
Such an infernal stink , and steam behind ,
You cannot see St .
Pulchres Steeple , yet .
They smel 't as far as Ware , as the wind lies ,
By this time , sure .
Is this upon your credit , Friend ?
Sir , you may see , and satisfie your self .
Nay , then , 'tis time to leave off counterfeiting .
Sir I am not betwitch 'd , nor have a Devil :
No more than you .
I do defie him , I ,
And did abuse you .
These two Gentlemen
Put me upon it .
( I have faith against him )
They taught me all my tricks .
I will tell truth ,
And shame the Fiend .
See , here , Sir , are my Bellows ,
And my false Belly , and my Mouse , and all
That should ha' come forth ?
Sir , are not you asham 'd
Now of your solemn , serious vanity ?
I will make honourable amends to truth .
And so will I.
But these are Cozeners still ,
And ha' my Land , as Plotters , with my Wife :
Who , though she be not a Witch , is worse , a Whore .
Sir , you belie her .
She is chaste , and vertuous ,
And we are honest .
I do know no glory
A Man should hope , by venting his own Follies ,
But you 'll still be an Ass in spight of Providence .
Please you go in , Sir , and hear truths , then judge 'em ,
And make amends for your late rashness , when
You shall but hear the pains and care was taken ,
To save this fool from ruine , ( his Grace of Drown 'd-land . )
My Land is drown 'd indeed ? ?
And how much
His modest and too worthy Wife hath suffer 'd
By mis-construction from him , you will blush ,
First , for your own belief , more for his actions !
His Land is his : and never , by my Friend ,
Or by my self , meant to another use ,
But for her succours , who hath equal right .
If any other had worse Counsels in't ,
( I know I speak to those can apprehend me )
Let 'em repent 'em , and be not detected .
It is not manly to take joy , or pride
In human errors ( we do all ill things ,
They do 'em worst that love 'em , and dwell there ,
Till the Plague comes . )
The few that have the Seeds
Of goodness left , will sooner make their way
To a true life , by shame than punishment .
