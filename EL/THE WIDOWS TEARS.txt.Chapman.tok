Thou blind imperfect goddess , that delight 'st , Like a deep-reaching statesman , to con- verse Only with fools ; jealous of knowing spirits , For fear their piercing judgments might discover Thy inward weakness , and despise thypower ;
Contemn thee for a goddess ; thou that ladest Th'unworthy ass with gold , while worth and merit Serve thee for nought , weak Fortune , I renounce Thy vain dependance , and convert my duty And sacrifices of my sweetest thoughts , To a more noble deity . Sole friend to worth , And patroness of all good spirits , Confi- dence , She be my guide , and hers the praise of these My worthy undertakings .
E,itcr Lysander with a glass in his hand,Cynthia , Hylus , Ero .
Morrow , brother ; not ready yet ?
No ; I have somewhat of the brother in me . I dare say your wife is many times ready , and you not up . Save you , sister ; how are you enamoured of mypresence ? how like you my aspect ?
Faith , no worse than I did last week ; the weather has nothing changedthe grain of your complexion .
A firm proof 'tis in grain , and are not all complexions :A good soldier 's face , sister .
Made to be worn under a beaver .
Ay , and 'twould show well enoughunder a mask , too .
So much for the face .
But is there no object in this suit towhet your tongue upon ?
None , but Fortune send you well towear it ; for she best knows how you got it .
' Faith , 'tis the portion she bestows upon younger brothers ; valour , and good clothes . Marry , if you ask how we come by this new suit , I must take time to answer it ; for as the ballad says , // / written books I find it . Brother , these are the blossoms of spirit ; and I will have it said for my father 's honour , that some of hischildren were truly begotten .
Not all ?
Shall I tell you , brother , that I know will rejoice you ? My former suits havebeen all spenders , this shall be a speeder .
A thing to be heartily wished ; but , brother , take heed you be not gulled ; benot too forward .
T had been well for me if you had followed that counsel . You were too for- ward when you stepped into the world before me and gulled me of the land , that myspirits and parts were indeed born to .
May we not have the blessing to know the aim of your fortunes ? what coast ,for heaven 's love ?
Nay , 'tis a project of state : you may see the preparation , but the design lieshidden in the breasts of the wise .
May we not know't ?
Not unless you 'll promise me to laugh at it , for without your applause I'llnone .
The quality of it may be such as a laugh will not be ill bestowed upon't ; prayheaven I call not Arsace sister .
What , the pandress ?
Know you ( as who knows not ) the exquisite lady of the palace , the late governor 's admired widow , the rich and haughty Countess Eudora ? Were not she a jewel worth the wearing , if a man knewhow to win her ?
How 's that ? how 's that ?
Brother , there is a certain goddess called Confidence , that carries a main stroke in honourable preferments . Fortune waits upon her , Cupid is at her beck ; she sends them both of errands . This deity doth promise me much assistance in thisbusiness .
But if this deity should draw you up in a basket to your countess 's window , and there let you hang for all the wits inthe town to shoot at ; how then ?
If she do , let them shoot their bolts and spare not ; I have a little bird in a cage here that sings me better comfort . What should be the bar ? You 'll say , I was pageto the Count her husband . What of that ?
THE WIDOWS TEARS .
3C9 sleep I know cannot close till she have embraced the substance .
All this savours of the blind goddessyou speak of .
Why should I despair , but that Cupid hath one dart in store for her great ladyship , as well as for any other huge lady whom she hath made stoop gallant to kiss their worthy followers ? In a word , 1 am assured of my speed . Such fair at- tempts led by a brave resolve are evermoreseconded by Fortune .
But , brother , have I not heard you say your own ears have been witness to her vows , made solemnly to your late lord , in memory of him to preserve till death the unstained honour of a widow 's bed ? If nothing else , yet that might cool your confidence .
Tush , sister , suppose you should protest with solemn oath ( as perhaps you have done , if ever heaven hears your prayers , that you may live to see my brother nobly interred ) , to feed only upon fish and not endure the touch of flesh , during thewretched Lent of your miserable life ;
would you believe it , brother ?
I am therein most confident .
Indeed you had better believe it than try it . But pray , sister , tell me you are a woman do not you wives nod your heads and smile one upon another when yemeet abroad ?
Smile ? why so ?
As who should say , Are not we mad wenches , that can lead our blind hus ' bands thus by the noses ? Do you not brag j among yourselves how grossly you abuse j their honest credulities ? how they adore I you for saints ; and you believe it ? while ' you adorn their temples , and . they believe it not ? how you vow widowhood in their lifetime , and they believe you , when even in the sight of their breathless corse , ere they be fully cold , you join embraces with his groom , or his physician , and perhaps his poisoner ; or at least , by the next moon ( if you can expect so long ) solemnly plight new hymeneal bonds , with a wild , confident , untamed ruffian .
As for example .
And make him the top of his house , and sovereign lord of the palace , as for example . Look you , brother , thisglass is mine .
What of that ?
While I am with it , it takes impression from my face ; but can I make it so mine , that it shall be of no use to any other ? Will it not do his office to you or you ; and as well to my groom as to myself ? Brother , monopolies are cried down .
Is it not madness for me to believe , when I have conquered that fort of chastity the great Countess ; that if another man of my making and mettle shall assault her , her eyes and ears shall lose their function , her other parts their use , as if nature had made her all in vain , unless I only had stumbledinto her quarters ?
Brother , I fear me in your travels , you have drunk too much of that Italian air , that hath infected the whole mass of your ingenuous nature , dried up in you all sap of generous disposition , poisoned the very essence of your soul , and so polluted your senses , that whatsoever enters there takes from them contagion , and is to your fancy represented as foul and tainted ,which in itself perhaps is spotless .
No, sister , it hath refined my senses , and made me see with clear eyes , and to judge of objects , as they truly are , not as they seem , and through their mask to discern the true face of things . It tells me how short-lived widows ' tears are , that their weeping is in truth but laughing under a mask , that they mourn in their gowns and laugh in their sleeves ; all which I believe as a Delphian oracle , and am resolved to burn in that faith ; and in that resolution do I march to the greatlady .
You lose time , brother , in discourse ;
by this had you bore up with the lady , and clapped her aboard , for I know your confidence will not dwell long in the service .
No, I will perform it in the conqueror 's style . Your way is , not towin Penelope by suit , but by surprise .
The castle 's carried by a sudden assault , that would perhaps sit out a twelvemonth 's siege . It would be a good breeding to my young nephew here , if he could procure a stand at the palace to see with what alacrity I 'll accost her countesship , in what garb I will woo her , with what facility Iwill win her .
It shall go hard but we 'll hear yourentertainment for your confidence sake .
And having won her , nephew , this sweet face Which all the city says is so like me , Like me shall be preferr 'd , for I will wed thee To my great widow 's daughter and sole heir, The lovely spark , the bright Laodice .
310
In this eye I see That fire that shall in me inflame the mother , And that in this shall set on fire the daughter .
It goes , sir , in a blood ; believe me , brother , These destinies go ever in a blood .
These diseases do , brother , take heed of them ; fare you well ; take heedyou be not baffled .

Now , thou that art the third blind deity That governs earth in all her happiness , The life of all endowments , Confidence ,Direct and prosper my intention .
Lysander , Lycus .
' Tis miraculous that you tell me , sir ; he come to woo our lady mistress forhis wife ?
' Tis a frenzy he is possessed with , and will not be cured but by some violent remedy . And you shall favour me so much to make me a spectator of the scene . But is she , say you , already accessible for suitors ? I thought she would have stood so stiffly on her widow vow , that she would notendure the sight of a suitor .
Faith , sir , Penelope could not bar her gates against her wooers , but she will still be mistress of herself . It is , you know , a certain itch in female blood : they love to be sued to ; but she 'll hearken tono suitors .
But by your leave , Lycus , Penelope is not so wise as her husband Ulysses , for he , fearing the jaws of the Syren , stopped his ears with wax against her voice . They that fear the adder 's sting , will not come near her hissing . Is any suitor with hernow ?
A Spartan lord , dating himself our great viceroy 's kinsman , and two or three other of his country lords , as spots in his train . He comes armed with his Altitude 's letters in grace of his person , with promise | to make her a duchess if .-^e embrace the i match . This is no mean attraction to herhigh thoughts ; but yet she disdains him .
And how then shall my brother presume of acceptance ? yet I hold it much more under her contentment , to marry such a nasty braggart , than under her honour to wed my brother a gentleman , ( though I say 't ) more honourably descended than that lord ; who , perhaps , for all his ancestry , would be much troubled to nameyou the place where his father was born .
Nay , I hold no comparison betwixt your brother and him . And the venerean disease , to which they say he has been long wedded , shall I hope first rot him , ere sheendure the savour of his sulphurous breath .
Well , her ladyship is at hand ; y 'are besttake you to your stand .
And one whose veins swell so with hisblood , madam , as they do in his lordship .
A near and dear kinsman his lord - ship is to his Altitude the Viceroy ; in care of whose good speed here , I know his Al- titude hath not slept a sound sleep sincehis departure .
I thank Venus I have , ever since hecame .
You sleep away your honour , madam ,if you neglect me .
Neglect your lordship ? that were anegligence np less than disloyalty .
I much doubt that , sir ; it were rather a presumption to take him , being ofthe blood viceroyal .
Not at all , being offered , madam .
But offered ware is not so sweet , you know . They are the graces of the Viceroy that woo me , not your lordship 's , and I conceive it should be neither honour nor pleasure to you to be taken in foranother man 's favours .
Taken in , madam ? you speak as Ihad no house to hide my head in .
I have heard so indeed , my lord ,unless it be another man 's .
You have heard untruth then : these lords can well witness I can want nohouses .
Nor palaces neither , my lord .
Nor courts neither .
Nor temples , I think , neither ; Ibelieve we shall have a god of him .
See the bold fellow ! whither willyou , sir ?
Away ! all honour to you , madam !
How now , base companion ?
Base , madam ? he 's not base thatfights as high as your lips .
And does that beseem my servant ?
Your court servant , madam .
One that waited on my board ?
That was only a preparation tomy weight on your bed , madam .
How darest thou come to me withsuch a thought ?
Come to you , madam ? I dare come to you at midnight , and bid defiance to the proudest spirit that haunts these your loved shadows ; and would any way make terrible the access of my love toyou .
Love me ? love my dog .
I am bound to that by the proverb , madam .
Kennel without with him , intrudenot here . What is it thou presumest on ?
On your judgment , madam , to choose a man , and not a giant ; as these are that come with titles and authority , as they would conquer or ravish you . But I come to you with the liberal and ingenuous graces , love , youth , and gentry ;
which , in no more deformed a person thanmyself , deserve any princess .
In your saucy opinion , sir , and sirrah too ; get gone ; and let this malapert humour return thee no more , for aforeheaven I 'll have thee tossed in blankets .
In blankets , madam ? you must add your sheets , and you must be thetosser .
Nay then , sir , y 'are as gross as youare saucy .
And all one , sir, - for I am neither .
Thou art both .
Thou liest ; keep up your smiter , Lord Rebus .
Usest thou thus his Altitude 's cousin ?
The place thou knowest protectsthee .
Tie up your valour then till an- other place turn me loose to you . You are the lord , I take it , that wooed my greatmistress here with letters from his Altitude ;
which while she was reading , your lordship ' . ( to entertain time ) stroddled and scaled your fingers ; as you would show what an itching desire you had to get betwixt hersheets .
' Slight ! why does your lordshipendure him ?
The place , the place , my lord .
Be you his attorney , sir ?
What would you do , sir ?
Make thee leap out at window at which thou earnest in : whoreson bagpipe lords .
What rudeness is this ?
What tameness is it in you , madam , to stick at the discarding of such a suitor ? A lean lord , dubbed with the lard of others ! A diseased lord too , that opening certain magic characters in an un- lawful book , up start as many aches in 's bones , as there are ouches in 's skin . Send him , mistress , to the widow your tenant , the virtuous pandress Arsace . I perceive he has crowns in 's purse , that make him proud of a string ; let her pluck the goosetherefore , and her maids dress him .
Ps , Still , my lord , suffer him ?
The place , sir , believe it , the place .
O , good Lord Rebus , the place is never like to be yours that you need respectit so much .
Thou wrong 'st the noble gentleman .
Noble gentleman ? A tumour , an impostume , he is , madam ; a very haut- boy , a bag-pipe , in whom there is nothing but wind , and that none of the sweetestneither .
Quit the house of him by the headand shoulders .
Thanks to your honour , madam , and my lord cousin , the Viceroy shall thankyou .
So shall he indeed , sir .
^ ' \ Will you begone , sir ?
Away , poor fellows .
What is he made of , or what devil sees your childish and effeminate spirits in him , that thus ye shun him ?
Free us of thy sight .
Begone , or I protest thy life shall go !
Yet shall my ghost stay still , and haunt those beauties And glories that have render 'd it immortal .
But since I see your blood runs , for the time , High in that contradiction that fore-runs Truest agreements ( like the elements , Fighting before they generate ) , and that time 3 I2
Do not come again .
If he shall dare to come again , Icharge you shut doors upon him .
You must shut them , madam , To all men else then , if it please your honour ;
For if that any enter , he 'll be one .
I hope , wise sir , a guard will keephim out .
Afore heaven , not a guard , an'tplease your honour .
Thou liest , base ass ; one man enforce a guard ?
I 'll turn ye all away , by our isle 's goddess , If he but set a foot within my gates .
Your honour shall do well to havehim poisoned .
Lysander , from his stand .
This braving wooer hath the success expected ; the favour I obtained made me witness to the sport , and let his confidence be sure , I 'll give it him home . The news by this is blown through the four quarters of the city . Alas ! good confidence ; but the happiness is , he has a forehead of proof ; the stain shall never stick there ,whatsoever his reproach be .
What ? In discourse ?
Hell and the furies take this vile encounter ;
Who would imagine this Saturnian pea - cock Could be so barbarous to use a spiritOf my erection , with such low respect ?
' Fore heaven , it cuts my gall ; but I 'll dissemble it .
What ? My noble lord ?
Well , sir , that may be yet , and means to be .
What means your lordship then , tohang that head that hath been so erected ;
it knocks , sir , at your bosom to come inand hide itself .
Not a jot .
I hope by this time it needs fearno horns .
Well , sir , but yet that blessingruns not always in a blood .
What , blanketed ? O the gods !
Spurned out by grooms , like a base bisogno ! Thrust out by th'heacl andshoulders !
You do well , sir , to take your pleasure of me ; I may turn tables withyou ere long .
What , has thy wit 's fine engine taken cold ? art stuffed in th " head ? canstanswer nothing ?
Truth is , I like my entertainmentthe better that 'twas no better .
Now the gods forbid that thisopinion should run in a blood !
Have not you heard this principle, All things by strife engender ?
Dogs and cats do .
And men and women too .
Well , brother , in earnest ; you have now set your confidence to school , from whence I hope 't has brought home such a lesson as will instruct his master never after to begin such attempts as endin laughter .
Well , sir , you lessen my confi- dence , still ; I pray heavens your confidence have not more shallow ground for that Iknow , than mine you reprehend so .
My confidence ? in what ?
May-be you trust too much .
Lys Wherein ?
In human frailty .
Why , brother , know you ought that may impeach my confidence , as this success may yours ? Hath your observa - tion discovered any such frailty in my wife ( for that is your aim I know ) ? then let meknow it .
Good , good . Nay , brother , I write no books of observations ; let your confidence bear out itself , as mine shallme .
That 's scarce a brother 's speech .
If there be ought wherein your brother 's good might any way be questioned , canyou conceal it from his bosom ?
So , so . Nay , my saying was butgeneral . I glanced at no particular .
Then must I press you further .
You spake ( as to yourself , but yet I over- heard ) , as if you knew some disposition ofweakness where I most had fixed my trust .
I challenge you to let me know what 'twas .
Brother , are you wise ?
Be ignorant . Did you never hearof Actaeon ?
What then ?
Curiosity was his death . He could not be content to adore Diana in her temple , but lie must needs dog her to her retired pleasures , and see her in her naked - ness . Do you enjoy the sole privilege of your wife 's bed ? have you no pretty Paris for your page ? no young Adonis to frontyou there ?
I think none ; I know not .
Know not still , brother . Ignor- ance and credulity are your sole means to obtain that blessing . You see your greatest clerks , your wisest politicians are not that way fortunate ; your learned lawyers would lose a dozen poor men 's causes to gain a leaf an't , but for a term . Your physician is jealous of his . Your sages in general , by seeing too much , oversee that happi- ness . Only your blockheadly tradesman , your honest-meaning citizen , your nott- headed country gentleman , your unappre - hending stinkard , is blessed with the sole prerogative of his wife 's chamber , for which he is yet beholding , not to his stars , but to his ignorance . For , if he be wise ,brother , I must tell you the case alters .
How do you relish these things , brother ?
Passing ill .
So do sick men solid meats . Harkyou , brother , are you not jealous ?
No ; do you know cause to makeme ?
Hold you there . Did your wife never spice your broth with a dram of sublimate ? hath she not yielded up thefort of her honour to a staring soldado ?
and , taking courage from her guilt , played open bankrout of all shame , and run the country with him ? Then bless your stars , bow your knees to Juno . Look where sheappears .
We have sought you long , sir there 's a messenger within hath brought you letters from the Court , and desiresyour speech .
I can discover nothing in her looks .
Go , I 'll not be long .
Sir , it is of weight , the bearer saysand besides , much hastens his departure .
Honourable brother ! cry mercy ! what , in a conqueror 's style ? but come and overcome ?
A fresh course .
Alas ! you see of how slight metalwidow 's vows are made .
And that shall you prove too ereong .
Yet for the honour of our sex , boast not abroad this your easy conquest ; another might perhaps have stayed longer below stairs , it was but your confidence that surprised her love .
My uncle hath instructed me how to accost an honourable lady ; to win her , notby suit , but by surprise .
The whelp and all .
Good uncle , let not your near honours change your manners ; be not for- getful of your promise to me touching your lady 's daughter , Laodice . My fancy runsso upon't that I dream every night of her .
A good chicken ! go thy ways , thou hast done well ; eat bread with thymeat .
Come , sir , will you in ?
I 'll follow you .
I 'll not stir a foot without you . Icannot satisfy the messenger 's impatience .
Of what ?

So , there 's veney for veney , I have given't him ith ' speeding place for all his con- fidence . Well , out of this perhaps there maybe moulded matter of more mirth than my baffling . It shall go hard but I 'll make my constant sister act as famous a scene as Virgil did his mistress , who caused all the fire in Rome to fail , so that none couldlight a torch but at her nose . Now forth .
At this house dwells a virtuous dame , sometimes of worthy fame , now like a de- cayed merchant turned broker , and retailsrefuse commodities for unthrifty gallants .
Her wit I must employ upon this business to prepare my next encounter , but in sucha fashion as shall make all split . Ho !
Madam Arsace , pray heaven the oyster- wives have not brought the news of my wooing hither amongst their stale pilchards , Enter Arsace , Tomasin .
What , my lord of the palace ?
Look you .
Why , this was done like a beatensoldier .
Hark , I must speak with you . Ihave a share for you in this rich adventure .
You must be the ass charged with crowns to make way to the fort , and I the con-

Is't come to that ? Why , Tomasin .
Madam .
Did not one of the countess 's servingmen tell us that this gentleman was sped ?
That he did ; and how her honour graced and entertained him in very familiarmanner .
And brought him downstairs herself .
Ay , forsooth , and commanded hermen to bear him out of doors .
" Slight , pelted with rotten eggs ?
Nay , more ; that he had alreadypossessed her sheets .
No, indeed , mistress , 'twas herblankets .
Out , you young hedgesparrow ,learn to tread afore you be fledge !
{ He kicks her out .
Well , have you done now , lady ?
O , my sweet kilbuck .
You now , in your shallow pate , think this a disgrace to me ; such a disgrace as is a battered helmet on a soldier 's head , it doubles his resolution . Say , shall I usethee ?
Use me ?
O , holy reformation ! how art thou fallen down from the upper bodies ofthe church to the skirts of the city !
Honesty is stripped out of his true substance into verbal nicety . Common sinners startle at common terms , and they that by whole mountains swallow down the deeds of darkness , a poor mote of a familiar word makes them turn up thewhite o'th ' eye . Thou art the lady 's tenant ?
For term , sir .
A good induction : be successful for me , make me lord of the palace , and thou shalt hold thy tenement to thee and thine heirs for ever , in free smockage , as of the manner of panderage , provided always Ars . Nay , if you take me unprovided .
Provided , I say , that thou makest thy repair to her , presently , with a plot I will instruct thee in ; and for thy surer access to her greatness , thou shalt presenther , as from thyself , with this jewel .
So her old grudge stand not betwixther and me .
Fear not that .
Lysander , Tharsalio .

I said not so .
By truth itself , you did ; I over- heard you . Come , it shall nothing move me , whatsoever it be ; pray thee unfoldbriefly what you know .
Why , briefly , brother , I know my sister to be the wonder of the earth , and the envy of the heavens ; virtuous , loyal , and what-not . Briefly , I know she hath vowed that till death and after death she 'll hold inviolate her bonds to you , and that her black shall take no other hue , all which I firmly believe . In brief , brother , I know her to be a woman . But you know , brother , I have other irons on theanvil . \Exiturus .
You shall not leave me so unsatisfied ; tell me what 'tis you know .
Why , brother , if you be sure ot your wife 's loyalty for term of life , why should you be curious to search the alma nacks for aftertimes , whether some wandering ^Eneas should enjoy your reversion ;
or whether your true turtle would sit mourning on a withered branch , till Atropos cut her throat . Beware of curio- sity , for who can resolve you ? you 'll sayperhaps her vow .
Perhaps I shall .
Tush , herself knows not what she shall do , when she is transformed into a widow . You are now a sober and staid gentleman . But if Diana for your curiosity should translate you into a monkey , doyou know what gambols you should play ?
your only way to be resolved is to die andmake trial of her .
A dear experiment ; then I mustrise again to be resolved .
You shall not need . I can send you speedier advertisement of her constancy by the next ripier that rides that way withmackerel . And so I leave you .

315 has given me a bone to tire on with a pestilence ; 'slight know ?
What can he know ? what can his eye ob - serve More than mine own , or the most piercing sight That ever view 'd her ? by this light I think Her privatest thought may dare the eye of heaven , And challenge th ' envious world to wit- ness it , I know him for a wild , corrupted youth , Whom profane ruffians , squires to bawds ,and strumpets ;
Drunkards , spew 'd out of taverns into th ' sinks Of tap-houses and stews , revolts frommanhood .
Debauch 'd perdus , have by their com- panies Turn 'd devil like themselves , and stuff 1 d his soul With damn 'd opinions and unhallow 'd thoughts Of womanhood , of all humanity , Nay , deity itself .
Welcome , friend Lycus .
Have you met with your capriciousbrother ?
He parted hence but now .
And has he yet resolved you of thatpoint you brake with me about ?
Yes , he bids me die for furthertrial of her constancy .
Lye . That were a strange physic for a jealous patient ; to cure his thirst with a draught of poison . Faith , sir , discharge your thoughts an't ; think 'twas but a buzz devised by him to set your brains awork ,and divert your eye from his disgrace .
The world hath written your wife in highest lines of honoured fame ; her virtues so ad- mired in this isle , as the report thereof sounds in foreign ears ; and strangers oft arriving here , as some rare sight , desire to view her presence , thereby to compare thepicture with the original .
Nor think he can turn so far rebel to his blood , Or to the truth itself to misconceive Her spotless love and loyalty ; perhaps Oft having heard you hold her faith so sacred , As you being dead , no man might stir a sparkOf virtuous love , in way of second bonds ;
As if you at your death should carry with you Both branch and root of all affection .
' T may be , in that point he 's an infidel , And thinks your confidence may overween .
So think not I.
Nor I , if ever any made it good .
I am resolved of all , she 'll prove no changeling .
Well , I must yet be further satisfied ;
And vent this humour by some strain of wit ;
Somewhat I 'll do , but what I know notyet . \Exeunt .
Passion of virginity , lanthe , how shall we quit ourselves of this pandressthat is so importunate to speak with us ?
Is she known to be a pandress ?
Ay , as well as we are known to bewaiting-women .
A shrew take your comparison !
Let 's call out Argus , that bold ass , that never weighs what he does or says , but walks and talks like one in a sleep , to relate her attendance to my lady , andpresent her .
Who , an't please your honour ?
None so fit to set on any dangerousexploit . Ho ! Argus !
What 's the matter , wenches ?
You must tell my lady here 's a gentlewoman called Arsace , her honour 's tenant , attends her , to impart importantbusiness to her .
Well , she has a welcome present to bear out her unwelcome presence ; and I never knew but a good gift would welcomea bad person to the purest . An&gt ;ace !
Ay , mistress .
Give me your present ; I 'll do all I can to make way both for it and yourself .
You shall bind me to your service ,lady .
Stand unseen .
Argus coining to Eudora .
Here 's a gentlewoman ( an't please
What tenant ? What 's her name ?
Arsace , she says , madam .
Arsace ? What , the bawd ?

Out , ass ! know 'st not thou thepandress , Arsace ?
She presents your honour with thisjewel .
This jewel ? How came she by such a jewel ? She has had great customers .
She had need , madam ; she sits ata great rent .
Alas , for your great rent ; I 'll keep her jewel , and keep you her out , ye werebest : speak to me for a pandress ?
What shall we do ?
Go to ; let us alone . Arsace !
Ay , lady .
You must pardon us , we cannotobtain your access .
Mistress Sthenio , tell her honour , if I get not access to her , and that instantly ,she 's undone .
This is something of importance .
Madam , she swears your honour is undone ,if she speak not with you instantly .
Undone ?
Pray her , for her honour 's sake ,to give me instant access to her .
She makes her business your honour , madam ; and entreats , for the good of that ,her instant speech with you .
How comes my honour in question ?
Bring her to me .
Our Cyprian goddess save yourgood honour !
Stand you off , I pray . How dare you , mistress , importune access to me thus , considering the last warning I gave foryour absence ?
Because , madam , I have been moved by your honour 's last most chaste admonition to leave the offensive life I led before .
Ay ? have you left it then ?
Ay , I assure your honour , unless it be for the pleasure of two or three poor ladies , that have prodigal knights to theirhusbands .
Out on thee , impudent !
Alas , madam , we would all be gladto live in our callings .
Is this the reformed life thou talkeston ?
I beseech your good honour mistake me not , I boast of nothing but my charity ,that 's the worst .
You get these jewels with charity , no doubt . But what 's the point in whichmy honour stands endangered , I pray ?
In care of that , madam , I have pre - sumed to offend your diaste eyes with my presence . Hearing it reported for truth and generally , that your honour will take to husband a young gentleman of this citycalled Tharsalio .
I take him to husband ?
Ars , If your honour does , you are utterly undone , for he 's the most incontinent ; and insatiate man of women that ever Venusblessed with ability to please them .
Let him be the devil ; I abhor his thought , and could I be informed particu larly of any of these slanderers of mine honour , he should as dearly dare it as anything wherein his life were endangered .
Madam , the report of it is so strongly confident , that I fear the strong destiny of marriage is at work in it . But if it be , madam , let your honour 's known virtues resist and defy it for him : for not a hun- dred will serve his one turn . I protest to your honour , when ( Venus pardon me ) I winked at my unmaidenly exercise , I have known nine in a night made mad with hislove .
What , tell 'st thou me of his love ? I tell thee I abhor him ; and destiny must have another mould for my thoughts than Nature or mine honour , and a witchcraft above both , to transform me to another shape , as soon as to another conceit ofhim .
Then is your good honour just as I pray for you ; and good madam , even for your virtue 's sake , and comfort of all your dignities and possessions , fix your whole womanhood against him . He will so en- chant you , as never man did woman : nay , a goddess ( say his light huswives ) is notworthy of his sweetness .
Go to , begone .
Dear madam , your honour 's most perfect admonitions have brought me to such a hate of these imperfections , that I could not but attend you with my duty , and 'urge his unreasonable manhood to thefill .
Manhood , quoth you ?
Nay , beastlihood , I might say , indeed , madam , but for saving yourhonour ; nine in a night , said I ?
Go to , no more .
317 Ars . No more , madam ? that 's enough ,one would think .
Well , begone , I bid thee .
Alas , madam , your honour is the chief of our city , and to whom shall I com- plain of these inchastities ( being your ladyship 's reformed tenant ) but to you thatare chastest ?
I pray thee go thy ways , and let me see this reformation you pretend continued .
I humbly thank your good honour,that was first cause of it .
Here 's a complaint as strange asmy suitor .
I beseech your good honour thinkUpon him , make him an example .
Yet again ?
All my duty to your excellence .


You must complain to his Altitude .
All this for trial is ; you must en- dure That will have wives , nought else withthem is sure . \Exit .
Tharsalio , Arsace .
Hast thou been admitted , then ?
Admitted ? ay , into her heart , I 'll able it ; never was man so praised with a dispraise ; nor so spoken for in being railed on . I 'll give you my word , I have set her heart upon as tickle a pin as the needle of a dial , that will never let it resttill it be in the right position .
Why dost thou imagine this ?
Because I saw Cupid shoot in mywords , and open his wounds in her looks .
Her blood went and came of errands betwixt her face and her heart , and these changes I can tell you are shrewd telltales .
Thou speak 'st like a doctress in thy faculty ; but , howsoever , for all this foil I 'll retrieve the game once again . He 's a shallow gamester that for one displeasingcast gives up so fair a game for lost .
Well , 'twas a villanous invention of thine , and had a swift operation ; it took like sulphur . And yet this virtuous coun- tess hath to my ear spun out many a tedious lecture of pure sister 's thread against concupiscence ; but ever with such an affected zeal as my mind gave me she had a kind of secret titillation to grace my poor house sometimes , but that she feared a spice of the sciatica , which , asyou know , ever runs in the blood .
And , as you know , soaks into the bones . But to say truth , these angry heats that break out at the lips of these strait-laced ladies , are but as symptomsof a lustful fever that boils within them .
For wherefore rage wives at their husbands so when they fly out ? for zeal against thesin ?
No, but because they did notpurge that sin .
Th'art a notable siren , and I swear to thee , if I prosper , not only to give thee thy manor-house gratis , but to marry thee to some one knight or other , and bury thy trade in thy ladyship . Go ,begone . \Exit Arsace .
What news , Lycus ? where 's thelady ?
Retired into her orchard .
A pregnant badge of love , she 'smelancholy .
Lye , ' Tis with the sight of her Spartan wooer . But howsoever 'tis with her , youhave practised strangely upon your brother .
Why so ?
You had almost lifted his wit off the hinges . That spark jealousy , falling into his dry , melancholy brain , had wellnear set the whole house on fire .
No matter , let it work ; I did but pay him in 's own coin . 'Sfoot , he plied me with such a volley of unseasoned scoffs , as would have made patience itself turn ruffian , attiring itself in wounds and blood . But is his humour better qualified ,then ?
Yes , but with a medicine ten parts more dangerous than the sickness : you know how strange his dotage ever was on his wife ; taking special glory to have her love and loyalty to him so renowmed abroad . To whom she oftentimes hath vowed constancy after life , till her own death hath brought , forsooth , her widow- troth to bed . This he joyed in strangely , and was therein of infallible belief , till
As how , man ? as how ?
Lye , He is resolved to follow your advice ,to die , and make trial of her stableness ;
and you must lend your hand to it .
What , to cut 's throat ?
To forge a rumour of his death , to uphold it by circumstance , maintain a public face of mourning , and all thingsappertaining .
Ay , but the means , man . Whattime ? what probability ?
Nay , I think he has not licked his whelp into full shape yet , but you shallshortly hear on't .
And when shall this strange conception see light ?
Forthwith ; there 's nothing stays him ' but some odd business of import , which he must wind up ; lest perhaps his absence by occasion of his intended trialbe prolonged above his aims .
Thanks for this news , i'faith .
This may perhaps prove happy to my nephew . Truth is , I love my sister well and must acknowledge her more than ordi nary virtues . But she hath so possessed my brother 's heart with vows and disavowings , sealed with oaths of second nuptials ;
as in that confidence , he hath invested her in all his state , the ancient inheritance of our family ; and left my nephew and the rest to hang upon her pure devotion ; so as he dead , and she matching ( as I am resolved she will ) with some young prodigal ;
what must ensue , but her post-issue beg- gared , and our house , already sinking , buried quick in ruin . But this trial may remove it ; and since 'tis come to this , mark but the issue , Lycus , for all these solemn vows , if I do not make her prove in the handling as weak as a wafer , say I lost my time in travail . This resolution , then , has set his wits in joint again ; he 'squiet .
Yes , and talks of you again in the fairest manner ; listens after your speed Tha . Nay , he 's passing kind ; but I amglad of this trial , for all that .
Which he thinks to be a flightbeyond your wing .
" But he will change that thought ere long . My bird you saw even now sings me good news , and makes hopeful signs tome .
Somewhat can I say too . Since your messenger 's departure her ladyship hath been something altered more pensive than before and took occasion to question of you , what your addictions were ? of what taste your humour was ? of what cut you wore your wit ? and all this in a kindof disdainful scorn .
Good callenders , Lycus . Well , I 'll pawn this jewel with thee , my next encounter shall quite alter my brother 's !
Come , let 's in ; he shall com- !
mend it for a discreet and honourable ,attempt .
Men 's judgments sway on that side fortune leans, Thy wishes shall assist me .
Argus , Clinias , Sthenio , lanthe .
I must confess I was ignorant what 'twas to court a lady till now .
And I pray you , what is it now ?
To court her , I perceive , is to woo her with letters from Court ; for so thisSpartan lord 's Court discipline teacheth .
His lordship hath procured a newpacket from his Altitude .
If he bring no better ware than letters in 's packet , I shall greatly doubt ofhis good speed .
If his lordship did but know how gracious his aspect is to my lady in thissolitary humour .
Well , these retired walks of hers are not usual , and bode some alteration in her thoughts . What may be the cause ,Sthenio ?
Nay , 'twould trouble Argus with hishis hundred eyes to descry the cause .
Venus keep her upright , that she fall not from the state of her honour ; my fear is that some of these serpentine suitors will tempt her from her constant vow of widowhood . If they do , good night to ourgood days .
' Twere a sin to suspect her ; I have been witness to so many of her fearful pro- testations to our late lord against that course ; to her infinite oath imprinted on his lips , and sealed in his heart with such imprecations to her bed , if ever it should receive a second impression ; to her open and often detestations of that incestuouslife ( as she termed it ) of widows ' marriages ;
as being but a kind of lawful adultery ;
Well , for vows , they are gone to heaven with her husband , they bind not upon earth : and as for women 's resolu- tions , I must tell you , the planets , and ( as Ptolemy says ) the winds have a great stroke in them . Trust not my learning if her late strangeness and exorbitant solitudeI be not hatching some new monster .
Well applied , Argus ; make youhusbands monsters ?
I spoke of no husbands : but you wenches have the pregnant wits to turn monsters into husbands , as you turn husbands into monsters .
Well , lanthe , 'twere high time we made in , to part our lady and her Spartanwooer .
We shall appear to her like the two fortunate stars in a tempest , to save theshipwrack of her patience .
Ay , and to him too , I believe ; for by this time he hath spent the last dram of hisnews .
That is , of his wit .
Just , good \vittols .
If not , and that my lady be not too deep in her new dumps , we shall hear from his lordship , what such a lord said of his wife the first night he embraced her ; to what gentleman such a count was behold - ing for his fine children ; what young lady , such an old count should marry ; whatrevels , what presentments , are towards ;
and who penned the Pegmas ; and so forth : and yet for all this , I know her harsh suitor hath tired her to the uttermost scruple of her forbearance , and will do more , unless we two , like a pair of shears , cut asunderthe thread of his discourse .
Well then , let 's in ; but , my masters , wait you on your charge at your perils , see that you guard her approach from anymore intruders .
Excepting young Tharsalio .
True , excepting him indeed , for a guard of men is not able to keep him out ,an't please your honour .
Oh , wenches , that 's the property of true valour , to promise like a pigmy , and perform like a giant . If he come , I 'll be sworn I 'll do my lady 's commandmentupon him .
What ! beat him out ?
If he should , Tharsalio would not take it ill at his hands , for he does but hislady 's commandment .
Well , by Hercules , he comes nothere .
By Venus , but he does : or else she hath heard my lady 's prayers , and sent some gracious spirit in his likeness to fright away that Spartan wooer that hauntsher .
There stand her sentinels .
' Slight , the ghost appears again .
Save ye , my quondam fellows inarms ; save ye , my women !
Your women , sir ?
' Twill be so . What , no curtseys ?
No preparation of grace ? observe me , Iiadvise you for your own sakes .
For your own sake , I advise you to pack hence , lest your impudent valour costyou dearer than you think .
What senseless boldneso is this , .
Tharsalio ?
Well said , Clinias , talk to him .
I wonder that notwithstanding the shame of your last entertainment , and threatenings of worse , you would yet presume to trouble this place again .
Come , y 'are a widgeon ; off with your hat , sir ; acknowledge forecast isbetter than labour . Are you squint-eyed ?
can you not see afore you ? A little fore- sight I can tell you might stead you , muchas the stars shine now .
' Tis well , sir , 'tis not for nothing your brother is ashamed on you . But , sir , you must know , we are charged to baryour entrance .
But , whiffler , know you , that whoso shall dare to execute that charge , I 'll behis executioner .
By Jove , Clinias , methinks the gentleman speaks very honourably .
Well , I see the house needs refor- mation ; here 's a fellow stands behind now of a forwarder insight than ye all . Whatplace hast thou ?
What place you please , sir .
Law you , sir . Here 's a fellow to make a gentleman usher , sir . I discharge you of the place , and do here invest thee into his room . Make much of thy hair , thy wit will suit it rarely . And for the full pos- session of thine office , come , usher me to thy lady ; and to keep thy hand supple ,take this from me .
320
Go to , thou dost well ; but pocket it for all that ; it 's no impair to thee ; thegreatest do 't .
Sir , 'tis your love only that I respect , but since out of your love you please to be- stow it upon me , it were want of courtship in me to refuse it ; I 'll acquaint my ladywith your coming . \_Exit Arg .
How say by this ? have not I made I a fit choice , that hath so soon attained the ! deepest mystery of his profession ? good i sooth , wenches , a few curtseys had not ' been cast away upon your new lord , i St . We 'll believe that , when our lady ! has a new son of your getting .
What 's the matter ; who 's that , youi say , is come ?
The bold gentleman , and pleasei your honour .
Why , thou fleering ass , thou !
An't please your honour .
Did not I forbid his approach byi all the charge and duty of thy service ?
Madam , this fellow only is intelli- gent ; for he truly understood his com- mand according to the style of the Court of Venus ; that is , by contraries : when youforbid you bid .
By heaven , I 'll discharge my houseof ye all .
You shall not need , madam , for I have already cashiered your officious usherhere , and choosed this for his successor .
O incredible boldness !
Madam , I come not to command your love with enforced letters , nor to woo rwith tedious stories of my pedigree , as who draws the thread of his descent from Leda 's distaff , when 'tis well knownhis grandsire cried coneyskins in Sparta .
Whom mean you , sir ?
Sir , I name none , but him whofirst shall name himself .
The place , sir , I tell you still , and this goddess 's fair presence , or else myreply should take a far other form upon't .
If it should , sir , I would make yourlordship an answer .
Anser 's Latin for a goose , an'tplease your honour .
Well noted , gander ; and what of that ?
Nothing , an't please your honour , | but that he said he would make his lordshipi on answer .
Thus every fool mocks my poor suitor . Tell me , thou most frontless of all men , didst thou ( when thou hadst means to note me best ) ever observe so base a temper in me as to give any glance atstooping to my vassal ?
Your drudge , madam , to do yourdrudgery .
Or am I now so scant of worthy suitors that may advance mine honour , ad- vance my estate , strengthen my alliance ( if I list to \ved ) that I must stoop to makemy foot my head ?
No, but your side , to keep you warm a-bed . But , madam , vouchsafe meyour patience to that point 's serious answer .
Though I confess to get higher place in your graces , I could wish my fortunes more honourable , my person more gracious , my mind more adorned with noble and heroical virtues , yet , madam ( that you think not your blood disparaged by mixture with mine ) , deign to know this ; howsoever , I once , only for your love , disguised myself in the service of your late lord and mine , yet my descent is as honourable as the proudest of your Spar- tan attempters , who , by unknown quills or conduits undergound , draws his pedi- gree from Lycurgus his great toe to the Viceroy 's little finger , and from thence to hisown elbow , where it will never leave itching .
" Tis well , sir ; presume still of theplace .
'Sfoot , madam , am I the first great personage that hath stooped to disguises for love ? What think you of our country - man Hercules , that for love put on Om - phale 's apron and sat spinning amongst her wenches , while his mistress wore his lion 's skin , and lamb-skinned him if he didnot his business ?
Most fitly thou resemblest thyself to that violent outlaw that claimed all other men 's possessions as his own by his merevalour . For what less hast thou done ?
Come into my house , beat away these honourable persons Tha . That I will , madam . Hence , yeSparta-velvets !
Hold , she did not mean so .
Away , I say , or leave your lives , Iprotest , here .
Well , sir , his Altitude shall know you .
I 'll do your errand , sir . \Exeunt .
Do , good cousin Altitude , and beg the reversion of the next lady , for Dido lias betrothed her love to me . By this fair hand , madam , a fair riddance of this Calidonian boar .
O most prodigious audaciousness !
True , madam ; O fie upon 'em , they are intolerable . And I cannot but admire your singular virtue of patience , not common in your sex , and must there - fore carry with it some rare endowment of other masculine and heroical virtues . To hear a rude Spartan court so ingenuous a lady , with dull news from Athens or the Viceroy 's Court ; how many dogs were spoiled at the last bull-baiting ; what ladiesdubbed theirhusbands knights , and so forth .
But hast thou no shame ? no sense of what disdain I showed thee in my last entertainment ? chasing thee from my pre - sence , and charging thy duty not to attempt the like intrusion for thy life ; and darest thou yet approach me in this unmannerly manner ? No question this desperate bold - ness cannot choose but go accompaniedwith other infinite rudenesses .
Good madam , give not the child an unfit name , term it not boldness which the sages call true confidence , founded on the most infallible rock of a woman 's constancy .
If shame cannot restrain thee , tell me yet if any brainless fool would have tempted the danger attending thy approach .
No, madam , that proves I am no fool : then had I been here a fool , and a base , low-spirited Spartan , if foralady 's , ora lord 's threats , or for a guard of grooms , I should have shrunk in the wetting , and suffered such a delicious flower to perish in the stalk , or to be savagely plucked by a pro- fane finger . No, madam : first , let me be made a subject for disgrace ; let your re - morseless guard seize on my despised body , bind me hand and foot , and hurl me intoyour ladyship 's bed .
O gods ! I protest thou dost moreand more make me admire thee .
Madam , ignorance is the mother of admiration : know me better , and you 'llj admire me less .
What would 'st thou have me know ?
i what seeks thy coming ? why dost thouhaunt me thus ?
Only , madana , that the ^Etna of my sighs , and Nilus of my tears , poured forth in your presence , might witness to your honour the hot and moist affection of my heart , and work me some measure of favour from your sweet tongue , or your sweeter lips , or what else your good lady- ship shall esteem more conducible to yourdivine contentment .
Pen and ink-horn , I thank thcc .
This you learned when you were a servingman .
Madam , I am still the same crea - ture ; and I will so tie my whole fortunes to that style , as were it my happiness ( as I know it will be ) to mount into my lord 's succession , yet vow I never to assume other title , or state , than your servants : not approaching your board , but bidden : not pressing to your bed , but your pleasure shall be first known if you will commandme any service .
Thy vows are as vain as a ruffian 's oaths ; as common as the air ; and as cheap as the dust . How many of the light huswives , thy muses , hath thy love promised this service besides , I pray thee ?
Compare shadows to bodies , ma - dam ; pictures to the life ; and such arethey to you , in my valuation .
I see words will never free me of thy boldness , -and will therefore now use blows ; and those of the mortallest enforce - ment . Let it suffice , sir , that all this time ,and to this place , you enjoy your safety ;
keep back ; no one foot follow me further ;
Dare my love with death ?
' Slight ; follow , an't please yourhonour .
Not I , by this light .
I hope , gentlewomen , you will .
Not we , sir , we are no parters effrays .
Would any heart of adamant , for satisfaction of an ungrounded humour , rack a poor lady 's innocence as you intend to do ? It was a strange curiosity in that Emperor , that ripped his mother 's womb tosee the place he lay in .
Come , do not load me with volumes of persuasion ; I am resolved : if she be 3 22
Sir .
I pray thee , wife , show but thy- self a woman , and be silent ; question no more the reason of my journey , which our great Viceroy 's charge , urged in this letter ,doth enforce me to .
Let me but see that letter . There is something in this presaging blood of mine , tells me this sudden journey can portend no good ; resolve me , sweet ; have not I given you cause of discontent , by some misprision , or want of fit observance ? Let me know , that I may wreak myself uponmyself .
Come , wife , our love is now grown old and staid , And must not wanton it in tricks of court , Nor interchanged delights of melting lovers ;
Hanging on sleeves , sighing , loth to depart ;
These toys are past with us ; our true love 's substance Hath worn out all the show ; let it suffice , I hold thee dear : and think some cause of weight , With no excuse to be dispensed withal , Compels me from thy most desired embraces .
I stay but for my brother ; came he not in last night ?
For certain no , sir , which gave us cause of wonder what accident kept himabroad .
Pray heaven it prove not some wild resolution , bred in him by his second repulse from the Countess .
Trust me I something fear it , this insatiate spirit of aspiring being so dan- gerous and fatal ; desire mounted on thewings of it , descends not but headlong .
Sir , sir , here 's my uncle .
What , wrapt in careless cloak , face hid in hat unbanded ! these are the ditches , brother , in which outraging colts plungeboth themselves and their riders .
Well , we must get out as well aswe may ; if not , there 's the making of ;
grave saved .
That 's desperately spoken , brother .
had it not been happier the colt had beenbetter broken , and his rider not fallen in .
True , sister , but we must ride coltsbefore we can break them , you know .
This is your blind goddess , Confidence .
Alas , brother , our house is de- cayed , and my honest ambition to restore t , I hope be pardonable . My comfort s : the poet that pens the story will writeo 'er my head magnis /amen excidit an sis ;
hich in our native idiom , lets you know His mind was high , though Fortune was his foe .
A good resolve , brother , to out-jest disgrace : come , I had been on my journey Dut for some private speech with you : let 's n .
Good brother , stay a little , helpout this ragged colt out of the ditch .
How now ?
Now I confess my oversight , thishave I purchased by my confidence .
I like you , brother , 'tis the true garb , you know , What wants in real worth supply in show .
In show ? alas , 'twas even the thing itself ;
I oped my counting house , and took awayThese simple fragments of my treasury .
" Husband , " my Countess cried , "take more , more yet , " Yet I , in haste , to pay in part my debt , And prove myself a husband of her store , Kiss 'd and came off , and this time took no more .
But good brother .
Then were our honour 'd spousal rites perform 'd , We made all short , and sweet , and close , and sure .
He 's wrapt .
Then did my ushers and chief ser- vants stoop , Then made my women curtseys , and enviedTheir lady 's fortune : I was magnified .
Let him alone , this spirit will soon vanish .
Brother and sister , as I love you , and am true servant to Venus , all the pre - mises are serious and true , and the conclu- sion is : the great Countess is mine , the palace is at your service , to which I inviteyou all to solemnize my honoured nuptials .
Can this be credited ?
Good brother , do not you envy myfortunate achievement ?
Nay , I ever said the attempt wascommendable .
Good !
If the issue were successful .
A good state-conclusion ; happyevents make good the worst attemots .
323 n Here are your widow-vows , sister ; thus are ye all in your pure naturals ; certain moral disguises of coyness , which the igno - rant call modesty , ye borrow of art to cover your busk points ; which a blunt and reso- lute encounter , taken under a fortunate aspect , easily disarms you of ; and then , alas , what are you ? poor naked sinners , God wot ! weak paper walls thrust down with a finger ; this is the way on't , boil their appetites to a full height of lust ; andthen take them down in the nick .
Is there probability in this , that a lady so great , so virtuous , standing on so high terms of honour , should so soonstoop ?
You would not wonder , sister , if you knew the lure she stooped at : greatness ? think you that can curb affection ;
no , it whets it more ; they have the full stream of blood to bear them , the sweet gale of their sublimed spirits to drive them , the calm of ease to prepare them , the sun - shine of fortune to allure them , greatness to waft them safe through all rocks of infamy . When youth , wit , and person come aboard once , tell me , sister , can you choose but hoise sail , and put forward tothe main ?
But let me wonder at this frailty yet ; would she in so short time wear out his memory , so soon wipe from her eyes , nay , from her heart , whom I myself , and this whole isle besides , still remember with grief , the impression of his loss taking worthily such root in us ; how think you ,wife ?
I am ashamed an't , and abhor to think So great and vow 'd a pattern of our sex Should take into her thoughts , nay , to her bed( O stain to womanhood ! ) a second love .
In so short time .
In any time .
No, wife .
By Juno , no ; sooner a loathsometoad .
High words , believe me , and I think she 'll keep them ; next turn is yours , nephew ; you shall now marry my noblestlady-daughter ; the first marriage in Paphos ;
next my nuptials shall be yours . These are strange occurrents , brother , but pretty and pathetical ; if you see me in my chair of honour , and my Countess in mine arms , you will then believe , I hope , I am the lord of the palace , then shall you try my great lady 's entertainment ; see your hands freed of me , and mine taking you to advancement .
Well , all this rids not my business ;
wife , you shall be there to partake the un- expected honour of our house . Lycus and I will make it our recreation by the way , to think of your revels and nuptial sports .
Brother , my stay hath been for you . Wife , pray thee be gone , and soon prepare forthe solemnity ; a month returns me .
Heavens guide your journey !
Farewell .
Farewell , nephew ; prosper in virility ; but do you hear , keep your hand from your voice , I have a part for you inour hymeneal show .
You speak too late for my voice ;
but I 'll discharge the part .
\Exit Cynthia , Hylus .
Occurrents call ye them ? foul shame confound them all ! that impreg nable fort of chastity and loyalty , that amazement of the world , O ye deities , could nothing restrain her ? I took her spirit to be too haughty for such a depression .
But who commonly more shortheeled than they that are high i'th ' instep.
Methinks yet shame should havecontrolled so sudden an appetite .
Tush , shame doth extinguish lust as oil doth fire ;
The blood once hot , shame doth inflame the more , What they before by art dissembled most , They act more freely ; shame once found is lost ;
And to say truth , brother , what shame is due to't ? or what congruence doth it carry , that a young lady , gallant , vigorous , full of spirit and complexion ; her appetite new-whetted with nuptial delights , to be confined to the speculation of a death 's - head ; or for the loss of a husband , the world affording flesh enough , make the noontide of her years the sunset of herpleasures ?
And yet there have been suchwomen .
Of the first stamp , perhaps , v ,hc ;i
the metal was purer than in these de- generate days . Of later years , much of that coin hath been counterfeit , and be- sides , so cracked and worn with use , that they are grown light , and indeed fit fornothing but to be turned over in play .
Not all , brother .
My matchless sister only excepted .
324 For she , you know , is made of another metal than that she borrowed of her mother . But do you , brother , sadly intendthe pursuit of this trial ?
Irrevocably .
It 's a high project ; if it be once raised , the earth is too weak to bear so weighty an accident ; it cannot be conjured down again without an earthquake : therefore believe she will be constant .
No, I will not .
Then believe she will not be constant .
Neither ; I will believe nothing but what trial enforces . Will you hold your promise for the governing of this projectwith skill and secrecy ?
If it must needs be so . But hark you , brother ; have you no other capricions in your head to intrap my sister in her frailty , but to prove the firmness of herwidow vows after your supposed death ?
None in the world .
Then here 's my hand ; I 'll be as close as my lady 's shoe to her foot that pinches and pleases her , and will bear onwith the plot till the vessel split again .
Forge any death , so you can force belief .
Say I was poison 'd , drown 'd .
Hanged .
Anything ; so you assist it with likely circumstance , I need not instructyou ; that must be your employment , Lycus .
Well , sir .
But , brother , you must set in too ;
to countenance truth out , a hearse there must be too . It 's strange to think howmuch the eye prevails in such impressions ;
I have marked a widow , that just before was seen pleasant enough , follow anempty hearse , and weep devoutly .
All those things leave to me .
But , brother , for the bestowing of this hearse in the monument of our family ,and the marshalling of a funeral .
Leave that to my care , and if I do not do the mourner , as lively as your heir , and weep as lustily as your widow , say there 's no virtue in onions : that beingdone , I 'll come to visit the distressed widow ;
apply old ends of comfort to her grief , but the burden of my song shall be to tell her words are but dead comforts ; and therefore counsel her to take a living comfort ;
that might ferret out the thought of her dead husband , and will come prepared with choice of suitors ; either my Spartan lord for grace at the Viceroy 's Court , or some great lawyer that may solder up her cracked estate , and so forth . But what would you say , brother , if you should findher married at your arrival ?
By this hand , split her weasand .
Well , forget not your wager , a stately chariot with four brave horses ofthe Thracian breed , with all appurtenances .
I 'll prepare the like for you , if you prove victor . But well remembered , where willyou lurk the whiles ?
Mewed up close , some short day 'sjourney hence . Lycus shall know the place .
Write still how all things pass . Brother ,adieu ; all joy attend you !
Will you not stay our nuptial nowso near ?
I should be like a man that hears a tale And heeds it not ; one absent from him - self : my wife shall attend the countess , andmy son .
Whom you shall hear at your return call me father .
Adieu ; Jove be your speed .
My nuptials done , your funerals succeed .

A hall , a hall ! who 's without there ? \_Enter two or three with cushions . JCome on , y 'are proper grooms , are ye not ?
' Slight , I think y 'are all bridegrooms , ye take your pleasures so . A company of dormice ! Their honours are upon coming , and the room not ready . Rushes andseats instantly .
Now , alas , fellow Argus , how thouart cumbered with an office !
Perfume , sirrah , the room 's dampish .
Nay , you may leave that office tothe ladies , they 'll perfume it sufficiently .
Cry mercy , sir : here 's a whole chorus of Sylvans at hand , curveting and tripping ath ' toe , as the ground they trod on were too hot for their feet . The device is rare ; and there 's your young nephew too , he hangs in the clouds deified withHymen 's shape .
Is he perfect in 's part ? has not his tongue learned of the Sylvans to trip ath'toe ?
Sir , believe it , he does it preciously for accent and action , as if he felt the part he played ; he ravishes all the young wenches in the palace ; pray Venus my young lady Laodice have not some little prick of Cupid in her , she 's so diligent at 'srehearsals .
3 2 5 Tha . No force , for my next vows be heard , that if Cupid have pricked her ,Hymen may cure her .
You mean your nephew , sir , thatpresents Hymen .
Why so , I can speak nothing but thou art within me ; fie of this wit of thine , 'twill be thy destruction ! But howsoever you please to understand , Hymen send the boy no worse fortune ; and where 's mylady 's honour ?
At hand , sir , with your unpara - goned sister ; please you take your chair ofhonour , sir ?
Most serviceable Argus , the godsreward thy service ; for I will not .
Come , sister , now we must exchange that name For stranger titles , let 's dispose ourselves To entertain these sylvan revellers , That come to grace our loved nuptials .
I fear me we must all turn nymphs to-night , To side those sprightly wood-gods in their dances ;
Can you do 't nimbly , sister ? 'slight , what ail you , Are you not well ?
Yes , madam .
But your looks , Methinks , are cloudy ; suiting ill the sun - shine Of this clear honour to your husband 's house .
Is there aught here that sorts not with your liking ?
Blame her not , mistress , if her looks show care .
Excuse the merchant 's sadness that hath made A doubtful venture of his whole estate , His livelihood , his hopes , in one poor bottom , To all encounters of the sea and storms .
Had you a husband that you loved as well , Would you not take his absent plight as ill ?
Cavil at every fancy ? not an object That could present itself , but it would forge Some vain objection , that did doubt his safety : True love is ever full of jealousy .
Jealous ? of what ? of every little journey ?
Mere fancy , then , is wanton ; and doth cast At those slight dangers there , too doting glances ;
Misgiving minds ever provoke mischances .
Shines not the sun in his way bright as here ?
Is not the air as good ? what hazard doubt you ?
His horse may stumble , if it please your honour ;
The rain may wet , the wind may blow on him ;
Many shrewd hazards watch poor travellers .
True , and the shrewdest thou hast reckon 'd us , Good sister , these cares fit young married wives .
Wives should be still young in their husbands ' loves ;
Time bears no scythe should bear down them before him : Our lives he may cut short , but not our loves .
Sister , be wise , and ship not in one bark All your ability ; if he miscarry , Your well-tried wisdom should look out for new .
I wish them happy winds that run that course , From me 'tis far ; one temple seal 'd our troth ;
One tomb , one hour shall end , and shroud us both .
Well , y 'are a phoenix , there , be that your cheer : Love with your husband be , your wisdom here : Hark ! our sports challenge it ; sit , dearest mistress .
Take your place , worthiest servant .
As I my heavenly mistress : sit , rare sister .
Music : Hymen descends , and six Sylvansenter beneath , with torches .
A hall , a hall ! let no more citizens in there .
O , not my cousin sec ; but Hymen 's self .
He does become it most enflamingly .
Hail , honour 'd bridegroom , and his princely bride , With the most famed for virtue , Cynthia ;
And this young lady , bright Laodice , One rich hope of this noblest family .
Hark how he courts ; he is enamour 'd too .
Oh , grant it , Venus , and be everhonour 'd !
326 THE WIDOWS TEARS .

Sylvans ! the courtships you make to your Dryads Use to this great bride , and these other dames , And heighten with your sports , my nuptial flames .
O , would himself descend , and me command .
Dance ; and his heart catch in another 's hand .

Now , what the power and my torch 's influence Hath in the blessings of your nuptial joys ( Great bride and bridegroom ) you shall amply part Betwixt your free loves , and forego it never .
Tharsalio , Lycus , " with his arm in a scarf ,a night-cap oris head .
I hope , sir , by this timeTha . Put on , man , by ourselves .
The edge of your confidence is well taken off ; would you not be content towithdraw your wager ?
' Faith , fellow Lycus , if my wager were weakly built , this unexpected accident might stagger it . For the truth is , this strain is extraordinary , to follow her husband 's body into the tomb , and there , for his company , to bury herself quick ;
it 's new and stirring ; but for all this , I'llnot despair of my wager .
Why , sir , can you think such apassion dissembled ?
All 's one for that ; what I think I think . In the meantime , forget not to write to my brother , how the plot hath succeeded , that the news of his death hath taken , a funeral solemnity performed , his supposed corse bestowed in the monumentof our family , thou and I horrible mourners .
But above all , that his intolerable virtuous widow , for his love ; and ( for her love ) Ero , her handmaid , are descended with his corse into the vault , there wipe their eyes time out of mind , drink nothing but their own tears , and by this time are almost dead with famine . There 's a point will sting it ( for you say 'tis true ) : where leftyou him ?
At Dipolis , sir , some twenty mileshence .
He keeps close .
Ay , sir , by all means ; skulks unknown under the name of a strange knight .
That may carry him without des - crying , for there 's a number of strangeknights abroad . You left him well ?
Well , sir , but for this jealoushumour that haunts him .
Well , this news will absolutely purge that humour . Write all ; forget not to describe her passion at thy discovery of his slaughter : did she perform it well forher husband 's wager ?
Perform it , call you it ? You may jest ; men hunt hares to death for their sports , but the poor beasts die in earnest : you wager of her passions for your pleasure , but she takes little pleasure in those earnest passions . I never saw such an ecstasy 01sorrow , since I knew the name of sorrow .
Her hands flew up to her head like Furies , hid all her beauties in her dishevelled hair , and wept as she would turn fountain . I would you and her husband had been behind the arras but to have heard her . I assure you , sir , I was so transported with the spectacle , that in despite of my discretion , I was forcedto turn woman , and bear a part with her .
3 2 7 Humanity broke loose from my heart , andStreamed through mine eyes .
In prose , thou wept 'st . So have I seen many a moist auditordoat aplay ; when the story was but a mere fiction . And didst act the Nuntius well ? would I had heard it : could 'st thou dress thy looks in a mournfulhabit ?
Not without preparation , sir ; no more than my speech , 'twas a plain acting of an interlude to me , to pronounce thepart .
As how , for heaven 's sake ?
" Phoebus address 'd his chariot towards the West , To change his wearied coursers , " and so forth .
Nay on , and thou lovest me .
' ' Lysander and myself beguiled the way With interchanged discourse , but our chief theme Was of your dearest self , his honour 'd wife ;
Your love , your virtue , wondrous constancy . "
Then was her cue to whimper ;

' ' When suddenly appear 'd as far as sight A troop of horse , arm 'd , as we might dis cern , With javelins , spears , and such accoutrements .
He doubted nought ( as innocency everIs free from doubting ill . ) "
There dropt a tear .
" My mind misgave me They might be mountaineers . At their approach They used no other language but their weapons , To tell us what they were ; Lysander drew , And bore himself Achilles-like in fight , And as a mower sweeps off t ' heads of bents , So did Lysander 's sword shave off the points Of their assaulting lances .
His horse at last , sore hurt , fell under him ;
I seeing I could not rescue , used my spursTo fly away . "
What , from thy friend ?
Ay , in a good quarrel , why not ?
Good ; I am answer 'd .
" A lance pursued me , brought me back again ;
And with these wounds left me t 'accompany Dying Lysander : then they rifled us , And left us .
They gone , my breath not yet gone , 'gan to strive And revive sense ; I with my feeble joints Crawl 'd to Lysander , stirr 'd him , and withal He gasp 'd ; cried ' Cynthia ! ' and breathed no more . "
O then she howled outright !
" Passengers came , and in a chariot brought us Straight to a neighbour-town ; where I forthwith Coffin 'd my friend in lead : and so convey 'd himTo this sad place . "
' Twas well ; and could not show but strangely .
Well , sir , this tale pronounced with terror , suited with action clothed with such likely circumstance ; my wounds in show , her husband 's hearse in sight , think what effect it wrought ; and if you doubt , let the sad consequence of her retreat to histomb , be your woful instructor .
For all this , I 'll not despair of my wager : These griefs that sound so loud , prove always light, True sorrow evermore keeps out of sight .
This strain of mourning within a sepulchre , like an overdoing actor , affects grossly , and is indeed so far forced from the life , that itbewrays itself to be altogether artificial .
To set open a shop of mourning ! ' Tis palpable . Truth the substance , hunts not after the shadow of popular fame . Her officious ostentation of sorrow condemns her sincerity . When did ever woman mourn so unmeasurably , but she did dissemble ?
O gods ! a passion thus borne ;
thus apparelled with tears , sighs , swoon - ings , and all the badges of true sorrow , to be dissembled ! by Venus , I am sorry I ever set foot in't . Could she , if she dis - sembled , thus dally with hunger , be deaf to the barking of her appetite , not having these four days relieved nature with onedram of sustenance ?
For this does she look to be deified , to have hymns made of her , nay to her : the tomb where she is to be no more reputed the ancient monument of our family , the Lysandri , but the new-erected altar of Cynthia ; to which all the Paphian widows shall after their husbands ' funerals offer their wet muckinders , for monuments of the danger they have passed , as seamen 338 THE WIDOWS TEARS .

Lye , Well , I 'll apprehend you , at your pleasure ; I for my part will say , that if her faith be as constant as her love is hearty and unaffected , her viitues may justlychallenge a deity to enshrine them .
Ay , there 's another point , too .
But one of 'those virtues is enough at once .
All natures are not capable of all gifts . If the brain of the West were in the heads of the learned , then might parish clerks be common-councilmen , and poets aldermen 's deputies . My sister may turn Niobe for love ; but till Niobe be turned to a marble , I'll not despair but she may prove a woman .
Let the trial run on : if she do not outrun it , I 'll say poets are no prophets , prognos- ticators are but mountebanks , and nonetell true but wood-mongers . \Exit .
He discovers the tomb , looks in , andwonders , &amp;c .
O miracle of nature ! women 's glory , Men 's shame , and envy of the deities !
Yet must these matchless creatures be sus - pected , Accused , condemn 'd ! Now by the im - mortal gods , They rather merit altars , sacrifice , Than love and courtship .
Yet see , the Queen of these lies here in- terr 'd , Tearing her hair , and drowned in her tears .
Which Jove should turn to crystal , and -a mirror Make of them , wherein men may see and wonder At women 's virtues . Shall she famish ,then ?
Will men , without dissuasions , suffer thus So bright an ornament to earth , tomb 'd quick In earth 's dark bosom ? Ho ! who 's in the tomb there ?
Who calls ? whence are you ?
I am a soldier of the watch and must enter .
Amongst the dead ?
Do the dead speak ? Ope , or I 'll force it open .
What violence is this ? what seek you here , Where nought but death and her attendants dwell ?
What wretched souls are you , thatthus by night lurk here amongst the dead ?
Good soldier , do not stir her . She 's weak , and quickly seized with swooning and passions , and with much trouble shall we both recall her fainting spirits . Five days thus hath she wasted , and not onceseasoned her palate with the taste of meat ;
her powers of life are spent ; and what re - mains of her famished spirit , serves not tobreathe but sigh .
She hath exiled her eyes from sleep or sight , And given them wholly up to ceaseless tears , Over that ruthless hearse of her dear spouse ,Slain by bandittoes , nobly-born Lysander .
And hopes she with these heavynotes and cries to call him from the dead ?
in these five days hath she but made him stir a finger or fetch one gasp of that forsaken life she mourns ?
Come , honour 'd mistress , I admire your virtues , But must reprove this vain excess of moan .
Rouse yourself , lady , and look up from death .
Well said , 'tis well ; stay by my hand and rise .
This face hath been maintain 'd with better huswifery .
What are you ?
Lady , I am sentinel , Set 'in this hallow 'd place , to watch and guard On forfeit of my life , these monuments From rape and spoil of sacrilegious hands ;
And save the bodies , that without you see Of crucified offenders , that no friendsMay bear them hence to honour 'd burial .
Thou seem 'st an honest soldier ; pray thee then Be as thou seem 'st ; betake thee to thy charge , And leave this place ; add not afflictionTo the afflicted .
You misname the children .
329 Imposed upon yourself ; and you lament , As did the Satyr once , that ran affrighted From that horn 's sound that he himself had winded .
' Which humour to abate , my counsel tending your term 'd affliction ;
What I for physic give , you take for poison .
I tell you , honour 'd mistress , these in- gre 'dients Are wholesome , though perhaps they seem untoothsome .
This soldier , sure , is some decayed pothecary .
Dear ghost , be wise , and pity your fair self , Thus by yourself unnaturally afflicted ;
Chide back heart-breaking groans , clear up those lamps , Restore them to their first creation ;
Windows for light , not sluices made for tears , Beat not the senseless air with needless cries ,Baneful to life and bootless to the dead .
This is the inn where all Deucalion 's race ,Sooner or later , must take up their lodging .
No privilege can free us from this prison ;
No tears nor prayers can redeem from hence A captived soul ; make use of what you see : Let this affrighting spectacle of deathTeach you to nourish life .
Good hear him ; this is a rare soldier .
Say that with abstinence you should unloose The knot of life ; suppose that in this tomb For your dear spouse , you should entomb yourself A living corse ; say that before your hour , Without due summons from the Fates , you send Your hasty soul to hell ; can your dear spouse Take notice of your faith and constancy ?
Shall your dear spouse revive to give you thanks ?
Idle discourser !
No, your moans are idle .
Go to , I say , be counsejl 'd ; raise yourself ;
Enjoy the fruits of life , there 's viands for you .
Now , live for a better husband .
No ? will you none ?
For love of courtesy , good mistress , eat , Do not reject so kind and sweet an offer ;
Who knows but this may be some MercuryDisguised , and sent from Juno to relieve us ?
Did ever any lend unwilling earsTo those that came with messages of life ?
I pray thee leave thy rhetoric .
By my soul , to speak plain truth , I could rather wish t 'employ my teeth than my tongue , so your example would be mywarrant .
Thou hast my warrant .
Well then , eat , my wench , letobstinacy starve , fall to .
Persuade my mistress first .
' Slight , tell me , lady , Are you resolved to die ? If that be so , Choose not , for shame , a base and beggar 's death ;
Die not for hunger ; like a Spartan lady , Fall valiantly upon a sword , or drinkA noble death , expel your grief with poison .
There 'tis , seize it tush ! you dare not die .
Come , wench , Thou hast not lost a husband ; thou shalt eat ;
Th'art now within the place where Icommand .
I protest , sir .
Well said ; eat , and protest , or I 'll protest And do thou eat ; thou eat 'st against thy will, That 's it thou would 'st say ?
It is .
And under such a protestationThou lost thy maidenhead .
For your own sake , good lady , forget this husband .
Come , you are now become a happy widow, A blessedness that many would be glad of .
That and your husband 's inventory to - gether , Will raise you up husbands enow .
What think you of me ?
Trifler , pursue this wanton theme no further ;
Lest , which I would be loth , your speech provoke Uncivil language from me ; I must tell you , One joint of him I lost , was much more worthThan the rack 'd value of thy entire body .
I know what joint she means .
Well , I have done ;
And well done , frailty ; proface , * how likestthou it ?
Very toothsome ingredients surely ,sir ; want but some liquor to 5 n corporate them .
There 'tis , carouse .
I humbly thank you , sir .
Hold , pledge me now .


33
Do so , take it .
Sighing has made me something short-winded .
I 'll pledge y 'at twice .
' Tis well done ; do me right .
I pray , sir , have you been a pothe-
Marry have I , wench ; a woman 's pothecary .
Have you good ingredients ?
I like your bottle well . Good mistress , taste it .
Try but the operation , 'twill fetch upThe roses in your cheeks again .
Doctor Verolles ' bottles are not like it ;
There 's no guaiacum here , I can assure you ,Lys . This will do well anon .
Now fie upon't .
O , I have lost my tongue in this same limbo The spring ants spoil 'd methinks ; it goes not off With the old twang .
Well said , wench , oil it well ; 'twill make it slide well .
Aristotle says , sir , in his Poste- rionds Lys . This wench is learned ; and what says he ?
That when a man dies , the last thing that moves is his heart , in a womanher tongue .
Right ; and adds iurther , that you women are a kind of spinners ; if their legs be plucked off , yet still they 'll wag them ;
: so will you your tongues .
| With what an easy change does this same weakness j Of women slip from one extreme t ' another ?
\ All these attractions take no hold of her ;
No, not to take refection ; 't must not be thus .
Well said , wench ; tickle that Helicon .
But shall we quit the field with this disgrace Given to our oratory ? Both not gainSo much ground of her as to make her eat ?
Faith , the truth is , sir , you are no fit organ For this business ;
Tis quite out of your element .
Let us alone , she 'll eat , I have no fear :A woman 's tongue best fits a woman 's ear .
Jove never did employ Mercury , But Iris for his messenger to Juno .
Come , let me kiss thee , wench ;
wilt undertakeTo make thy mistress eat ?
It shall go hard , sir , But I will make her turn to flesh and blood , And learn to live as other mortals do .
Well said ; the morning hastes j next night expect me .
With more provision , good sir .
And bring more wine .

Thou all art soul ; all immortality .
Thou fast 'st for nectar and ambrosia ;
Which till thou find 'st , and eat 'st above the stars , To all food here thou bidd 'st celestial wars .

So ; let 's air our dampish spirits ,almost stifled in this gross muddy element .
How sweet a breath the calmness ofthe night inspires the air withal ?
Well said , now y 'are yourself ; did not I tell you how sweet an operation the soldier 's bottle had ? and if there be such virtue in the bottle , what is there in the soldier ? know , and acknowledge his worthwhen he comes in any case , mistress .
So , maid .
God 's my patience ! did you look torsooth that Juno should have sent you meat from her own trencher , in reward of your widow 's tears ? you might sit and sighfirst till your heart-strings broke , I 'll able 't .
I fear me thy lips have gone so oft to the bottle , that thy tongue-strings arecome broken home .
' Faith the truth is my tongue hath been so long tied up . that 'tis covered with rust , and I rub it against my palate , as we do suspected coins , to try whether it be current or no . But now , mistress , for an upshot of this bottle ; let 's have one carouse to the good speed of my old master , andthe good speed of my new .
So , damsel .
You must pledge it , here 's to it .
Do me right , I pray .
You say I must .
Must ? what else ?
How excellent ill this humour suitsour habit .
THE WIDOWS TEARS .

jest , when we are in private at home . I would to Venus we had some honest shift or other to get oft " withal ; for I 'll no more an't ; I 'll not turn saltpetre in this vault for never a man 's company living ; much less for a woman 's . Sure I am the wonder 's over , and 'twas only for that , that I endured this ; and so a my conscience didyou . Never deny it .
Nay , pray thee take it to thee .
Hark , I hear some footing near us .
God 's me , 'tis the soldier , mistress .
By Venus , if you fall to your late blackSantus again , I 'll discover you .
What 's here ? The maid hath certainly prevailed with her ; methinks those clouds that last night covered her looks are now dispersed . I 'll try thisfurther . Save you , lady !
Honourable soldier , y 'are welcome ;
please you step in , sir ?
With all my heart , sweetheart ; by your patience , lady . Why , this bears some shape of life yet . Damsel , th'ast performed a service of high reckoning , which cannotperish unrewarded .
' Faith , sir , you are in the way to doit once , if you have the heart to hold on .
Your bottle has poisoned this wench ,sir .
A wholesome poison it is , lady , if I may be judge ; of which sort here is onebetter bottle more .
Wine is ordain 'd to raise such hearts as sink ;
Whom woful stars distemper , let him drink .
I am most glad I have been some mean to this part of your recovery , and will drinkto the rest of it .
Go to , mistress ; pray simper nomore ; pledge the man of war here .
Come , y 'are too rude .
Good .
Good sooth , lady , y 'are honoured in her service . I would have you live , and she would have you live freely , without which life is but death . To live freely is to feast our appetites freely , without which humanes are stones ; to the satisfactionwhereof I drink , lady .
I 'll pledge you , sir .
Said like a mistress , and the mistress of yourself . Pledge him in love too ; I see he loves you ; she 's silent , she consents ,sir .
O happy stars ! And now pardon ,lady ; methinks these are all of a piece .
Nay , if you kiss all of a piece we shall ne 'er have done . Well , 'twas welloffered , and as well taken .
If the world should see this .
The world ! should one so rare asyourself respect the vulgar world ?
The praise I have had I would continue .
What of the vulgar ? Who hates not the vulgar deserves not love of the vir- tuous . And to affect praise of that wedespise , how ridiculous it is .
Comfortable doctrine , mistress ;
edify , edify . Methinks even thus it waswhen Dido and ^Eneas met in the cave ;
Tis such an obstinacy in you , sir , As never was conceited , to run on With an opinion against all the world , And what your eyes may witness ; to ad- venture The famishment for grief of such a woman As all men 's merits met in any one,Could not deserve .
I must confess it , Lycus , We 'll therefore now prevent it if we may , And that our curious trial hath not dweltToo long on this unnecessary haunt ;
Grief and all want of food , not having wrought Too mortally on her divine disposure , Lye . I fear they have , and she is past our cure .
I must confess with fear and shame as much .
And that she will not trust in any- thingWhat you persuade her to .
Then thou shalt haste And call my brother from his sec ;et shroud , Where he appointed thee to come and tell .
himHow all things have succeeded .
This is well ;
If , as I say , the ill be not so grown , That all help is denied her . But I fearThe matchless dame is famish 'd .

332
What ! is she well , sir ?
O no , she is famish 'd ;
She 's past our comfort , she lies drawingon .
The gods forbid !
Look thou , she 's drawing on .
How say 'st thou ?
Drawing on ? Illustrious witchcrafts !
Lies she not drawing on ?
She draws on fairly .
Our sister , sir ? this she ? can this be she ?
She , she , she , and none but she !
\He dances and sings .
She only queen of love and chastity .
chastity ! this women be .
' Slight , 'tis prodigious .
Horse , horse , horse , Four chariot-horses of the Thracian breed , Come , bring me , brother . O the happiest evening , That ever drew her veil before the sun , Who is't , canst tell ?
The soldier , sir , that watcht s The bodies crucified in this hallow 'd place , Of which to lose one , it is death to him , And yet the lustful knave is at his venery , While one might steal one .
What a slave was I , That held not out my wind 's strength con stantly , That she would prove thus ! O , incredible !
A poor eightpenny soldier ! She that lately Was at such height of interjection , Stoop now to such a base conjunction !
By heaven , I wonder now I see 't in act , My brain could ever dream of such athought .
And yet 'tis true . Rare , peerless , is't not , Lycus ?
I know not what it is , nor what to say .
O had I held out (villain that I was ) My blessed confidence but one minute longer , 1 should have been eternized . God 's my fortune , What an unspeakable sweet sight it is !
O eyes , I 'll sacrifice to your dear sense , And consecrate a fane to confidence .
But this you must at no hand tell your brother ;
Twill make him mad : for he that was before L So scourged but only with bare jealousy , What would he be if he should come to know it ?
He would be less mad ; for your only way To clear his jealousy , is to let him know it .
When knowledge comes , suspicion vanishes .
The sunbeams breaking forth , swallow the mists .
But as for you , sir gallant , howsoever Your banquet seems sweet in your liquorous palate , It shall be sure to turn gall in your maw .
Thy hand a little , Lycus , here without .
To what ?
No booty serve you , sir soldado , But my poor sister ? Come , lend me thy shoulder , I 'll climb the cross ; it will be such a cooler To my venerean gentleman 's hot liver , When he shall find one of his crucified bodies Stol 'n down , and he to be forthwith made fast In place thereof , for the sign OF the lost sentinel . Come , glorifyFirm confidence in great inconstancy .
And this believe ( for all proved knowledge swears ) He that believes in error , never errs .

' Tis late ; I must away .
Not yet , sweet love .
Tempt not my stay , 'tis dangerous .
The law is strict , and not to be dispensed with . If any sentinel be too late in 's watch , or that by his neglect one of the crucified bodies should be stolen from thecross , his life buys it .
A little stay will not endanger them .
The day 's proclaimer has not yet given warning , The cock yet has not beat his third alarm .
What ? Shall we ever dwell here amongst th ' antipodes ? Shall I not enjoy the honour of my fortune in public ? sit inLysander 's chair ? reign in his wealth ?
Thou shalt , thou shall ; though my love to thee Hath proved thus sudden , and for haste leapt over The complement of wooing , Yet only for the world 's opinion Lys . Mark that again .
333 Cy , I must maintain a form in partinghence .
Out upon't ! Opinion , the blind goddess of fools , foe to the virtuous , and only friend to undeserving persons , con temn it . Thou know 'st thou hast done virtuously , thou hast strangely sorrowed for thy husband , followed him to death , further thou could 'st not , thou hast buried thyself quick ( O that 'twere true ! ) , spent more tears over his carcase than would serve a whole city of saddest widows in a plaguetime , besides sighings and swoonings not to be credited .
True ; but those compliments mighthave their time , for fashion sake .
Right , opinion , and fashion . 'Sfoot , what call you time ? t 'hast wept these fourwhole days .
Nay , by 'rlady , almost five .
Look you there ; near upon fivewhole days .
Well , go and see ; return , we 'll gohome .
Hell be thy home ! Huge monsters damn ye , and your whole creation ! O ye gods , in the height of her mourning in a tomb , within sight of so many deaths , her husband 's believed body in her eye ! He dead , a few days before ! this mirror of nuptial chastity ; this votaress of widow- constancy , to change her faith , exchange kisses , embraces , with a stranger , and , but my shame withstood , to give the utmost earnest of her love to an eightpenny sentinel ! In effect , to prostitute herself on her husband 's coffin ! Lust , impiety , hell , womanhood itself , add , if you can ,one step to this !
One of the crucified bodies takendown !
Enough . {Slinks away .
And the sentinel not to be heardof ?
ist So! . No, sir .
Make out ! Haste , search about for him ! Does none of you know him ,nor his name ?
2nd So! . He 's but a stranger here , of some four days ' standing ; and we neverset eye on him , but at setting the watch .
For whom serves he ? You lookwell to your watch , masters .
Lst Sol . For Seigneur Stratio ; and whence he is , 'tis ignorant to us ; we are not correspondent for any but our ownplaces .
Y'are eloquent . Abroad , I say , let
He loves me not , I know , because of late I knew him but of mean condition ;
But now , by Fortune 's injudicious hand , Guided by bribing courtiers , he is raisedTo this high seat of honour .
Tomb opens , and Lysander within liesalong , Cynthia and Ero .
Pray thee disturb me not ; put out the lights .
Faith I 'll take a nap again .
Thou shalt not rest before I be re - solved What happy wind hath driven thee back to harbour ?
Was it my love ?
No.
Yet say so , sweet , that with the thought thereofI may enjoy all that I wish in earth .
I am sought for . A crucified body is stolen while I loitered here ; and I mustdie for't .
Die ? All the gods forbid ! O this affright torments me ten parts more thanthe sad loss of my dear husband .
Damnation ! I believe thee .
Yet hear a woman 's wit :Take counsel of necessity and it .
I have a body here which once I loved And honour 'd above all ; but that time 's past .
It is ; revenge it , heaven !
That shall supply at so extreme a need the vacant gibbet .
Canero . What ! thy husband 's body ?
What hurt is't , being dead , it savethe living ?


Vex not thyself , dear love , nor use delay ;
Tempt not this danger , set thy hands to work .
I cannot do 't ; my heart will not permit My hands to execute a second murther :The truth is I am he that slew thy husband .
The gods forbid !
It was this hand that bathed my reeking sword In his life blood , while he cried out for mercy , But I , remorseless , panch 'd him , cut his throat , He with his last breath crying , Cynthia .
O thou hast told me news that cleaves my heart .
Would I had never seen thee , or heard sooner This bloody story ; yet see , note my truth , Yet I must love thee .
Out upon the monster !
Go , tell the Governor ; let me be broughtTo die for that most famous villany ;
Not for this miching , base transgressionOf tenant negligence .
I cannot do 't .
" Love must salve any murther : I 'll be judge Of thee , dear love , and these shall be thy pains , Instead of iron , to suffer these soft chains .
O , I am infinitely obliged .
Arise , I say , thou saver of my life , Do not with vain-affrighting conscience Betray a life , that is not thine but mine :Rise and preserve it .
Ha ! thy husband 's body ?
Hang 't up , you say , instead of that that 's stolen , Yet I his murtherer , is that your meaning ?
It is , my love .
Thy love amazes me : The point is yet how we shall get it thither , Ha ! Tie a halter about 's neck , and draghim to the gallows : shall I , my love ?
So you may do indeed , Or if your own strength will not serve , we 'll aid Our hands to yours , and bear him to the place .
For heaven 's love come , the night goes off apace .
All the infernal plagues dwell in thy soul !
I 'll fetch a crow of iron to break the coffin .
Do , love ; be speedy .
As I wish thy damnation .

What is a woman ? what are the worst when the best are so past naming ? As men like this let them try their wives again . Put women to the test ; discover them ; paint them ten parts more than they do them - selves , rather than look on them as they are ; their wits are but painted that disliketheir painting .
Thou foolish thirster after idle secrets And ills abroad , look home , and store and choke thee ;
There sticks an Acheloiis ' horn of all , copie
As much as Alizon of streams receives , Or lofty Ida shows of shady leaves .
Who 's that ?
I wonder Lycus fails me . Nor can 1 hear what 's become of him . He would not certain ride to Dipolis to call mybrother back , without my knowledge .
My brother 's voice ; what makes he hereabouts so untimely ? I 'll slip him .

Who goes there ?
A friend .
Dear friend , let 's know you . A friend least looked for but most welcome , and with many a long look expected here , j What , sir , unbooted ! have you been longarrived ?
Not long , some two hours before \night .
Well , brother , y 'have the most j
ever suffered for the sin of a husband . I jcannot blame your confidence indeed now , !
'tis built on such infallible ground . Lycus , | I think , be gone to call you to the rescue of her life . Why she ! O incomprehensible !
I have heard all related since myarrival . We 'll meet to-morrow .
What haste , brother ! But was it related with what intolerable pains I and my mistress , her other friends , matrons
cult to decide whether the " Copie enough " bears reference to the Cornucopia , or is a tech - nical memorandum of the printer , inadvertently itransferred from the MS. into the text . ED.
335 and magistrates , laboured her diversionfrom that course ?
Yes , yes .
What streams of tears she poured out ; what tresses of her hair she tore ; and offered on your supposedhearse !
I have heard all .
But above all , how since that time her eyes never harboured wink of slumber these six days ; no , nor tastedthe least dram of any sustenance .
How is that assured ?
Not a scruple .
Are you sure there came no soldierto her nor brought her victuals ?
Soldier ? what soldier ?
Why , some soldier of the watch , that attends the executed bodies ; well , brother , I am in haste ; to-morrow shall supply this night 's defect of conference :adieu . \Exit Lysander .
A soldier ? of the watch ? bring her victuals ? Go to , brother , I have you in the wind ; he 's unharnessed of all his travelling accoutrements . I came directly from 's house , no word of him there ; heknows the whole relation ; he 's passionate .
All collections speak he was the soldier .
What should be the riddle of this ? that he is stolen hither into a soldier 's disguise ? he should have stayed at Dipolis to receive news from us . Whether he suspected our relation , or had not patience to expect it , or whether that furious , frantic , capricious devil , jealousy , hath tossed him hither on his horns , I cannot conjecture . But the case is clear , he 's the soldier . Sister , lookto your fame , your chastity 's uncovered .
Are they here still ? here , believe it , both ,most wofully weeping over the bottle .

Tharsalio : open .
Alas , sir , 'tis no boot to vex your sister and yourself ; she is desperate , and will not hear persuasion , she 's veryweak .
Here 's a true-bred chamber-maid .
Alas , I am sorry for't ; I have brought her meat and Candian wine to strengthenher .
Oh , the very naming an't will driveher into a swoon : good sir , forbear .
Yet open , sweet , that I may blessmine eyes with sight of her fair shrine ;
and he sees her head laid on the coffin ,
to wake you out of this sleeping mummery .
Alas ! she 's faint , and speech ispainful to her .
Well said , frubber . Was thereno soldier here lately ?
A soldier ? When ?
This night , last night , t 'other night ; and I know not how many nightsand days .
Who 's there ?
Your brother , mistress , that asks ifthere were not a soldier here .
Here was no soldier .
Yes , mistress ; I think here was such a one , though you took no heed ofhim .
Go to , sister ; did not you join kisses , embraces , and plight indeed the utmost pledge of nuptial love with him ? Deny 't , deny 't ; but first hear me a short story . The soldier was your disguised husband ! Dispute it not . That you see yonder is but a shadow ; an empty chest , containing nothing but air . Stand not to gaze at it , 'tis true . This was a project of his own contriving , to put your loyalty and constant vows to the test :y 'are warned , be armed . \Exit .
O fie , a these perils !
O Ero ! we are undone .
Nay , you 'd ne 'er be warned ; I ever wished you to withstand the push of that soldier 's pike , and not enter him too deep into your bosom , but to keep sacred your widow 's vows made to Lysander . , Cy . Thou didst , thou didst .
Now you may see th 'event . Well , our safety lies in our speed ; he 'll do usmischief if we prevent not his coming .
Let 's to your mother 's , and there call out your mightiest friends to guard you from his fury . Let them begin the quarrel with him for practising this villany on your sexto entrap your frailties .
Nay , I resolve to sit out one brunt more , to try to what aim he 'll enforce his project ; were he some other man , un- known to me , his violence might awe me,but knowing him as I do , I fear him not .
Do thou but second me , thy strength and mine shall master his best force , if he should prove outrageous . Despair , theysay , makes cowards turn courageous .
336
ist Sol . All pains are lost in hunting out this soldier ; his fear (adding wings to his heels ) out-goes us as far as the fresh harethe tired hounds . Who goes there ?
znd Sol . A friend !
ist Sol . O , your success and mine , touching this sentinel , tells , I suppose , one tale ; he 's far enough , I undertake , by thistime .
znd Sol . I blame him not ; the law 's severe ( though just , and cannot be dispensed ) .
ist Sol . Why should the laws of Paphos , with more rigour than other city laws , pursue offenders ? That not appeased with their lives ' forfeit , exact a justice of them after death ? And if a soldier in his watch , forsooth , lose one of the dead bodies , he must die for't . It seems the State needed no soldiers when that wasmade a law .
2nd Sol . So we may chide the fire for burning us , or say the bee 's not good because she stings . ' Tis not the body thelaw respects , but the soldier 's neglect ;
when the watch ( the guard and safety ofthe city ) is left abandoned to all hazards .
But let him go ; and tell me if your news sort with mine , for Lycus , apprehended ,they say , about Lysander 's murther .
ist Sol . ' Tis true ; he 's at the .captain 's
lodge under guard , and 'tis my charge , in the morning , to unclose the leaden coffin and discover the body . The captain will assay an old conclusion , often approved , that at the murtherer 's sight the blood revives again , and boils afresh ; and every wound has a condemning voice to cry outguilty 'gainst the murtherer .
2nd Sol . O world , if this be true ; his dearest friend , his bed companion , whom of all his friends he culled out for hisbosom !
ist Sol . Tush , man , in this topsyturvy world friendship and bosomkindness are but made covers for mischief , means to compass ill . Nearallied trust is but a bridge for treason . The presumptions cry loud against him , his answers sound dis jointed , crosslegged , tripping up one another . He names a town whither he brought Lysander , murthered by moun taineers ; that 's false , some of the dwellers have been here , and all disclaim it . Be sides , the wounds he bears in show , are such as shrews closely give their husbands , that never bleed , and find to be counterfeit .
2nd Sol . .O that jade falsehood , is ;
never sound of all , But halts of one leg still .
Truth pace is all upright , sound every- where , And like a die , sets ever on a square .
And how is Lycus his bearing in this con- \ dition ?
ist Sol . ' Faith ( as the manner of such ' desperate offenders is till it come to thepoint ) , careless and confident , laughing ;
at all that seem to pity him . But leave it to th 'event . Night , fellow-soldier , you 'll not meet me in the morning at the tomb , and lend me your hand to the unriggingof Lysander 's hearse ?
2nd Sol . I care not if I do , to viewheaven 's power in this unbottomed cellar .
Blood , though it sleep a time , yet never dies .
Lysander solus ^vith a crow of iron , and a halter which he lay* down , and puts 'on his disguise again .
Come , my borrow "d disguise , let me once more Be reconciled to thee , my trustiest friend ;
Thou that in truest shape hast let me see That which my truer self hath hid from me : Help me to take revenge on a disguise , Ten times more false and counterfeit than thou .
Thou , false in show , hast been most true to me ;
The seeming true hath proved more false than her .
Assist me to behold this act of lust , Note with a scene of strange impiety .
Her husband 's murther 'd corse ! O more than horror !
I 'll not believe untried ; if she but lift A hand to act it , by the fates her brains fly out , Since she has madded me , let her beware my horns .
For though by goring her , no hope be shownTo cure myself , yet I 'll not bleed alone .

The soldier ; open .

337 Which , with much fear of my discovery , I have at last procured .
Shall we about this work ? I fear the morn Will overtake 's ; my stay hath been pro long 'd With hunting obscure nooks for these em ployments , The night prepares away . Come , art resolved ?
Ay , you shall find me constant .
Ay , so I have , most prodigiously constant .
Here 's a rare halter to hug him with .
Better you and I join our handsand bear him thither , you take his head .
Ay , for that was always heavier than 's whole body besides .
You can tell best that loaded it .
I 'll be at the feet , I am able to bearagainst you , I warrant you .
Hast thou prepared weak nature to digest A sight so much distasteful ; hast sear 'd thy heart , It bleed not at the bloody spectacle ?
Hast arm 'd thy fearful eyes against th'af - front Of such a direful object ?
Thy murthered husband ghastly staring onthee ; his wounds gaping to affright thee ;
his body soiled with gore ? 'fore heaven myheart shrugs at it .
So does not mine : Love 's resolute ; and stands not to consult With petty terror ; but in full career Runs blindfold through an army of mis - doubts And interposing fears ; perhaps I 'll weep , Or so make a forced face and laugh again .
O most valiant love !
I was thinking with myself as I came , how if this Brake to light ; his body known ;
( As many notes might make it ) would it not fix Upon thy fame an unremoved brand Of shame and hate ; they that in former times Adored thy virtue , would they not abhorThy loathest memory ?
All this I know , but yet my love to thee Swallows all this , or whatsoever doubtsCan come against it .
Shame 's but a feather balanced with thy love .
Neither fear nor shame ? you are steel toth ' proof , But I shall iron you ; come -then , let 's to work .
Alas , poor corpse , how many martyrdomsMust thou endure ! mangled by me a .
villain , And now exposed to foul shame of the gibbet ?
' Fore piety there is somewhat in me strives Against the deed , my very arm relents To strike a stroke so inhuman , To wound a hallow 'd hearse ? suppose 'twere mine , Would not my ghost start up and fly upon thee ?
How now ?
\He catches at her throat .
Nay , then I 'll assay my strength ;
a soldier , and afraid of a dead man ! A soft-roed milk-sop ! Come , I 'll do 't myself .
And I look on ? give me the iron .
No, I 'll not lose the glory an't .
This hand Lys . Pray thee , sweet , let it not be said the savage act was thine ; deliver me theengine .
Content yourself , 'tis in a fitter hand .
Wilt thou first ? art not thou the most Cy . Ill-destined wife of a transformed monster , Who to assure himself of what he knew , Hath lost the shape of man .
Ha ! cross-capers ?
Poor soldier 's case ; do not we know you , sir ?
But I have given thee what thou earnest to seek .
Go , satyr , run affrighted with the noise Of that harsh-sounding horn thyself hast blown ;
Farewell ; I leave thee there my husband 's corpse , Make much of that . \Exit cum Ero .
What have I done ? Oh , let me lieand grieve , and speak no more .
Captain , Lycus with a guard of three orfour soldiers .
Bring him away ; you must have patience , sir : if you can say aught to quit you of those presumptions that lie heavy on you , you shall be heard . If not , 'tis not your braves , nor your affecting looks cancarry it . We must acquit our duties .
Y'are Captain ath ' watch , sir .
You take me right .
333
But you have been suborned by some closevillain to defame me .
' Twill not be so put off , friend Lycus , I could wish your soul as free from taint of this foul fact as mine from anysuch unworthy practice .
Conduct me to the Governor him - self ; to confront before him your shallowaccusations .
First , sir , I 'll bear you to Lysander 's tomb , to confront the murthered body , and see what evidence the wounds will yieldagainst you .
Y'are wise , Captain . But if the body should chance not to speak if the wounds should be tongue-tied , Captain where 's then your evidence , Captain ? will you not be laughed at for an officiousCaptain ?
Y'are gallant , sir .
Your captainship commands mysendee no further .
Well , sir , perhaps I may , if this conclusion take not ; we 'll try what opera - tion lies in torture , to pull confession fromyou .
Say you so , Captain ? but hark you , Captain , might it not concur with the quality of your office , ere this matter grow to the height of a more threateningdanger , to wink a little at a by-slip or so ?
How 's that ?
To send a man abroad underguard of one of your silliest shack-rags ;
that he may beat the knave , and run 's way ? I mean this on good terms , Captain ; I 'll be thankful .
I 'll think on't hereafter . Meantime I have other employment for you .
Your place is worthily replenished , Captain . My duty , sir ; hark , Captain , there 's a mutiny in your army ; I 'll goraise the Governor . \Exiturus .
No haste , sir ; he 'll soon be herewithout your summons .
Soldiers thrust up Lysander/hw thetomb .
ist Sol . Bring forth the knight ath'tomb ; have we met with you , sir ?
Pray thee , soldier , use thine officewith better temper .
znd Sol . Come , convey him to theLord Governor .
First afore the Captain , sir . Have the heavens nought else to do but to stand still , and turn all their malignant aspectsupon one man ?
2nd Sol . Captain , here 's the sentinel we sought for ; he 's some newpressedsoldier , for none of us know him .
Where found you him ?
ist Sol . My truant was miched , sir , intoa blind corner of the tomb .
Well said , guard him safe . But forthe corpse .
For the corpse , sir ? bare misprision ;
there 's no body , nothing . A mere blanda - tion , a deceptio visus . Unless this soldierfor hunger have eat up Lysander 's body .
Why , I could have told you this before , Captain ; the body was borne away piecemeal by devout ladies of Venus ' order , for the man died one of Venus ' martyrs . And yet I heard since 'twas seen whole ath ' other side the downs upon a colestaff betwixt two huntsmen , to feed their dogs withal . Which was a miracle,Captain .
Mischief in this act hath a deep bottom , and requires more time to sound it . But you , sir , it seems , are a soldier of the newest stamp . Know you what 'tis to forsake your stand ? There 's one of the bodies in your charge stolen away ; how answer you that ? See , here comes theGovernor .
Tharsalio , Argus , Clinias , before Eu- dora , Cynthia , Laodice , Sthenio,lanthe , Ero , &amp;c .
Stand aside there .
Room for a strange Governor ! The perfect draught of a most brainless , im - perious upstart . O desert ! where wert thou when this wooden dagger was gildedover with the title of Governor ?
Peace , masters ; hear my lord .
All wisdom be silent ; now speaksauthority .
I am come in person to dischargejustice .
Of his office .
The cause you shall know here - after ; and it is this . A villain , whose very sight I abhor ; where is he ? Let me seehim .
Is't Lycus you mean , my lord ?
Go too , sirrah , y 'are too malapert ; I have heard of your sentinel 's escape , lookto't .
My lord , this is the sentinel youspeak of .
339 Go . How now , sir ? What time a dayis't ?
I cannot show you precisely , an'tplease your honour .
What ? shall we have replications ,rejoinders ?
Such a creature fool is , when hebestrides the back of authority .
Sirrah , stand you forth ! It is supposed thou hast committed a most inconvenient murther upon the body ofLysander .
My good lord , I have not .
Peace , varlet , dost chop with me ?
I say it is imagined thou hast murthered Lysander . How it will be proved , I know not . Thou shalt therefore presently be had to execution ; as justice , in such cases , requireth . Soldiers , take him away . Bringforth the sentinel .
Your lordship will first let mydefence be heard .
Sirrah ! I 'll no fending nor proving .
For my part , I am satisfied it is so ; that 's enough for thee . I had ever a sympathy in my mind against him . Let him be hadaway .
A most excellent apprehension !
He 's able , ye see , to judge of a cause atfirst sight , and hear but two parties .
Here 's a second Solon .
Hear him , my lord ; presumptions oftentimes ( Though likely grounded ) reach not to the truth , And truth is oft abused by likelihood .
Let him be heard , my lord .
Madam , content yourself . I will do justice ; I will not hear him . Your late lord was my honourable predecessor , but your ladyship must pardon me : in mattersof justice I am blind .
That 's true .
I know no persons . If a Court favourite write to me in a case of justice , I will pocket his letter , and proceed . If a suitor in a case of justice thrusts a bribe into my hand , I will pocket his bribe , and proceed . Therefore , madam , set your heart at rest ; I am seated in the throne of justice , and I will do justice ; I will nothear him .
Not hear him , my lord ?
No, my lady : and moreover , putyou in mind in whose presence you stand ;
if you parrot to me long go to .
Nay , the Vice must snap his authority at all he meets , how shall 't elsebe known what part he plays ?
Your husband was a noble gentle - man , but , alas ! he came short : he was no statesman . He has left a foul citybehind him .
Ay , and I can tell you 'twill trouble his lordship and all his honourableassistants of scavengers to sweep it clean .
It 's full of vices , and great ones ,too .
And thou none of the meanest .
But I 'll turn all topsy-turvy , and set up a new discipline amongst you . I 'll cutoff all perished members .
That 's the surgeon 's office .
Cast out these rotten , stinking carcasses , for infecting the whole city .
Rotten they may be , but their wenches use to pepper them , and their surgeons to parboil them ; and that pre - serves them from stinking , an't please yourhonour .
Peace , sirrah , peace ; and yet 'tis well said , too . A good pregnant fellow , i 'faith ! But to proceed . I will spuedrunkenness out ath ' city .
Into th ' country .
Shifters shall cheat and starve , and no man shall do good but where there is no need . Braggarts shall live at the head , and the tumult that haunt taverns . Asses shall bear good qualities , and wise men shall use them . I will whip lechery out ath ' the city ; there shall be no more cuckolds . They that heretofore were arrant cornutos , shall now be honest shop - keepers , and justice shall take place . Iwill hunt jealousy out of my dominion .
Do 'ye hear , brother ?
It shall be the only note of love to the husband , to love the wife ; and none shall be more kindly welcome to him thanhe that cuckolds him .
Believe it a wholesome reformation .
I 'll have no more beggars . Fools shall have wealth , and the learned shall live by their wits . I 'll have no more bank routs . They that owe money shall pay it at their best leisure , and the rest shall make a virtue of imprisonment , and their wives shall help to pay their debts . I 'll have all young widows spaded for marry ing again . For the old and withered , they shall be confiscate to unthrifty gal lants and decayed knights ; if they be poor they shall be burnt to make soapashes , or given to Surgeon 's Hall to be stamped to salve for the French measles . To conclude , I will cart pride out ath ' town .
Z 2 340
Well said , a mine honour . A goodsignificant fellow , i 'faith ! What is he ?
he talks much ; does he follow yourladyship ?
No, an't please your honour , I gobefore her .
A good undertaking presence ; a well-promising forehead . Your gentlemanusher , madam ?
Yours , if you please , my lord .
Born i'th ' city ?
Ay , an't please your honour , butbegot i'th ' Court .
Tressel-legged ?
Ay , an't please your honour .
The better ; it bears a breadth , makes room a both sides . Might I notsee his pace ?
Yes , an't please your honour .

And for the matter of Lycus , madam , I must tell you you are shallow . There 's a state point in't , hark you : the Viceroy Bas given him , and we must uphold cor- respondence . He must walk . Say one man goes wrongfully out ath ' world , there are hundreds to one come wrongfully intoth '' world .
Your lordship will give me but aword in private .
Come , brother , we know you well .
What means this habit ? Why stayed you not at Dipolis , as you resolved , to take advertisement for us of your wife 's bearing ?
O brother , this jealous frenzy hasborne me headlong to ruin .
Go to , be comforted ; uncaseyourself and discharge your friend .
Is that Lysander , say you ? And is all his story true ?
By 'rlady , madam , this jealousy will cost him dear . He undertook the person of a soldier ; and , as . a soldier , must have jus - tice . Madam , his Altitude in this case cannot dispense . Lycus , this soldier hathacquitted you .
And that acquital I 'll for him re - quite ; the body lost , is by this timerestored to his place .
It is , my lord .
These are State points , in which your lordship 's time Has not yet train 'd your lordship ; please your lordshipTo grace a nuptial we have now in hand .

Your lordship there shall hear the ample story ;
And how the ass wrapt in a lion 's skin Fearfully roar 'd ; but his large ears ap - pear 'd And made him laugh 'd at , that before was fearU Go . I 'll go with you . For my part , Iam at a nonplus .

Sister , give me your hand .
So , brother , let your lips compound the strife , And think you have the only constant wife .
