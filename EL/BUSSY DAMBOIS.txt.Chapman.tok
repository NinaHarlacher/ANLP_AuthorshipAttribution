Their work is goodly : so men merely great In their affected gravity of voice , Sourness of countenance , manners ' cruelty , Authority , wealth , and all the spawn of fortune , Think they bear all the kingdom 's worth before them , Yet differ not from those colossic statues , Which , with heroic forms without o 'er- spread , Within are nought but mortar , flint , and lead .
Man is a torch borne in the wind ; a dream But of a shadow , summ 'd with all his substance : And as great seamen , using all their wealth And skills in Neptune 's deep invisible paths , In tall ships richly built and ribb 'd with brass , To put a girdle round about the world ;
141 His country 's sight , to waft and guide them in : So when we wander furthest through the waves Of glassy Glory , and the gulfs of State , Topt with all titles , spreading all our reaches , As if each private arm would sphere the earth , We must to Virtue for her guide resort , Or we shall shipwrack in our safest port .

Monsieur with two Pages .
There is no second place in numerous State That holds more than a cipher ; in a king All places are contain 'd . His word and looks Are like the flashes and the bolts of Jove ;
His deeds inimitable , like the sea That shuts still as it opes , and leaves no tracts Nor prints of precedent for poor men 's facts : There 's but a thread betwixt me and a crown , I would not wish it cut , unless by nature ;
Yet to prepare me for that possible fortune ,'Tis good to get resolved spirits about me .
I follow 'd D'Ambois to this green retreat , A man of spirit beyond the reach of fear , Who ( discontent with his neglected worth ) Neglects the light , and loves obscure abodes ;
But he is young and haughty , apt to take Fire at advancement , to bear state and flourish ;
In his rise therefore shall my bounties shine : None loathes the world so much , nor loves to scoff it , But gold and grace will make him surfeit of it .
What , D'Ambois ?
He , sir .
Turn 'd to earth , alive ?
Up , man ; the sun shines on thee .
Let it shine : I am no mote to play in't , as great men are .
Think 'st thou men great in state , motes in the sun ?
They say so that would have thee freeze in shades , That ( like the gross Sicilian Gourmandist ) Kmpty their noses in the cates they love , That none may eat but they . Do thou but l.rimr
Light to the banquet Fortune sets before thee , And thou wilt loathe lean darkness like thy death .
Who would believe thy mettle could let sloth Rust and consume it ? If Themistocles Had lived obscured thus in th'Athenian State , Xerxes had made both him and it his slaves .
If brave Camillus had lurk 'd so in Rome , He had not five times been Dictator there , Nor four times triumph 'd . If Epami- nondas ( Who lived twice twenty years obscured in Thebes ) Had lived so still , he had been still un- named , And paid his country nor himself their right : But putting forth his strength , he rescued both From imminent ruin ; and like burnish 'd steel , After long use he shined ; for as the light Not only serves to show , but render us Mutually profitable ; so our lives In acts exemplary , not only win Ourselves good names , but doth to others give Matter for virtuous deeds , by which we live .
What would you wish me ?
Leave the troubled streams , And live , as thriversdo , at the wdl-head .
At the well-head ? Alas , what should I do With that enchanted glass ? See devils there ?
Or , like a strumpet , learn to set my looks In an eternal brake , or practise juggling , To keep my face still fast , my heart still loose ;
Or bear ( like dame schoolmistresses their riddles ) Two tongues , and be good only for a shift ;
Flatter great lords , to put them still in mind Why they were made lords ; or please humorous ladies With a good carriage , tell them idle tales To make their physic work ; spend a man 's life In sights and visitations , that will make His eyes as hollow as his mistress ' heart : To do none good , but those that have no need ;
To gain being forward , though you break for haste 142
But believe backwards , make your period And creed 's last article , " I believe in God : " And ( hearing villanies preach 'd ) t 'unfold . their art Learn to commit them , 'tis a great man 's part .
Shall I learn this there ?
No, thou need 'st not learn , Thou hast the theory ; now go there and practise .
Ay , in a threadbare suit ; when men come there , They must have high naps , and go from thence bare : A man may drown the parts of ten rich men In one poor suit ; brave barks and outward gloss Attract Court loves , be in parts ne 'er so gross .
Thou shalt have gloss enough , and all things fit T' enchase in all show thy long-smother 'd spirit : Be ruled by me then . The rude Scythians Painted blind Fortune 's powerful hands with wings To show her gifts come swift and suddenly , Which , if her favourite be not swift to take , He loses them for ever . Then be wise :

It is to sow them Upon my spirit , and make them spring a crown Worth millions of the seed-crowns he will send : Like to disparking noble husbandmen , He 'll put his plough into me , plough me up .
But his unsweating thrift is policy , And learning-hating policy is ignorant To fit his seed-land soil ; a smooth plain ground Will never nourish any politic seed ;
I am for honest actions , not for great : If I may bring up a new fashion , And rise in Court for virtue , speed his plough : The King hath known me long as well as he , Yet could my fortune never fit the lengthOf both their understandings till this hour .
There is a deep nick in time 's restless wheel For each man 's good , when which nick comes , it strikes , As rhetoric , yet works not persuasion , But only is a mean to make it work : So no man riseth by his real merit , But when it cries clink in his raiser 's spirit .
Many will say , that cannot rise at all , Man 's first ho fall .
lour 's rise is first step to his I 'll venture that ; men that fall low must die, As well as men cast headlong from the sky .
Humour of princes ! Is this wretch endued With any merit worth a thousand crowns ?
Will my lord have me be so ill a steward Of his revenue , to dispose a sum So great with so small cause as shows in him ?
I must examine this . Is your name D'Ambois ?
Sir ?
Is your name D'Ambois ?
Who have we here ?
Serve you the Monsieur ?
How ?
Serve you the Monsieur ?
Sir , y 'are very hot . I do serve the Monsieur , But in such place as gives me the com- mand Of all his other servants . And because His grace 's pleasure is to give your good , His pass through my command , methinks you mightUse me with more good fashion .
Cry you mercy ;
Now you have open 'd my dull eyes , I see you , And would be glad to see the good you speak of ;
What might 1 call your name ?
Monsieur Maffe .
Monsieur Maffe ? Then , good Mon - sieur Maffe,Pray let me know you better .
Pray do so , That you may use me better ; for yourself , By your no better outside , I would judge you To be some poet ; have you given my lord Some pamphlet ?
Pamphlet ?
Pamphlet , sir , I say .
That is to pass your charge to my poor use, To your discretion ?
Though he did not , sir , I hope 'tis no bad office to ask reason How that his grace gives me in charge , goes from me ?
That 's very perfect , sir .
Why , very good , sir ;
I pray then give me leave ; if for no pam - phlet , May I not know what other merit in you , Makes his compunction willing to relieve you ?
No merit in the world , sir .
That is strange .
Y'are a poor soldier , are you ?
That I am , sir .
And have commanded ?
Ay , and gone without , sir .
I see the man ; a hundred crowns will make him Swagger and drink healths to his grace 's bounty , And swear he could not be more bountiful ;
So there 's nine hundred crowns saved .
Here , tall soldier , His grace hath sent you a whole hundred crowns .
A hundred , sir ? Nay , do his highness right ;
I know his hand is larger , and perhaps I may deserve more than my outside shows ;
I am a scholar , as I am a soldier , And I can poetise ; and ( being well en- couraged ) May sing his fame for giving ; yours for delivering ( Like a most faithful steward ) what he gives .
What shall your subject be ?
I care not much If to his bounteous grace I sing the praise Of fair great noses , and to your desertsThe reverend virtues of a faithful steward .
What qualities have you , sir , beside your chain And velvet jacket ? Can your worship dance ?
A merry fellow , 'faith ; it seems my lord Will have him for his jester ; and by 'rlady , Such men are now no fools , 'tis a knight 's place : If I ( to save my lord some crowns ) should urge him T'abate his bounty , I should not be heard ;
I would to heaven 1 were an errant ass , For then I should be sure to have the ears Of these great men , where now their jesters have them .
' Tis good to please him , yet I 'll take no notice Of his preferment , but in policy Will still be grave and serious , lest he think I fear his wooden dagger . Here , sir Ambo !
How , Ambo , sir ?
Ay , is not your name Ambo ?
You call 'd me lately D'Ambois ; has your worshipSo short a head ?
I cry thee mercy , D'Ambois .
A thousand crowns I bring you from my lord : If you be thrifty , and play the good husband , you may make This a good standing living : 'tis a bounty His highness might perhaps have bestow 'd better .
Go , y 'are a rascal ; hence , away , you rogue !
What mean you , sir ?
Hence ! prate no more !
Or , by thy villain 's blood , thou pratest thy last !
A barbarous groom grudge at his master 's bounty !
But since I know he would as much abhor His hind should argue what he gives his friend , Take that , sir , for your aptness to dispute .

Duchess of Guise , your grace is much enrich 'd In the attendance of that English virgin , That will initiate her prime of youth ( Disposed to Court conditions ) under hand Of your preferr 'd instructions and com- mand , Rather than any in the English Court , Whose ladies are not match 'd in Christen- dom For graceful and confirm 'd behaviours ;
More than the Court , where they are bred , is equall 'd .
I like not their Court form ; it is too I crestfall 'n j In all observance , making demigods 144 BUSSY D'AMBOTS.

No question she 's the rarest queen in Europe .
But what 's that to her immortality ?
Assure you , cousin Guise , so great a courtier , So full of majesty and royal parts , No queen in Christendom may vaunt herself .
Her Court approves it , that 's a Court indeed , Not mixt with clowneries used in common houses , But , as Courts should be , th ' abstracts of their kingdoms , In all the beauty , state , and worth they hold , So is hers , amply , and by her inform 'd .
The world is not contracted in a man With more proportion and expression , Than in her Court , her kingdom . Our French Court Ts a mere mirror of confusion to it : The king and subject , lord and every slave , Dance a continual hay ; our rooms of state Kept like our stables ; no place more observed Than a rude market-place : and though our custom Keep this assured deformity from our eyes ' Tis ne 'er the less essentially unsightly , Which they would soon see , would they change their form To this of ours , and then compare them both ;
Which we must not affect , because in kingdoms Where the king 's change doth breed the subject 's terror , Pure innovation is more gross than error .
No question we shall see them imitate ( Though afar off ) the fashions of our Courts , As they have ever aped us in attire .
Never were men so weary of their skins , And apt to leap out of themselves as they , Who , when they travel to bring forth rare men , Come home , deliver 'dof a fine French suit .
Their brains lie with their tailors , and get babies For their most complete issue ; he 's sole heir To all the moral virtues that first greets The light with a new fashion , which be- comes them Like apes , disfigured with the attires of men .
No question they much wrong their real worth In affectation of otitlandish scum ;
But they have faults , and we more ; they foolish proud | To jet in others plumes so haughtily ;
We proud , that they are proud of foolery , Holding our worths more complete for their vaunts .
Come , mine own sweetheart , I will enter thee : Sir , I have brought a gentleman to Court , And pray you would vouchsafe to do him grace .
D'Ambois , I think ?
That 's still my name , my lord , 1'hough I be something alter 'd in attire .
I like your alteration , and must tell you I have expected th'offer of your service ;
For we ( in fear to make mild virtue proud) Use not to seek her out in any man .
Nor doth she use to seek out any man : He that will win must woo her ; she 's not shameless .
I urged her modesty in him , my lord , And gave her those rites that he says she merits .
If you have woo 'd and won , then , brother , wear him .
Th'art mine , sweetheart . See , here 's the Guise 's Duchess, The Countess of Montsurreau , Beaupres .
Come , I 'll enseam thee ; ladies , y 'are too many To be in council ; I have here a friendThat I would gladly enter in your graces .
Save you , ladies .
If you enter him in our graces , my lord , methinks by his blunt behaviour heshould come out of himself .
Has he never been courtier , mylord ?
Never , my lady .
And why did the toy take himin th ' head now ?
' Tis leap-year , lady , and thereforevery good to enter a courtier .
Mark , Duchess of Guise , there is one is not bashful .
No, my lord , he is much guilty of the bold extremity .
The man 's a courtier at first sight .
I can sing pricksong , lady , at first sight ; and why not be a courtier assuddenly ?
Here 's a courtier rotten before he beripe .
Think me not impudent , lady ;
I am yet no courtier : I desire to be one , and would gladly take entrance , madam ,under your princely colours .
Soft sir , you must rise by degrees , first being the servant of some common lady , or knight 's wife , then a little higher to a lord 's wife ; next a little higher to a countess ; yet a little higher to a duchess ,and then turn the ladder .
Do you allow a man , then , four mistresses , when the greatest mistress isallowed but three servants ?
Where find you that statute , sir ?
Why be judged by the groomporters .
The groom-porters ?
Ay , madam ; must not they judgeof all gamings i' th ' Court ?
You talk like a gamester .
Sir , know you me ?
My lord ?
I know not you . Whom do youserve ?
Serve , my lord ?
Go to , companion , your courtship 'stoo saucy .
Saucy ! Companion ! Tis the Guise , but yet those terms might havebeen spared of the Guiserd . Companion !
He 's jealous , by this light . Are you blind of that side , duke ? I 'll to her again for that . Forth , princely mistress , for thehonour of courtship . Another riddle !
Cease your courtship , or by heaven I 'll cut your throat .
Cut my throat ? cut a whetstone .
Good Ace ins Ntevius , do as much with your tongue , as he did with a razor : cutmy throat !
What new-come gallant have wehere , that dares mate the Guise thus ?
'Sfoot , 'tis D'Ambois . The duke mistakes him , on my life , for some knightof the new edition .
Cut my throat ! I would the king feared thy cutting of his throat no morethan I fear thy cutting of mine .
I 'll do 't , by this hand .
That hand dares not do 't y 'ave cut too many throats already , Guise ; and robbed the realm of many thousand souls , more precious than thine own . Come ,madam , talk on . 'Sfoot , can you not talk ?
Talk on , I say ; more courtship , as youlove it .
Here 's some strange distemper .
Here 's a sudden transmigration with D'Ambois out of the knight 's wardinto the duchess ' bed .
See what a metamorphosis a bravesuit can work .
' Slight , step to the Guise and discover him .
By no means ; let the new suit work ,we 'll see the issue .
Leave your courting .
I will not . I say , mistress , and I will stand unto it , that if a woman may have three servants , a man may have threescore mistresses .
Sirrah , I 'll have you whipped out ofthe Court for this insolence .
Whipped ? Such another syllable out a th ' presence , if thou darest for thydukedom .
Remember , poltroon .
Pray thee , forbear .
Passion of death ! Were not the king here , he should strow the chamberlike a rush .
But leave courting his wife , then .
I will not . I 'll court her in despite of him . Not court her ! Come , madam , talk on , fear me nothing ; well may 'st thou drive thy master from the Court , but neverD'Ambois .
His great heart will not down , 'tis like the sea That partly by his own internal heat , Partly the stars ' daily and nightly motion , Their heat and light , and partly of the place , The divers frames ; but chiefly by the moon .
Bristled with surges , never will be won , ( No , not when th'hearts of all those powers are burst ) To make retreat into his settled home , Till he be crown 'd with his own quietfoam .
You have the mate . Another .
{Exit Guise , after him the King , Monsieur whispering .
Why , here 's the lion , scared with the throat of a dunghill cock ; a fellow that has newly shaked off his shackles ; nowdoes he crow for that victory .
Tis one of the best jigs that everwas acted .

j L'A . Out of doubt , some new denizen 'd lord , and thinks that suit newly drawn out | a th ' mercer 's books .
I have heard of a fellow , that by a , fixed imagination looking upon a bull- \ baiting , had a visible pair of horns grew out j of his forehead ; and I believe this gallant , overjoyed with the conceit of Monsieur 's j cast suit , imagines himself to be theI Monsieur .
And why not ? as well as the ass , stalking in the lion 's case , bear himself like a lion , braying all the huger beasts out ofthe forest ?
Peace , he looks this way .
Marry , let him look , sir ; what will you say now if the Guise be gone to fetch ablanket for him ?
Faith , ! believe it for his honour sake .
But , if D' Ambois carry it clean ?
True , when he curvets in the blanket .
Ay , marry , sir .
'Sfoot , see how he stares on 's .
Lord bless us , let 's away .
Now , sir , take your full view ; howdoes the object please ye ?
If you ask my opinion , sir , I think rr suit fits as well as if't had been madeyou .
So , sir , and was that the subject ofyour ridiculous jollity ?
What 's that to you , sir ?
Sir , I have observed all your fleerings ; and resolve yourselves ye shallgive a strict account for't .
Oh , miraculous jealousy ! do you think yourself such a singular subject for laughter that none can fall into the matterof our merriment but you ?
LA . This jealousy of yours , sir , confesses some close defect in yourself , that we neverdreamed of .
We held discourse of a perfumed ass , that being disguised with a lion 's case , imagined himself a lion : I hope thattouched not you .
So , sir ; your descants do marvel- lous well fit this ground ; we shall meet where your buffoonly laughters will cost yethe best blood in your bodies .
For life 's sake let 's be gone ; he 'llkill 's outright .
Go , at your pleasures , I 'll be your ghost to haunt you ; and ye sleep an't , hang me L'A . Go , go , sir ; court your mistress .
And be advised ; we shall have odds Jagainst you .
Tush ! valour stands not in number ; \ I 'll maintain it , that one man may beatthree boys .
Nay , you shall have no odds of him in number , sir ; he 's a gentleman as good as the proudest of you , and ye shall notwrong him .
Not , sir ?
Not , sir : though he be not so rich ,he 's a better man than the best of you ;
and I will not endure it .
Not you , sir ?
No, sir , nor I.
I should thank you for this kind - ness , if I thought these perfumed musk-cats ( being out of this privilege ) durst but oncemew at us .
Does your confident spirit doubtthat , sir ? Follow us and try .
Come , sir , we 'll lead you a dance .

This desperate quarrel sprung out of their envies To D'Ambois ' sudden bravery , and great spirit .
Neither is worth their envy .
Less than eitherWill make the gall of envy overflow ;
She feeds on outcast entrails like a kite ;
In which foul heap , if any ill lies hid , She sticks her beak into it , shakes it up , And hurls it all abroad , that all may view it .
147 Have power to find none there , she forges some : She makes that crooked ever which is straight ;
Calls valour giddiness , justice tyranny ;
A wise man may shun her , she not herself : Whithersoever she flies from her harms , She bears her foe still clasp 'd in her own arms ;
And therefore , cousin Guise , let us avoid her .
What Atlas or Olympus lifts his head So far past covert , that with air enough My words may be inform 'd , and from his height I may be seen , and heard through all the world ?
A tale so worthy , and so fraught with wonder Sticks in my jaws , and labours with event .
Comest thou from D'Ambois ?
From him , and the rest , His friends and enemies ; whose stern fight I saw , And heard their words before and in the fray .
Relate at large what thou hast seen ( " That and heard .
I saw fierce D'Ambois and his two brave friends Enter the field , and at their heels their foes ;
Which were the famous soldiers , Barrisor , L'Anou , and Pyrrhot , great in deeds of arms : All which arrived at the evenest piece of earth The field afforded , the three challengers Turn 'd head , drew all their rapiers , and stood rank 'd : When face to face the three defendants met them , Alike prepared , and resolute alike .
Like bonfires of contributory wood Every man 's look shew 'd , fed with cither 's spirit ;
As one had been a mirror to another , Like forms of life and death , each took from other ;
And so were life and death mix 'd at their heights , That you could see no fear of death , for life , Nor love of life , for death ; but in their brows Pyrrho 's opinion in great letters shone ;
That life and death in all respects are one .
Pass 'd there no sort of words at their encounter ?
As Hector , 'twixl the hosts of Greece and Troy , ( When Paris and the Spartan king should end The nine years ' war ) held up his brazen lance For signal that both hosts should cease from arms , And hear him speak : so Barrisor (advised ) Advanced his naked rapier 'twixt both sides , Ripp 'd up the quarrel , and compared six lives Then laid in balance with six idle words ;
Offer 'd remission and contrition too ;
Or else that he and D'Ambois might con- clude The others ' dangers . D'Ambois liked the last ;
But Barrisor 's friends ( being equally en- gaged In the main quarrel ) never would exposeHis life alone to that they all deserved .
And ( for the other offer of remission ) D'Ambois ( that like a laurel put in fire Sparkled and spit ) did much much more than scorn , his wrong should incense him so like chaff , To go so soon out ; and like lighted paper Approve his spirit at once both fire and ashes ;
So drew they lots and in them fates appointed That Barrisor should fight with fiery D'Ambois ;
Pyrrhot with Melynell ; with Brisac L'Anou : And then like flame and powder they com- mixt , So spritely , that I wish 'd they had been spirits , That the ne 'er-shutting wounds , they needs must open , Might as they open 'd , shut and never kill : But D'Ambois ' sword ( that lighten 'd as it flew ) Shot like a pointed comet at the face Of manly Barrisor ; and there it stuck : Thrice pluck 'd he at it , and thrice drew on thrusts , From him that of himself was free as fire ;
Who thrust still as he pluck 'd , yet ( past belief ) He with his subtle eye , hand , body , scaped At last the deadly bitten point tugg 'd oft , On fell his yet undaunted foe so fiercely 148
But soon return 'd , redoubled in his danger , And at the heart of Barrisor seal 'd his anger : Then , as in Arden I have seen an oak Long shook with tempests , and his lofty top Bent to his root , which being at length made loose ( Even groaning with his weight ) he 'gan to nod This way and that : as loth his curled brows ( Which he had oft wrapt in the sky with storms ) Should stoop : and yet , his radical fibres burst , Stormlike he fell , and hid the fearcoldearth ;
So fell stout Barrisor , that had stood the shocks Of ten set battles in your highness " war , ' Gainst the sole soldier of the world , Navarre .
Oh , piteous and horrid murther !
Such a life Methinks had metal in it to survive , An age of men .
Such often soonest end : Thy felt report calls on , we long to knowOn what events the other have arrived .
Sorrow and fury , like two opposite fumes , Met in the upper region of a cloud , At the report made by this worthy 's fall , Brake from the earth , and with them rose Revenge , Entering with fresh powers his two noble friends ;
And under that odds fell surcharged Brisac , The friend of D'Ambois , before fierce L'Anou ;
Which D'Ambois seeing , as I once did see In my young travels through Armenia , An angry unicorn in his full career Charge with too swift a foot a jeweller That watch 'd him for the treasure of his brow , And ere he could get shelter of a tree , Nail him with his rich antler to the earth : So D'Ambois ran upon revenged L'Anou , Who eyeing th ' eager point borne in his face , And giving back , fell back , and in his fallHis foe 's uncurbed sword stopt in his heart ;
By which time all the life-strings of the tw'other Were cut , and both fell as their spirits flew Upwards ; and still hunt honour at the view : And now , of all the six , sole D'Ambois stood Untouch 'd , save only with the others ' blood .
All slain outright but he ?
All slain outright but he , Who kneeling in the warm life of his friends , ( All freckled with the blood his rapier rain 'd ) He kiss 'd their pale cheeks , and bade botli farewell ;
And see the bravest man the French earth bears .
Now is the time , y 'are princely vow d , my friend , Perform it princely , and obtain my pardon .
Else heaven forgive not me ; come on , brave friend .
If ever nature held herself her own , When the great trial of a king and sub - ject Met in one blood , both from one belly springing ;
Now prove her virtue and her greatness one , Or make the one the greater with the other , ( As true kings should ) and for your brother 's love , ( Which is a special species of true virtue ) Do that you could not do , not being a king .
Brother , I know your suit ; these wilful murthersAre ever past our pardon .
Manly slaughter Should never bear th'account of wilful murther ;
It being a spice of justice , where with life Offending past law , equal life is laid In equal balance , to scourge that offence By law of reputation , which to men Exceeds all positive law , and what that leaves To true men 's valours ( not prefixing rights Of satisfaction , suited to their wrongs ) A free man 's eminence may supply and take .
149 Lay on this violence , and all vaunt them - selves Law-menders and suppliers , though merebutchers ;
Should this fact ( though of justice ) be forgiven ?
Oh , no , my lord ; it would make cowards fear To touch the reputations of true men When only they are left to imp the law .
Justice will soon distinguish murtherous minds From just revengers : had my friend been slain , ( His enemy surviving ) he should die , Since he had added ^to a murther 'd fame ( Which was in his intent ) a murther 'dman ;
And this had worthily been wilful murther ;
But my friend only saved his fame 's dear life , Which is above life , taking th'under value , W r hich in the wrong it did , was forfeit tohim ;
And in this fact only preserves a man In his uprightness ; worthy to survive Millions of such as murther men alive .
Well , brother , rise , and raise your friend withal From death to life ; and D'Ambois , let your life ( Refined by passing through this merited death ) Be purged from more such foul pollution ;
Nor on your 'scape , nor valour more pre - suming To be again so daring .
My lord , I loathe as much a deed of unjust death As law itself doth ; and to tyrannize , Because I have a little spirit to dare And power to do , as to be tyrannized ;
This is a grace that ( on my knees re - doubled ) , I crave to double this , my short life 's gift ;
And shall your royal bounty centuple , That I may so make good what God and nature Have given me for my good ; since I am free , ( Offending no just law ) , let no law make By any wrong it does , my life her slave : When I am wrong 'd , and that law fails to right me , I ,et me be king myself ( as man was made ) , And do a justice that exceeds the law ;
If my wrong pass the power of single valour To right and expiate ; then be you my king , And do aright , exceeding law and nature : Who to himself is law , no law doth need ,Offends no law , and is a king indeed .
Enjoy what thou entreat 'st ; we give but ours .
Now vanish horrors into Court at- tractions , For which let this balm make thee fresh and fair .
How shall I quite your love ?
Be true to the end ;
I have obtain 'd a kingdom with my friend .
To whom my love hath long been vow 'd in heart , Although in hand for shew I held the duchess .
Montsurry , Tamyra , Beaupre , Pcro, Charlotte , Pyrha .
He will have pardon , sure .
' Twere pity , else : For though his great spirit something over- flow , All faults are still borne , that from greatness grow ;
But such a sudden courtier saw I never .
He was too sudden , which indeed was rudeness .
True , for it argued his no due con- ceit Both of the place and greatness of the persons , Nor of our sex : all which ( we all being strangers To his encounter ) should have made more mannersDeserve more welcome .
All this fault is foundBecause he loved the duchess and left you .
Alas , love give her joy ; I am so far From envy of her honour , that I swear , Had he encounter ' d me with such proud slight , I would have put that project face of hisTo a more test than did her duchesship .
Why ( by your leave , my lord ) I 'll speak it here , Although she be my aunt , she scarce was modest , When she perceived the duke her husband take Those late exceptions to her servant 's courtship, To entertain him .
Ay , and stand him still , Letting her husband give her servant place ;
Though he did manly , she should be a woman .
D'Ambois is pardo n 'd ; where 's a king ? where law ?
See how it runs , much like a turbulent sea ;
Here high , and glorious as it did contend To wash the heavens and make the stars more pure ;
And here so low , it leaves the mud of hell To every common view ; come , Count Montsurry , We must consult of this .
Stay not , sweet lord .
Be pleased , I 'll straight return .
{Exit cum Guise .
Would that would please me !
I 'll leave you , madam , to your passions ;
I cannot cloak it ; but , as when a fume , Hot , dry , and gross , within the womb of earth Or in her superficies begot , When extreme cold hath struck it to her heart , The more it is compress 'd , the more it rageth ;
Exceeds his prison 's strength that should contain it , And then it tosseth temples in the air , All bars made engines to his insolent fury So , of a sudden , my licentious fancy Riots within me ; not my name and house Nor my religion , to this hour observed , Can stand above it ; I must utter that That will in parting break more strings in me Than death when life parts ; and that holy That , from my cradle , counsell 'd for my soul ,now must make an agent for my blood .
Yet , is my mistress gracious ?
Yet unanswer 'd ?
Pray thee regard thine own good , if not mine , And cheer my love for that ; you do not know What you may be by me , nor what without me ;
I may have power t 'advance and pull down any .
That 's not my study ; one way I am sure You shall not pull down me ; my hus- band 's height Is crown to all my hopes ; and his retiringTo any mean state , shall be . my aspiring ;
Mine honour 's in mine own hands , spite of kings .
Honour , what 's that : your second maidenhead : And what is that ? a word : the word is gone , The thing remains : the rose is pluck 'd , the stalk Abides ; an easy loss where no lack 's found : Believe it , there 's as small lack in the loss As there is pain i'th " losing ; archers ever Have two strings to a bow ; and shall great Cupid ( Archer of archers both in men and women , )Be worse provided than a common archer ?
A husband and a friend all wise wives have .
Wise wives they are that on such strings depend , With a firm husband joining a loose friend .
Still you stand on your husband , so do all The common sex of you , when y 'are encounter 'd With one ye cannot fancy : all men know You live in Court , here , by your own election , Frequenting all our solemn sports and triumphs , All the most youthful company of men : And wherefore do you this ? To please your husband ?
' Tis gross and fulsome : if your husband 's pleasure Be all your object , and you aim at honourIn living close to him , get you from Court ;
You may have him at home ; these common putoffsFor common women serve : my honour ?
husband ?
Dames maritorious ne 'er were meritorious : Speak plain , and say " I do not like you , sir , Y'are an ill-favour 'd fellow in my eye ; "
And I am answer 'd .
Then , I pray , be answer 'd : For in good faith , my lord , I do not like youIn that sort you like .
Then have at you , here : Take ( with a politic hand ) this rope of pearl , And though you be not amorous , yet be wise : Take me for wisdom ; he that you can loveIs ne 'er the further from you .
Now it comes So ill prepared , that I may take a poison , Under a medicine as good cheap as it ;
I will not have it were it worth the world .
Horror of death ; could I but please your eye , You would give me the like , ere you would lose me :Honour and husband !
By this light , my lord , Y'are a vile fellow , and I 'll tell the king Your occupation of dishonouring ladies And of his Court : a lady cannot live As she was born , and with that sort of ) pleasure That fits her state , but she must be de- j famed With an infamous lord 's detraction .
Who would endure the Court if these attempts Of open and profess 'd lust must be borne ?
Who 's there ? Come on , dame , you are at your book When men are at your mistress ; have I taught you Any such waiting-woman 's quality ?
Farewell , good husband .

Was not the Monsieur here ?
Yes , to good purpose ;
And your cause is as good to seek him too , And haunt his company .
Why , what 's 'the matter ?
Matter of death , were I some husbands ' wife : I cannot live at quiet in my chamber For opportunities almost to rapesOffer 'd me by him .
Pray thee bear with him ;
Thou know 'st he is a bachelor and a courtier , Ay , and a prince ; and their prerogatives Are , to their laws , as to their pardons are Their reservations , after Parliaments One quits another : form gives all their essence : That prince doth high in virtue 's reckoning stand That will entreat a vice , and not command .
So far bear with him ; should another man Trust to his privilege , he should trust to death : Take comfort , then , my comfort , nay , triumph And crown thyself , thou part 'st with victory ;
My presence is so only dear to thee That other men 's appear worse than they be .
For this night yet , bear with my forced absence ;
Thou know 'st my business ; and with how much weightMy vow hath charged it .
True , my lord , and never My fruitless love shall let your serious -honour ;
Yet , sweet lord , do not stay ; you know my soul Is so long time without me , and I deadAs you are absent .
By this kiss , receiveMy soul for hostage , till I see my love .
The morn shall let me see you .
With the sun I 'll visit thy more comfortable beauties .
This is my comfort , that the sun hath left The whole world 's beauty ere my sun leaves me .
Farewell , my light and life ; but not in him , In mine own dark love and light bent to another . .
Alas ! that in the wane of our affections We should supply it with a full dissem - bling , In which each youngest maid is grown a mother , Frailty is fruitful , one sin gets another : Our loves like sparkles are that brightest shine 152
Go , maid , to bed ; lend me your book , I pray : Not like yourself for form ; I 'll this night trouble None of your services : make sure the doors , And call your other fellows to their rest .
Now all ye peaceful regents of the night , Silently-gliding exhalations , Languishing winds , and murmuring falls of waters , Sadness of heart and ominous secureness , Enchantments , dead sleeps , all the friends of rest , That ever wrought upon the life of man , Extend your utmost strengths ; and this charm 'd hour Fix like the Centre ; make the violent wheels Of Time and Fortune stand ; and great Existence ( The Maker 's treasure ) now not seem to be, To all but my approaching friends and me .
They come , alas ! they come ; fear , fear and hope Of one thing , at one instant fight in me : I love what most I loathe , and cannot live Unless I compass that which holds my death : For love is hateful without love again , And he I love , will loathe me , when he sees I fly my sex , my virtue , my renown, To run so madly on a man unknown .

How shall I look on him ? how shall I live , And not consume in blushes ? I will in, And cast myself off , as I ne 'er had been .

Come , worthiest son , I am past measure glad , That you ( whose worth I have approved so long ) Should be the object of her fearful love ;
Since both your wit and spirit can adapt Their full force to supply her utmost weak ness : ! You know her worths and virtues , for report Of all that know , is to a man a knowledge : You know besides , that our affections ' storm , Raised in our blood , no reason can reform .
Though she seek then their satisfaction ( Which she must needs , or rest unsatisfied ) Your judgment will esteem her peace thus wrought , Nothing less dear than if yourself had sought : And ( with another colour , which my art Shall teach you to lay on ) yourself must seem The only agent , and the first orb moveIn this our set and cunning world of love .
Give me the colour , my most honour 'd father , And trust my cunning then to lay it on .
' Tis this , good son ; Lord Barrisor ( whom you slew ) Did love her dearly , and with all fit means Hath urged his acceptation , of all which She keeps one letter written in his blood : You must say thus then , that you heard from me How much herself was touch 'd in con- science With a report ( which is in truth dispersed ) That your main quarrel grew about her love , Lord Barrisor imagining your courtship Of the great Guise 's Duchess in the presence , Was by you made to his elected mistress : And so made me your mean now to resolve her , Choosing ( by my direction ) this night 's depth For the more clear avoiding of all note , Of your presumed presence , and with this ( To clear her hands of such a lover 's blood ) She will so kindly thank and entertain you , ( Methinks I see how ) , ay , and ten to one , Show you the confirmation in his blood , Lest you should think report and she did feign , That you shall so have circumstantial means To come to the direct , which must be used ;
For the direct is crooked ; love comes flying ;
The height of love is still won with denying .
Thanks , honour 'd father .
She must never know That you know anything of any love Sustain 'd on her part : For learn this of me ;
BUSSY D' AM BO IS.
153 If she dissemble , she thinks 'tis not done ;
If not dissemble , nor a little chide, Give her her wish , she is not satisfied ;
To have a man think that she never seeks , Does her more good than to have all she likes : This frailty sticks in them beyond their sex , Which to reform , reason is too perplex :Urge reason to them , it will do no good ;
Humour ( that is the chariot of our food In everybody ) must in them be fed , To carry their affections by it bred .
Stand close .
Alas , I fear my strangeness will retire him .
If he go back , I die ; I must prevent it , And cheer his onset with my sight at least , And that 's the most ; though every step he takes Goes to my heart , I 'll rather die than seemNot to be strange to that I most esteem .
Madam .
Ah !
You will pardon me , I hope , That so beyond your expectation , And at a time for visitants so unfit , I ( with my noble friend here ) visit you : You know that my access at any time Hath ever been admitted ; and that friend That my care will presume to bring with me Shall have all circumstance of worth in himTo merit as free welaome as myself .
Oh , father ! but at this suspicious hour You know how apt best men are to suspect us , In any cause , that makes suspicion 's shadow No greater than the shadow of a hair : And y 'are to blame ; what though my lord and husband Lie forth to-night ? and since I cannot sleep When he is absent , I sit up to-night , Though all the doors are sure , and all our servants As sure bound with their sleeps ; yet there is One That wakes above , whose eye no sleep can bind ;
He sees through doors , and darkness , and our thoughts ;
And therefore as we should avoid with fear , To think amiss ourselves before his search ;
So should we be as curious to shunAll cause that other think not ill of us .
Madam , 'tis far from that ; I only heard By this my honour 'd father , that jour conscience Made some deep scruple with a false re - portThat Barrisor 's blood should something .
touch your honour ;
Since he imagined I was courting you , When I was bold to change words witli .
the duchess , And therefore made his quarrel ; his long love And service , as I hear , being deeply vow 'd .
To your perfections , which my ready pre - sence , Presumed on with my father at this season For the more care of your so curious honour , Can well resolve your conscience , is most false .
And is it therefore that you come , good sir ?
Then crave I now your pardon and my father 's , And swear your presence does me so much good , That all I have it binds to your requital ;
Indeed , sir , 'tis most true that a report Is spread , alleging that his love to me Was reason of your quarrel , and because You shall not think I feign it for my glory That he importuned me for his court service , I 'll show you his own hand , set down in blood To that vain purpose : good sir , then come in .
Father , I thank you now a thousand-fold .
\Exit Tamyra and D'Ambois .
May it be worth it to you , honour 'd daughter . \_Desceudit Friar .
Sweet mistress , cease , your con- science is too nice , And bites too hotly of the Puritan spice .
Oh my dear servant , in thy close embraces , I have set open all the doors of danger To my encompass 'd honour , and my life : 154
But now am subject to the heartless fear Of every shadow , and of every breath , And would change firmness with an aspen leaf : So confident a spotless conscience is , So weak a guilty : oh , the dangerous siege Sin lays about us ! and the tyranny He exercises when he hath expugn 'd : Like to the horror of a winter 's thunder , Mix 'd with a gushing storm , that suffer nothing To stir abroad on earth but their own rages , Is sin , when it hath gather 'd head above us : No roof , no shelter can secure us so , But he will drown our cheeks in fear or woe .
Sin is a coward , madam , and in- sults But on our weakness , in his truest valour : And so our ignorance tames us , that we let His shadows fright us : and like empty clouds , In which our faulty apprehensions forge The forms of dragons , lions , elephants , When they hold no proportion , the sly charms Of the witch policy makes him , like a mon- ster Kept only to show men for servile money That false hag often paints him in her cloth Ten times more monstrous than he is in troth : In three of us , the secret of our meeting Is only guarded , and three friends as one Have ever been esteem 'd : as our three powers That in our one soul are as one united : Why should we fear then ? For myself I swear Sooner shall torture be the sire to pleasure And health be grievous to one long time sick , Than the dear jewel of your fame in meBe made an outcast to your infamy ;
Nor shall my valour ( sacred to your virtues Only give free course to it , from myself : But make it fly out of the mouths of kingsIn golden vapours and with awful wings .
It rests as all kings ' seals were se in thee .
Now let us call my father , whom I swear I could extremely chide , but that I fear To make him so suspicious of my love Of which , sweet servant , do not let bin know For all the world .
Alas ! he will not think it .
Come , then ho ! Father , ope , and take your friend . \Ascendit Friar .
Now , honour 'd daughter , is your doubt resolved ?
Ay , father , but you went away too soon .
Too soon ?
Indeed you did , you should have stay 'd ;
Had not your worthy friend been of your bringing , And that contains all laws to temper me , ^ot all the fearful danger that besieged us , Had awed my throat from exclamation .
I know your serious disposition well .
Come , son , the morn comes on .
Now , honour 'd mistress,Till farther service call , all bliss supply you .
And you this chain of pearl , andmy love only .

What shall weak dames do , when the whole work of nature Hath a strong finger in each one of us ?
Needs must that sweep away the silly cob web Of our stillundone labours ; that lays still Our powers to it : as to the line , the stone , Not to the stone , the line should be opposed ;
We cannot keep our constant course in virtue : What is alike at all parts ? Every dayDiffers from other : every hour and minute ;
Ay , every thought in our false clock of life , Ofttimes inverts the whole circumference : We must be sometimes one , sometimes an- other : Our bodies are but thick clouds to our souls , Through which they cannot shine when they desire : When all the stars , and even the sun him - self , Must stay the vapours ' fumes that he ex - hales Before he can make good his beams to us ;
O , how can we , that are but motes to him , Wandering at random in his order 'd rays , Disperse our passions ' fumes , with our weak labours , That are more thick and black than allearth 's vapours ?
155 Enter Montsurry .
Good day . my love ; what , up and ready too !
Both , my dear lord ; not all this night made I Myself unready , or could sleep a wink .
Alas ! what troubled my true love ?
my peace , From being at peace within her better self ?
Or how could sleep forbear to seize thine eyes When he might challenge them as his just prize ?
I am in no power earthly , but in yours ;
To what end should I go to bed , my lord , That wholly miss 'd the comfort of my bed ?
Or how should sleep possess my faculties , Wanting the proper closer of mine eyes ?
Then will I never more sleep night from thee ;
All mine own business , all the king 's affairs , Shall take the day to serve them ; every night I 'll ever dedicate to thy delight .
Nay , good my lord , esteem not my 'desires Such deters on their humours that my judgment Cannot subdue them to your worthier pleasure ;
A wife 's pleased husband must her object be In all her acts , not her soothed fantasy .
Then come , my love , now pay those rites to sleep Thy fair eyes owe him ; shall we now to bed ?
Oh , no , my lord ; your holy friar says All couplings in the day that touch the bed Adulterous are , even in the married ;
Whose grave and worthy doctrine , well I know , Your faith in him will liberally allow .
He 's a most learned and religious man ;
Come to the presence then , and see great D'Ambois ( Fortune 's proud mushroom sh'ot up in a night ) Stand like an Atlas under our King 's arm ;
Which greatness with him Monsieur now enviesAs bitterly and deadly as the Guise .
What , he that was but yesterday his maker , His raiser and preserver ?
Even the same : Each natural agent works but to this end , To render that it works on like itself ;
Which since the Monsieur in his act on D'Ambois 'annot to his ambitious end effect , But that , quite opposite , the King hath power , In his love borne to D'Ambois , to convert The point of Monsieur 's aim on his own breast , He turns his outward love to inward hate .
A prince 's love is like the lightning 's fume , Which no man can embrace but must consume . ^Exeunt .
Henry , D'Ambois , Monsieur , Guise , Duchess , Annabelle , Charlotte , Attendants .
Speak home , my Bussy ; thy im - partial words Are like brave falcons that dare truss a fowl Much greater than themselves ; flatterers are kites That check at sparrows ; thou shalt be my eagle , And bear my thunder underneath thy wings ;
Truth 's words , like jewels , hang in the ears of kings .
Would I might live to see no Jews hang there Instead of jewels ; sycophants , I mean , Who use truth like the devil , his true foe , Cast by the angel to the pit of fears , And bound in chains ; truth seldom decks kings ' ears .
Slave flattery ( like a rippier 's legs roll 'd upIn boots of hay-ropes ) with kings ' s.cthed
guts Swaddled and strappled , now lives only free .
O , 'tis a subtle knave ; how like the plague Unfelt he strikes into the brain of truth , And rageth in his entrails , when he can , Worse than the poison of a red-hair 'd man .
Fly at him and his brood ; I cast thee off , And once more give thee surname ol mine eagle .
I 'll make you sport enough , then ;
let me have My lucerns too , or dogs inured to hunt Beasts of most rapine , but to put them up ,
Show me a great man ( by the people 's voice , Which is the voice of God ) that by his greatness Bombasts his private roofs with public riches ;
That affects royalty , rising from a clapdish ;
That rules so much more by his suffering king , That he makes kings of his subordinate slaves : Himself and them graduate like wood - mongers , Piling a stack of billets , from the earth,Raising each other into steeples ' heights ;
Let him convey this on the turning props Of Protean law , and , his own counsel keeping , Keep all upright ; let me but hawk at him , I 'll play the vulture , and so thump his liver , That , like a huge unlading Argosy , He shall confess all , and you then may hang him .
Show me a clergyman , that is in voiceA lark of heaven , in heart a mole of earth ;
That hath good living , and a wicked life ;
A temperate look , and a luxurious gut ;
Turning the rents of his superfluous curesInto your pheasants and your partridges ;
Venting their quintessence as men read Hebrew ;
Let me but hawk at him , and , like the other , He shall confess all , and you then may hang him .
Show me a lawyer that turns sacred law ( The equal Tenderer of each man his own , The scourge of rapine and extortion , The sanctuary and impregnable defence Of retired learning and besieged virtue ) Into a harpy , that eats all but 's own , Into the damned sins it punisheth ;
Into the synagogue of thieves and atheists ,Blood into gold , and justice into lust ;
Let me but hawk at him , as at the rest , He shall confess all , and you then may hang him .
Where will you find such game as you would hawk at ?
I 'll hawk about your house for one of them .
Come , y 'are a glorious ruffian , and run proud Of the King 's headlong graces ; hold your breath , Or , by that poison 'd vapour , not the King Shall back your murtherous valour againstme .
I would the King would make his presence free But for one bout betwixt us : by the reverence Due to the sacred space 'twixt kings and subjects , Here would I make thee cast that popular purple , In which thy proud soul sits and braves thy sovereign .
Peace , peace , I pray thee peace .
Let him peace first that made the first war .
He 's the better man .
And therefore may do worst ?
He has more titles .
So Hydra had more heads .
He 's greater known .
His greatness is the people 's ; mine 's mine own .
He 's nobly born .
He is not , I am noble .
And noblesse in his blood hath no gradation , But in his merit .
Th'art not nobly born , But bastard to the Cardinal of Ambois .
Thou liest , proud Guiserd ; let me fly , my lord .
Not in my face , my eagle ; violence flies The sanctuaries of a prince 's eyes .
Still shall we chide and foam upon this bit ?
Is the Guise only great in faction ?
Stands he not by himself ? Proves he th ' opinion That men 's souls are without them ? Be a duke , And lead me to the field .
Come , follow me .
Stay them , stay , D'Ambois ; cousin Guise , I wonder Your equal disposition brooks so ill A man so good , that only would uphold Man in his native noblesse , from whose fall All our dimensions rise ; that in himself ( Without the outward patches of our frailty , Riches and honour ) knows he comprehends Worth with the greatest ; kings had never borne Such boundless empire over other men , Had all maintain 'd the spirit and state of D'Ambois ;
BUSSY D' AM BO IS.
'57 Had all preserved her in her prime , like D'Ambois ;
No envy , no disjunction had dissolved , Or pluck 'd one stick out of the golden faggot In which the world of Saturn bound our lives , Had all been held together with the nerves , The genius , and th ' ingenuous soul of D'Ambois .
Let my hand therefore be the Hermean rod To part and reconcile , and so conserve you , As my combined embracers and supporters .
Bit , ' Tis our king 's motion , and \ve shall not seem To worst eyes womanish , change thus soon though we Never so great grudgi for his greater pleasure .
I seal to that , and so the manly freedom That you so much profess , hereafter prove not A bold and glorious licence to deprave , To me his hand shall hold the Hermean virtue His grace affects , in which submissive signOn this his sacred right hand , I lay mine .
' Tis well , my lord , and 'so your worthy greatness Decline not to the greater insolence , Nor make you think it a prerogative , To rack men 's freedoms with the ruder wrongs ;
My hand ( stuck full of laurel , in true sign ' Tis wholly dedicate to righteous peace) In all submission kisseth th ' other side .
He , Thanks to ye both ; and kindly I in- vite ye Both to a banquet , where we 'll sacrificeFull cups to confirmation of your loves ;
At which , fair ladies , I entreat your presence ;
And hope you , madam , will take one ca rouse For reconcilement of your lord and servant .
If I should fail , my lord , some other lady Would be found there to do that for my servant .
Any of these here ?
Nay , I know not that .
Think your thoughts like my mistress' , honour 'd lady ?
I think not on you , sir ; y 'are one J know not .
Cry you mercy , madam .
Oh , sir , has she met you ?

Y'ave stuck us up a very worthy flag , That takes more wind than we with all our sails .
Oh , so he spreads and flourishes .
He must down , Upstarts should never perch too near a crow n .
' Tis true , my lord ; and as this doting hand , Even out of earth , like Juno , struck this giant , So Jove 's great ordinance shall be here implied To strike him under th ' Etna of his pride ;
To which work lend your hands , and let us cast Where we may set snares for his ranging greatness ;
I think it best , amongst our greatest women : For there is no such trap to catch an upstart As a loose downfall ; for you know their falls Are th'ends of all men 's rising : if great men And wise make scapes to please ad- vantage ' Tis with a woman : women that worst may Still hold men 's candles : they direct and know All things amiss in all men ; and their women All things amiss in them ; through whose charm 'd mouths , We may see all the close scapes of the Court .
When the most royal beast of chase , the hart , ( Being old and cunning in his lairs and haunts ) Can never be discover 'd to the bow , The piece , or hound ; yet where , behind some quitch , He breaks his gall , and rutteth with his hind , The place is mark 'd , and by his venery He still is taken . Shall we then attempt The chiefest mean to that discovery here , And court our greatest ladies ' chiefest women With shows of love and liberal promises ?
Tis but our breath . If something given in hand 158
No doubt of that ; and 'tis the cunning 'st pointOf your devised investigation .
Mo , I have broken The ice to it already with the woman Of our chaste lady , and conceive good hope I shall wade thorough to some wished shoreAt our next meeting .
Nay , there 's small hope there .
Take say of her , my lord , she comes most fitly , And we will to the other .
Starting back ?
Y'are engaged , indeed .
Nay , pray , my lord , forbear .
What , skittish , servant ?
No, my lord , I am not so fit foryour service .
Pray pardon me now , my lord ; mylady expects me .
I 'll satisfy her expectation , as far asan uncle may .
Well said ; a spirit of courtship of all hands . Now mine own Pero , hast thou remembered me for the discovery Ientreated thee to make of thy mistress ?
speak boldly , and be sure of all thingsI have sworn to thee .
Building on that assurance , my lord , I may speak ; and much the rather , because my lady hath not trusted me with that 1 can tell you ; for now -I cannot besaid to betray her .
That 's all one , so we reach ourobjects ; forth , I beseech thee .
To tell you truth , my lord , I havemade a strange discovery .
Excellent , Pero , thou revivest me ;
may I sink quick to perdition if my tonguediscover it .
Tis thus , then : this last night , my lord lay forth , and I watching my lady 's sitting up , stole up at midnight from my pallet ; and ( having before made a hole both through the wall and arras to her inmost chamber ) I saw D'Ambois and herself reading a letter .
D'Ambois ?
Even he , my lord .
Dost thou not dream , wench ?
I swear he is the man .
The devil he is , and thy lady his dam ; why , this was the happiest shot that ever flew ! The just plague of hypocrisy evelled it . Oh , the infinite regions be- :wixt a woman 's tongue and her heart ! is this .our goddess of chastity ? I thought I could not be so sleigh ted , if she had not her fraught besides , and , therefore , plotted this with her woman , never dreaming of D'Ambois . Dear , Pero , I willadvance thee for ever ; but tell me now ;
od 's precious , it transforms me with ad- miration ; sweet Pero , whom should she trust with his conveyance ? Or , all the doors being made sure , how should hisconveyance be made ?
Nay , my lord , that amazes me ; I cannot by any study so much as guessat it .
I swear to your grace , all that I can conjecture touching my lady your niece , is a strong affection she bears to theEnglish Mylor .
All , quod you ? ' Tis enough , Iassure you , but tell me .
I pray thee , resolve me : the duke will never imagine that I am busy about 's wife : hath D'Ambois any privy access toher ?
No, my lord ; D'Ambois neglects her , as she takes it , and is therefore suspicious that either your lady , or the Lady Beaupre hath closely entertainedhim .
By 'r lady , a likely suspicion , and very near the life , if she marks it , especiallyof my wife .
Come , we 'll disguise all with seeming only to have courted ; away , dry palm : sh'as a liver as hard as a biscuit ; a man may go a whole voyage with her , and get nothing but tempests from her windpipe .
Here 's one , I think , has swallowed a porcupine , she casts pricks from hertongue so .
And here 's a peacock seems to have devoured one of the Alps , she has so swelling a spirit , and is so cold of herkindness .
We are no windfalls , my lord ; ye must gather us with the ladder of matrimony , or we 'll hang till we be rotten .
Indeed , that 's the way to make ye right open-arses . But , alas i ye have no portions fit for such husbands as wewish you .
159 PC . Portions , my lord ? yes , and such portions as your principality cannot purchase .
What , woman ? what are thoseportions ?
Riddle my riddle , my lord . - Mo . Ay , marry wench , I think thy portion is a right riddle , a man shall neverfind it out . But let 's hear it .
You shall , my lord .
What 's that , that being most rare 's most cheap ?
That when you sow , you never reap ?
That when it grows most , most you in tt ?
And still you lose it when you win it ;
Tkat when 'tis commonest , 'tis dearest, And when ' tis farthest off , 'tis nearest ?
Is this your great portion ?
Even this , my lord .
Believe me , I cannot riddle it .
No, my lord : 'tis my chastity , whichyou shall neither riddle nor fiddle .
Your chastity ? Let me begin with the end of it ; how is a woman 'schastity nearest a man when 'tis furthest off ?
Why , my lord , when you cannot get it , it goes to th ' heart on you ; and that , I think , comes most near you : and I am sure it shall be far enough off ; and so weleave you to our mercies .
\Exeiint Women .
Farewell , riddle .
Farewell , medlar .
Farewell , winter plum .
Now , my lords , what fruit of our inquisition ? Feel you nothing buddingyet ? Speak , good my Lord Montsurry .
Nothing but this : D'Ambois is negligent in observing the duchess , and therefore she is suspicious that your nieceor my wife closely entertains him .
Your wife , my lord ? Think youthat possible ?
Alas , I know she flies him likeher last hour .
Her last hour ? Why , that comes upon her the more she flies it . Does D'Ambois so , think you ?
That 's not worth the answering Tis miraculous to think with what monsters women 's imaginations engross them wher they yre once enamoured , and wha wonders they will work for their satisfac tion . They will make a sheep valiant , alion fearful .
And an ass confident . Well , mj lord , more will come forth shortly ; get youto the banquet .
Come , my lord ; I have the blindide of one of them .

Vot any wrinkle creaming in their faces When in their hearts are Scylla and Charybdis , Which still are hid in dark and standing fogs , Where never day shines , nothing ever grows , 3ut weeds and poisons , that no statesman knows , ^pr Cerberus ever saw the damned nooks Hid with the veils of women 's virtuous looks ;
But what a cloud of sulphur have I drawnUp to my bosom in this dangerous secret !
Which if my haste with any spark should light , Ere D'Ambois were engaged in some sure plot , I were blown up ; he would be sure my death .
I will conceal all yet , and give more time To D'Ambois ' trial , now upon my hook , He awes my throat ; else like Sybilla 's caveIt should breathe oracles .
Would I had never known it , for before I shall persuade th'importance to Mont- surry , And make him with some studied stra - tagem Train D'Ambois to his wreak , his maid may tell it , Or I ( out of my fiery thirst to play With the fell tiger , up in darkness tied , And give it some light ) make it quite break loose .
I fear it afore heaven , and will not see D'Ambois again , till I have told Montsurry , And set a snare with him to free my fears Who 's there ?
My lord ?
Go call the Count Montsurry , And make the doors fast ; I will speak with noneTill he come to me .
Or else Send you some other , and see all the doors Made safe yourself , I pray ; haste , fly about it .
You 'll spe3k with none but \mh tfo Count . Montsurry i i6o
See even by this , there 's one exception more ;
Your grace must be more firm in the command , Or else shall I as weakly execute .
The Guise shall speak with you ?
He shall , I say .
And Count Montsurry ?
And Count Montsurry .
Your grace must pardon me , that I am bold To urge the clear and full sense of your pleasure ;
Which whensoever I have known , I hopeYour grace will say , I hit it to a hair .
You have .
I hope so , or I would be glad Mo . I pray thee get thee gone , thou art so tedious In the strict form of all thy servicesThat I had better have one negligent .
You hit my pleasure well , when D'Ambois hit you ;
Did you not , think you ?
D'Ambois ? why my lord ?
I pray thee talk no more , but shut the doors :Do what I charge thee .
I will , my lord , and yet I would be glad the wrong I had of D'Ambois Mo . Precious ! then it is a fate that plagues me In this man 's foolery , I may be murther 'd While he stands on protection of his folly .
Avaunt about thy charge .
I go , my lord .
I had my head broke in his faithful service ;
I had no suit the more , nor any thanks , And yet my teeth must still be hit with D'Ambois : D'Ambois , my lord , shall know .
The devil and D'Ambois !

Never was any curious in his placeTo do things justly , but he was an ass ;
We cannot find one trusty that is witty , An r l therefore bear their disproportion .
Grant thou , great star and angel of my life , A sure lease of it but for some few days , That I may clear my bosom of the snake J cherish 'd there , and I will then defy All check to it but Nature 's , and her altars Shall crack with vessels crown 'd with every liquor Drawn from her highest and most bloody humours .
I fear him strangely , his advanced valour Is like a spirit raised without a circle , Endangering him that ignorautly raised him , And for whose fury he hath learnt no limit .
I cannot help it : what should I do more ?
As I was gathering a fit guard to make My passage to the doors , and the doors sure , The man of blood is enter 'd .
Rage of death !
If I had told the secret , and he knew it , Thus had I been endanger 'd : My sweet heart !
How now , what leap 'st thou at ?
O royal object !
Thou dream 'st , awake ; object in th ' empty air ?
Worthy the brows of Titan , worth his chair .
Pray thee , what mean 'st thou ?
See you not a crown Impale the forehead of the great King Monsieur ?
Oh , fie upon thee !
Sir , that is the subject Of all these your retired and sole discourses .
Wilt thou not leave that wrongful supposition ?
Why wrongful , to suppose the doubtless right To the succession worth the thinking on ?
Well , leave these jests ; how I am overjoy 'd With thy wish 'd presence , and how fit thou comest , For of mine honour I was sending for thee .
To what end ?
Only for thy company , Which I have still in thought , but that 's no payment On thy part made with personal appearance .
Thy absence so long suffer 'd , oftentimes Put me in some little doubt thou dost not love me .
Wilt thou do one thing therefore nowsincerely ?
Ay , anything , but killing of the King .
Still in that discord , and ill-taken note , How most unseasonably thou play 'st the cuckoo, In this thy fall of friendship !
Then do not doubt , That there is any act within my nervesBut killing of the King , that is not yours .
I will not , then ; to prove which by my love Shown to thy virtues , and by all fruits else Already sprung from that still-flourishing tree , With whatsoever may hereafter spring , I charge thee utter ( even with all the freedom Both of thy noble nature and thy friend - ship ) The full and plain state of me in thy thoughts .
What , utter plainly what I think of you ?
Plain as truth .
Why , this swims quite against the stream of greatness ;
Great men would rather hear their flatteries , And if they be not made fools , are not wise .
I am no such great fool , and there - fore charge thee Even from the root of thy free heart , display me .
Since you affect it in such serious terms , If yourself first will tell me what you think As freely and as heartily of me, I'll be as open in my thoughts of you .
A bargain , of mine honour ; and make this , That prove we in our full dissectionNever so foul , live still the sounder friends .
What else , sir ? Come , pay me home ; I 'll bide it bravely .
I will , I swear . I think thee then a man That dares as much as a wild horse or tiger ;
As headstrong and as bloody ; and to feed The ravenous wolf of thy most cannibal valour , ( Rather than not employ it ) thou wouldst turn Hackster to any whore , slave to a Jew Or English usurer , to force possessions , And cut men 's throats of mortgaged estates ;
Or thou wouldst 'tire thee like a tinkers strumpet , And murther market-folks , quarrel with sheep , And run as mad as Ajax ; serve a butcher .
Do anything but killing of the King : That in thy valour th'art like other naturals That have strange gifts in nature , but no soul Diffused quite through , to make them of a piece , But stop at humours that are more absurd , Childish and villanous than that hackster , whore , Slave , cut-throat , tinker 's bitch , compared before ;
And in those humours wouldst envy , betray , Slander , blaspheme , change each hour a religion ;
Do anything but killing of the King : That in thy valour ( which is still the dung- hill , To which hath reference all filth in thy ' house ) Thou art more ridiculous and vain-glorious Than any mountebank ; and impudent Than any painted bawd ; which , not to soothe And glorify thee like a Jupiter Hammon , Thou eat 'st thy heart in vinegar ; and thy gall Turns all thy blood to poison , which is cause Of that toad-pool that stands in thy complexion , And makes thee ( with a cold and earthy moisture , Which is the dam of putrefaction , As plague to thy damn 'd pride ) rot as thou livest ;
To study calumnies and treacheries ;
To thy friends ' slaughters like a screech - owl sing , And do all mischiefs but to kill the King .
So ! have you said ?
How think 'st thou ? Do I flatter ?
Speak I not like a trusty friend to thee ?
That ever any man was blest withal ;
So here 's for me . I think you are ( at worst ) No devil , since y 'are like to be no king ;
Of which , with any friend of yours , I 'll layThis poor stilladohere , 'gainst all the stars .
Ay , and 'gainst all your treacheries , which are more ;
That you did never good , but to do ill ^ 162
That your political head is the cursed fount Of all the violence , rapine , cruelty , Tyranny , and atheism flowing through the realm .
That y 'ave a tongue so scandalous , 'twill cut A perfect crystal ; and a breath that will Kill to that wall a spider ; you will jest With God , and your soul to the devil tender For lust ; kiss horror , and with death engender .
That your foul body is a Lernean fenOf all the maladies breeding in all men ;
That you are utterly without a soul ;
And , for your life , the thread of that was spun When Clotho slept , and let her breathing rock Fall in the dirt ; and Lachesis still draws it , Dipping her twisting fingers in a bowl Defiled , and crown 'd with virtue 's forced soul .
And lastly ( which I must for gratitude Ever remember ) that of all my height And dearest life , you are the only spring ,Only in royal hope to kill the king .
Why , now I see thou lovest me ;
fentir Henry , Monsieur , " with a letter ;
Guise , Montsurry , . Bussy , Elynor , Tamyra , Beaupre , Pero , Charlotte ,Annabelle , Pyrha , with four Pages .
' He . Ladies , ye have not done our banquet right , Nor look 'd upon it with those cheerful rays That lately turn 'd your breaths to floods of gold ;
Your looks , methinks , are not drawn out with thoughts So clear and free as heretofore , but foul , As if the thick complexions of menGover n 'd within them .
' Tis not like , my lord, That men in women rule , but contraiy ;
For as the moon ( of all things God created ) Not only is the most appropriate image Or glass to show them how they wax and wane , But in her height and motion likewise bears Imperial influences that command In all their powers , and make them wax and wane ;
So women , that ( of all things made of nothing ) Are the most perfect idols of the moon ( Or stili-unwean 'd sweet moon-calves with white faces ) Not only are patterns of change to men , But as the tender moonshine of their beauties Clears , or is cloudy , make men glad or sad , So then they rule in men , not men in them .
But here the moons are changed , ( as the King notes ) And either men rule in them , or some power Beyond their voluntary faculty :For nothing can recover their lost faces .
None can be always one : our griefs and joys Hold several sceptres in us , and have times .
For their predominance : which grief now , in them Doth prove as proper to his diadem .
And grief 's a natural sickness of the blood , That time to part asks , as his coming had , Only slight fools grieved suddenly are glad ;
A man may say to a dead man , " Be re - vived , " As well as to . one sorrowful , " Be not grieved . "
163 n Your servant cannot help ; authority here Goes with corruption : something like some States , That back worst men : valour to them must creep That , to themselves left , would fear him asleep.
Ye all take that for granted that doth rest Yet to be proved ; we all are as we were , As merry and as free in thought as ever .
Gu . And why then can ye not disclose your thoughts ?
Methinks the man hath answer 'd for us well .
The man ? why , madam , d'ye not know his name ?
Man is a name of honour for a king : 'Additions take away from each chief thing : The school of modesty , not to learn , learns dames : They sit in high forms there , that know men 's names .
' Mo . Hark ! sweetheart , here 's a bar set to your valour : It cannot enter here : no , not to notice Of what your name is ; your great eagle 's beak ; ( Should you fly at her ) had as good en- counter An Albion cliff , as her more craggy liver .
I 'll not attempt her , sir ; her sight and name : ( By which I only know her ) doth deter me .
So they do all men else .
You would say soIf you knew all .
' Ta . Knew all , my lord ? What mean you ?

That you know ? speak it .
No, 'tis enough , I feel it .
But , methinks Her courtship is more pure than heretofore ;
True courtiers should be modest , but not nice , Bold , but not impudent , pleasure love , not vice .
Sweetheart 1 come hither , what if one should make Horns at Montsurry ? Would it not strike him jealous ' Through all the proofs of his chaste lady 's virtues ?
If he be wise , not .
What ? Not if I should name the gardener That I would have him think hath grafted him ?
So the large licence that your greatness uses To jest at all men , may be taught indeed To make a difference of the grounds you play on , Both in the men you scandal , and the matter .
As how ? as how ?
Perhaps led with a train , where you may have Your nose made less and slit , your eyes thrust out .
Peace , peace , I pray thee peace .
Who dares do that ? the brother of his king ?
Were your king brother in you ;
all your powers ( Stretch 'd in the arms of great men and their bawds ) , Set close down by you ; all your stormy laws Spouted with lawyers ' mouths ; and gush - ing blood , Like -to so many torrents ; all your glories ( Making you terrible , like enchanted flames Fed with bare cockscombs ; and with crooked hams ) , All your prerogatives , your shames and tortures ;
All daring heaven , and opening hell about you ;
Were I the man ye wrong 'd so and pro- voked , Though ne 'er so much beneath you , like a box-tree I would ( out of the roughness of my root ) Ram hardness , in my lowness , and like death Mounted on earthquakes , I would trot through all Honours and horrors : thorough foul and fair And from your whole strength toss you into the air .
Go , th'art a devil ; such another spirit Could not be 'still 'd from all th ' Armenian dragons .
O my love 's glory ; heir to all I have ;
That 's all I can say , and that all I swear .
If thou outlive me , as I know thou must , Or else hath nature no proportion 'd end To her great labours ; she hath breathed a mind Into thy entrails , of desert to swellInto another great Augustus Csesar ;
164
And should that perish like a common spirit , Nature 's a courtier and regards no merit .
Here 's nought but whispering with us ; like a calm Before a tempest , when the silent air Lays her soft ear close to the earth to hearken For that she fears steals on to ravish her ;
Some fate doth join our ears to hear it coming .
Come , my brave eagle , let 's to covert fly ;
I see almighty ^Ether in the smoke Of all his clouds descending ; and the skyHid in the dim ostents of tragedy .
{Exit Henry with D'Ambois and Ladies .
Now stir the humour , and begin the brawl .
The King and D'Ambois now are grown all one .
Mo , Nay , they are two , my lord .
How 's that ?
No more .
I must have more , my lord .
What , more than two ?
How monstrous is this !
Why ?
You make me horns .
Not I ; it is a work without my power , Married men 's ensigns are not made with fingers ;
Of divine fabric they are , not men 's hands ;
Your wife , you know , is a mere Cynthia , And she must fashion horns out of her nature .
But doth she , dare you charge her ?
speak , false prince .
I must not speak , my lord ; but if you 'll use The learning of a nobleman , and read , Here 's something to those points ; soft , you must pawn Your honour having read it to return it .
Not I , I pawn mine honour for a Mo . You must not buy it under .

What says he ?
You must make good fhe rest .
How fares my lord ?
Takes my love anything to heart ne says ?
Come y 'are a Ta . What , my lord ?
The plague of HerodFeast in his rotten entrails .
Will you wreak Your anger 's just cause given by him , on me .
By him ?
By him , my lord , I have admired You could all this time be at concord with him , That still hath placed such discords on your honour .
Perhaps 'tis with some proud string of my wife 's .
How 's that , my lord ?
Your tongue will still admire,Till my head be the miracle of the world .
Ta , O , woe is me !

Madam , be comforted ; my lord but tries you .
Madam ! help , good my lord , are you not moved ?
Do your set looks print in your words your thoughts ?
Sweet lord , clear up those eyes , for shame of noblesse , Unbend that masking forehead ; whence is it You rush upon her with these Irish wars , More full of sound than hurt ? But 'tis enough , You have shot home , your words are in her heart ;
She has not lived to bear a trial now .
Look up , my love , and by this kiss receive My soul amongst thy spirits for supplyTo thine , chased with my fury .
Oh , my lord , I have too long lived to hear this from you .
Twasfrom my troubled blood , and not from me ;
I know not how I fare ; a sudden night Flows through my entrails , and a headlong chaos Murmurs within me , which I must digest ;
And not drown her in my confusions , That was my life 's joy , being best in-
Sweet , you must needs forgive me , that my love ( Like to a fire disdaining his suppression ) Raged being discouraged ; my whole heart is wounded When any least thought in you is but touch d , And shall be till I know your formermerits ;
BUSSY D 1 AM BO IS.
165 Your name and memory altogether crave In just oblivion their eternal grave ;
And then you must hear from me , there 's no mean In any passion I shall feel for you ;
Love is a razor cleansing being well used , But fetcheth blood still being the least abused ;
To tell you briefly all : the man that left me When you appear 'd , did turn me worse than woman , And stabb 'd me to the heart thus , with his fingers .
Oh , happy woman ! Comes my stain from him , It is my beauty , and that innocence proves ;
That slew Chymoera , rescued PeleusFrom all the savage beasts in Pelion ;
And raised the chaste Athenian prince from hell ;
All suffering with me , they for women 's lusts , I for a man 's , that the Augean stableOf his foul sin would empty in my lap ;
How his guilt shunn 'd me ! sacred inno - cence That where thou fear 'st , art dreadful ; and his face Turn 'd in flight from thee , that had thee in chase ;
Come , bring me to him ; I will tell the serpent Even to his venom 'd teeth ( from whose cursed seed A pitch 'd field starts up 'twixt my lord and me ) That his throat lies , and he shall curse his fingers , For being so govern 'd by his filthy soul .
I know not if himself will vaunt t 'have been , The princely author of the slavish sin , Or any other ; he would have resolved me Had you not come ; not by his word , but writing , Would t have sworn to give it him again , And paw n 'd mine honour to him for a paper .
See how he flies me still ; 'tis a foul heart That fears his own hand ; good , my lord , make haste To see the dangerous paper ; papers hold Oft-times the forms and copies of our souls , And , though the world despise them , are the prizes Of all our honours ; make your honour then A hostage for it , and with it conferMy nearest woman here , in all she knows ;
Who ( if the sun or Cerberus could have seen Any stain in me ) might as much as they ;
And , Pero , here I charge thee by my love , And all proofs of it ( which I might call bounties ) , By all that thou hast seen seem good in me , And all the ill which thou shouldst spit from thee , By pity of the wound this touch hath given me , Not as thy mistress now , but a poor woman , To death given over ; rid me of my pains , Pour on thy powder ; clear thy breast of me ;
My lord is only here ; here speak thy worst , Thy best will do me mischief ; if thou sparest me , Never shine good thought on thy memory .
Resolve , my lord , and leave me desperate .
My lord ? my lord hath play 'd a prodigal 's part , To break his stock for nothing ; and an in- solent , To cut a gordian when he could not loose it ;
What violence is this , to put true fire To a false train ? To blow up long-crown 'd peace With sudden outrage , and believe a man Sworn to the shame of women , 'gainst a woman , Born to their honours ? But I will to him .
No, I will write ( for I shall never more Meet wijh the fugitive ) where I will defy him , Were he ten times the brother of my king .
To him , my lord , and I 'll to cursing him .

I am suspicious , my most honour 'd father , By some of Monsieur 's cunning passages , That his still ranging and contentious nos- trils , To scent the haunts of mischief have so used The vicious virtue of his busy sense , That he trails hotly of him , and will rouse him , i66
And therefore have entreated your deep skill In the command of good aerial spirits , To assume these magic rites , and call up one To know if any have reveal 'd unto himAnything touching my dear love and me .
Fr , Good son , you have amazed me but to make The least doubt of it , it concerns so nearly The faith and reverence of my name and order .
Yet will I justify , upon my soul , All I have done , if any spirit i' th ' earth or airCan give you the resolve , do not despair .
Tamyra enters with Pero and her maid , bearing a letter .
Away t deliver it : O may my lines
With which are all things to be fear 'd , affrighted :Father !
Ascendit Bussy with Comolet .
How is it with my honour 'd mistress ?
O servant , help , and save me from the gripes Of shame and infamy . Our love is known : Your Monsieur hath a paper where is writSome secret tokens that decipher it .
What insensate stock , Or rude inanimate vapour without fashion , What cold dull northern brain , what fool but he Durst take into his Epimethean breast A box of such plagues as the danger yields Incurr 'd in this discovery ? He had better Ventured his breast in the consuming reach Of the hot surfeits cast out of the clouds , Or stood the bullets that ( to wreak the sky )
We soon will take the darkness from his face
That did that deed of darkness ; we will know What now the Monsieur and your husband do ;
What is contam 'd within the secret paper Ofifer 'd by Monsieur , and your love 's events : To which ends , honour 'd daughter , at your motion , I have put on these exorcising rites , And , by my power of learned holiness Vouchsafed me from above , I will com- mandOur resolution of a raised spirit .
Good father , raise him in some beauteous form , That with least terror I may brook his sight .
Stand sure together , then , whate 'er ye see, And stir not , as ye tender all our lives .

I would see What now the Monsieur and Mountsurry do ;
And see the secret paper that the Monsieur Offer 'd to Count Montsurry , longing much To know on what events the secret lovesOf these two honour 'd persons shall arrive .
Why call 'dst thou me to this ac - cursed light To these light purposes ? I am emperor Of that inscrutable darkness where are hid All deepest truths , and secrets never seen , All which I know , and command legions Of knowing spirits that can do more than these .
Any of this my guard that circle me In these blue fires , and out of whose dim fumesVast murmurs use to break , and from their .

167 | Of the inferior ablest ministers , ! And he could not resolve me ; send one then ; Out of thine own command , to fetch the paper , That Monsieur hath to show to Count Montsurry .
I will . Cartophylax , thou that pro- perly Hast in thy power all papers so insciibed , Glide through all bars to it and fetch that paper .
I will . \_A torch removes .
Till he returns , great prince of dark - ness , Tell me if Monsieur and the Count Mont- surryAre yet encounter 'd ?
Both them and the GuiseAre now together .
Show us all their persons , And represent the place , with all their actions .
The spirit will straight return ; and then I 'll show thee .
See , he is come ; why brought 'st thou not the paper ?
He hath prevented me , and got a spirit Raised by another great in our command, To take the guard of it before I came .
This is your slackness , not t ' invoke our powers When first your acts set forth to their effects ;
Yet shall you see it and themselves : behold They come here , and the Earl now holdsthe paper .
May we not hear them ?
No, be still and see .
I will go fetch the paper .
Do not stir ;
There 's too much distance and too many locks Twixt you and them , how near soe 'er they seem , For any man to interrupt their secrets .
O honour 'd spirit ^ fly into the fancy Of my offended lord , and do not let him Believe what there the wicked man hath written .
Persuasion hath already enter 'd him Beyond reflection ; peace till their departure .
There is a glass of ink where you may see How to make ready blackfaced tragedy : You now discern , I hope , through all her paintings , Her gasping wrinkles , and fame 's sepulchres .
Think you he feigns , my lord ?
What hold you now ?
Do we malign your wife , or honour you ?
What , stricken dumb ! Nay fie ,lord , be not daunted ;
Your case is common ; were it ne 'er so rare , Bear it as rarely ; now to laugh weremanly ;
A worthy man should imitate the weather That sings in tempests , and being clear is silent .
Go home , my lord , and force your wife to write Such loving lines to D'Ambois as she used When she desired his presence .
Do , my lord , And make her name her conceal 'd mes - senger , That close and most inennerable pander , That passeth all our studies to exquire ;
By whom convey the letter to her love : And so you shall be sure to have him come Within the thirsty reach of your revenge ;
Before which , lodge an ambush in her chamber Behind the arras , of your stoutest men All close and soundly arm 'd ; and let them share A spirit amongst them that would serve athousand .
Yet stay a little ; see , she sends for you .
Poor , loving lady ; she 'll make all good yet , Think you not so , my lord ?

That was cruelly done , i'faith .
' Twas nobly done .
And I forgive his lordship from my soul .
Then much good do 't thee , Pero !
hast a letter ?
I hope it rather be a bitter volumeOf worthy curses for your perjury .
To you , my lord .
To me ? now , out upon her .
Let me see , my lord , Mo . You shall presently : how fares myPero ?
Who 's there ? Take in this maid , sh'as caught a clap , i68

Out of the black lines , and torment his soul .
Hath my lord slain my woman ?
No, she lives .
What shall become of us ?
All I can say , Being call 'd thus late , is brief , and darkly this : If D'Ambois ' mistress dye not her white hand In his forced blood , he shall remain un- touch 'd : So , father , shall yourself , but by yourself : To make this augury plainer : when the voice Of D'Ambois shall invoke me , I will rise , Shining in greater light : and show him all That will betide ye all ; meantime be wise, And curb his valour with your policies .

He will , be sure .
It must be shortly then : For his dark words have tied my thoughts on knots ,Till he dissolve , and free them .
In meantime , Dear servant , till your powerful voice revoke him , Be sure to use the policy he advised : Lest fury in your too quick knowledge taken Of our abuse , and your defence of meAccuse me more than any enemy ;
And , father , you must on my lord impose Your holiest charges , and the Church 's power To temper his hot spirit and disperse The cruelty and the blood I know his hand Will shower upon our heads , if you put not Your finger to the storm , and hold it up , As my dear servant here must do with Monsieur .
I 'll soothe his plots ; and strow my hate with smiles Till all at once the close mines of my heart Rise at full date , and rush into his blood : I 'll bind his arm in silk , and rub his flesh , To make the vein swell , that his soul may gush Into some kennel , where it longs to lie, And policy shall be flank 'd with policy .
Yet shall the feeling centre where we meet Groan with the weight of my approaching feet ;
I 'll make th'inspired thresholds of his court Sweat with the weather of my horrid steps , Before I enter ; yet will I appearLike calm security , before a ruin ;
A politician must like lightning melt The very marrow , and not taint the skin : His ways must not be seen ; the superficies Of the green centre must not taste his feet ;
When hell is plow 'd up with his wounding tracts ;
And all his harvest reap 'd by hellish facts .

Montsurry bare , unbraced , pulling Tamyra in by the hair , Friar . One bearing light , a standish and paper , which setsa table .
O help me , father .
Impious earl , forbear .
Take violent hand from her , or by mine order The King shall force thee .
' Tis not violent ; come you not willingly ?
Yes , good my lord .
My lord , remember that your soul must seek Her peace , as well as your revengeful blood ;
You ever to this hour have proved your- self A noble , zealous , and obedient son, T'our holy mother ; be not an apostate ;
Your wife 's offence serves not , were it the worst You can imagine , without greater proofs , To sever your eternal bonds and hearts ;
Much less to touch her with a bloody hand ;
Nor is it manly , much less husbandly , To expiate any frailty in your wife With churlish strokes or beastly odds of strength : The stony birth of clouds will touch no laurel ;
Nor any sleeper ; your wife is your laurel , And sweetest sleeper ; do not touch her then ;
169 Be not more rude than the wild seed of vapour , To her that is more gentle than that rude ;
In whom kind nature suffer 'd one offenceBut to set off her other excellence .
Good father , leave us ; interrupt no more The course I must run formine honoursake .
Rely on my love to her , which her fault Cannot extinguish ; will she but disclose Who was the secret minister of her love , And through what maze he served it , we are friends .
It is a damn 'd work to pursue those secrets , That would ope more sin , and prove springs of slaughter ;
Nor is't a path for Christian feet to tread , But out of all way to the health of souls , A sin impossible to be forgiven ;
Which he that dares commit Mont . Good father , cease ; your terrors Tempt not a man distracted ; I am aptTo outrages that I shall ever rue ;
I will not pass the verge that bounds a Christian , Nor break the limits of a man nor husband .
Then God inspire you both with thoughts and deeds Worthy his high respect , and your own souls .
Father !
I warrant thee , my dearest daughter , He will not touch thee ; think 'st thou him a pagan ?
His honour and his soul lies for thy safety .

Who shall remove the mountain from my breast , Ope the seven-times-heat furnace of my thoughts , And set fit outcries for a soul in hell ?

Shorten the world , preventing the last breathThat kills the living , and regenerates death .
My lord , my fault ( as you may censure it With too strong arguments ) is past your pardon : But how the circumstances may excuse me Heaven knows , and your more temperate mind hereafter May let my penitent miseries make you know .
Hereafter ? Tis a supposed in- finite , That from this point will rise eternally : Fame grows in going ; in the 'scapes of virtue Excuses damn her : they be fires in cities Enraged with those winds that less lights extinguish .
Come , syren , sing , and dash against my rocks Thy ruffian galley , rigg 'd with quench for lust ;
Sing , and put all the nets into thy voice With which thou drew 'st into thy strumpet 's lap The spawn of Venus ; and in which ye danced ;
That , in thy lap 's stead , I may dig his tomb , And quit his manhood with a woman 's sleight , Who never is deceived in her deceit .
Sing ( that is , write ) , and then take from mine eyes The mists that hide the most inscrutable pander That ever lapp 'd up an adulterous vomit ;
That I may see the devil , and survive To be a devil , and then learn to wive : That I may hang him , and then cut him down , Then cut him up , and with my soul 's beams search The cranks and caverns of his brain , and study The errant wilderness of a woman 's face ;
Where men cannot get out , for all the comets That have been lighted at it ; though they know That adders lie a-sunning in their smiles , That basilisks drink their poison from their eyes , And no way there to coast out to their hearts ;
Yet still they wander there , and are not stay 'd Till they be fetter 'd , nor secure before All cares devour them ; nor in human consort 170
Why write you not ?
O , good my lord , forbear In wreak of great faults , to engender greater , And make my love 's corruption generate murther .
It follows needfully as child and parent ;
The chain-shot of thy lust is yet aloft , And it must murther ; 'tis thine own dear twin : No man can add height to a woman 's sin .
Vice never doth her just hate so provoke, As when she rageth under virtue 's cloak .
Write : for it must be ; by this ruthless steel , By this impartial torture , and the death Thy tyrannies have invented in my entrails , To quicken life in dying , and hold up The spirits in fainting , teaching to preserveTorments in ashes , that will ever last .
Speak ! Will you write ?
Sweet lord , enjoin my sin Some other penance than what makes it worse ;
Hide in some gloomy dungeon my loathed face , And let condemned murtherers let me down ( Stopping their noses ) my abhorred food .
Hang me in chains , and let me eat these arms That have offended ; bind me face to face To some dead woman , taken from the cart Of execution , till death and timeIn grains of dust dissolve me ; I 'll endure ;
Or any torture that your wrath 's inventionCan fright all pity from the world withal ;
But to betray a friend with show of friend - ship , That is too common , for the rare revenge Your rage affecteth ; here then are my breasts , Last night your pillows ; here my wretched arms , As late the wished confines of your life ;
Now break them as you please , and all the bounds Of manhood , noblesse , and religion .
O Lord I Mont . Till thou writest , I 'll write in wounds ( my wrong 's fit cha - racters) Thy right of sufferance . Write .
Oh , kill me , kill me ;
Dear husband , be not crueller than death ;
You have beheld some Gorgon ; feel , oh , feel How you are turn 'd to stone ; with my heart-blood Dissolve yourself again , or you will growInto the image of all tyranny .
As thou art of adultery , I will still Prove thee my parallel , being most a monster ;
Thus I express thee yet .

Ay , for thy monstrous idol is not done yet ;
This tool hath wrought enough ; now ,torture , use .
This other engine on th ' habituate powersOf her thrice-damn 'd and whorish fortitude .
Use the most madding pains in her that ever Thy venoms soak 'd through , making most of death ;
That she may weigh her wrongs with them , and then Stand vengeance on thy steepest rock , a victor .
Oh , who is turn 'd into my lord and husband ?
Husband ! My lord ! None but my lord and husband !
Heaven , I ask thee remission of my sins , Not of my pains ; husband , oh , help me , husband !
Ascendit Friar with a sword drawn .
Poor man ; oh , my father , Father , look up ; oh , let me down , my lord, And I will write .
Author of prodigies !
What new flame breaks out of the firma - ment , That turns up counsels never known . before ? , Now is it true , earth moves , and heaven stands still ;
Even heaven itself must see and suffer ill ;
171 Her back part upwards , and with that she braves This hemisphere , that long her mouth hath mock 'd ;
The gravity of her religious face , ( Now grown too weighty with her sacrilege And here discer n 'd sophisticate enough ) Turns to th ' antipodes ; and all the forms That her illusions have imprest in her , Have eaten through her back ; and now all see , How she is riveted with hypocrisy : Was this the way ? was he the mean betwixt you ?
He was , he was , kind worthy man , he was .
Write , write a word or two .
I will , I will .
Well might he die for thought ;
methinks the frame And shaken joints of the whole world should crack To see her parts so disproportionate ;
And that his general beauty cannot standWithout these stains in the particular man .
Why wander I so far ? here , here was she That was a whole world without spot to me , Though now a world of spots ; oh , what a lightning Is man 's delight in women ! what a bubble , He builds his state , fame , life on , when he marries !
Since all earth 's pleasures are so short and small , The way t 'enjoy it , is t 'abjure it all ;
Enough : I must be messenger myself , Disguised like this strange creature : in , I 'll after , To see what guilty light gives this cave eyes , And to the world sing new impieties .

Now shall we see , that nature hath no end 1 In her great works , responsive to their worths , That she that makes so many eyes , and souls , To see and foresee , is stark blind herself ;
And as illiterate men say Latin prayersi By rote , of heart and daily iteration ;
In whose hot zeal , a man would think they knew What they ran so away with , and were sure To have rewards proportion d to their labours ;
Yet may implore their own confusions For anything they know , which oftentimes It falls out they incur : so Nature lays A deal of stuff together , and by use , Or by the mere necessity of matter , Ends such a work , fills it , or leaves it empty Of strength , or virtue , error or clear truth ;
Not knowing what she does ; but usually Gives that which she calls merit to a man , And belief must arrive him on huge riches , Honour , and happiness , that effects his ruin ;
Even as in ships of war , whose lasts of powder Are laid , men think , to make them last , and guards , When a disorder 'd spark that powder taking , Blows up with sudden violence and horror Ships that kept empty , had sail 'd long with terror .
He that observes , but like a worldly man , That which doth oft succeed , and by th ' events Values the worth of things ; will think it true , That nature works at random , just with you ;
But with as much proportion she may make A thing that from the feet up to the throat Hath all the wondrous fabric man should have , And leave it headless for a perfect man , As give a full man valour , virtue , learning , Without an end more excellent than those , On whom she no such worthy part bestows .
Yet shall you see it here , here will be one Young , learned , valiant , virtuous , and full mann 'd ;
One on whom Nature spent so rich a hand , That , with an ominous eye , she wept to see So much consumed her virtuous treasury .
Yet , as the winds sing through a hollow tree , And ( since it lets them pass through ) lets it j stand But a tree solid ( since it gives no way I 172
So this whole man , so this full creature now , { That will not wind with every crooked way , Trod by the servile world ) shall reel and fall Before the frantic puffs of blind-born chance , That pipes through empty men , and makes them dance ;
Not so the sea raves on the Lybian sands ,Tumbling her billows in each others ' neck ;
Not so the surges of the Euxine sea ( Near to the frosty pole , where free Bootes From those dark deep waves turns his radiant team ) Swell being enraged , even from their in- most drop , As Fortune swings about the restless stateOf virtue , now thrown into all men 's hate .
Away , my lord , you are perfectly disguised , Leave us to lodge your ambush .
Speed me , vengeance . {Exit .
Resolve , my masters , you shall meet with one Will try what proofs your privy coats are made on ;
When he is enter 'd , and you hear us stamp,Approach , and make all sure .
We will , my lord . {Exeunt .
D'Ambois with two Pages with tapers .
Sit up to-night , and watch ; I 'll speak with none But the old Friar , who bring to me .
We will , sir . {Exeunt .
What violent heat is this ? Me- thinks the fire Of twenty lives doth on a sudden flash Through all my faculties ; the air goes high In this close chamber , and the frighted earth { Thunder .
Trembles , and shrinks beneath me ; the whole house Nods with his shaken burthen ; bless me , heaven !
Note what I want , my son , andbe forewarn 'd ;
there are bloody deeds past and to come : 1 cannot stay ; a fate doth ravish me ;
I 'll meet thee in the chamber of thy love .

And now his restless spirit would forewarn me Of some plot dangerous and imminent .
Note what he wants ? He wants his upper weed , He wants his life and body ; which of these Should be the want he means , and may supply me With any fit forewarning ? This strange vision ( Together with the dark prediction Used by the Prince of Darkness that - was raised By this embodied shadow ) stir my thoughts With reminiscion of the spirit 's promise , Who told me , that by any invocation I should have power to raise him , though it wanted The powerful words and decent rites of art ;
Never had my set brain such need of spirit T instruct and cheer it ; now , then , I will claim Performance of his free and gentle vow T' appear in greater light , and make more plain His rugged oracle . I long to know How my dear mistress fares , and be in- form 'd What hand she now holds on the troubled blood Of her incensed lord . Methought the spirit ( When he had utter 'd his perplex 'd presage ) Threw his changed countenance headlong into clouds , His forehead bent , as it would hide his face , He knock 'd his chin against his darken 'd breast , And struck a churlish silence through his powers .
Terror of darkness ! O , thou king of flames !
That with thy music-footed horse dost strike The clear light out of crystal on dark earth , And hurl 'st instructive fire about the world , Wake , wake the drowsy and enchanted night , That sleeps with dead eyes in this heavy riddle ;
173 Sticks his far-darted beams , whose eyes are made To shine in darkness , and see ever best Where sense is blindest : open now the heart Of thy abashed oracle , that for fear , Of some ill it includes , would fain lie hid , And rise thou with it in thy greater light .

When will she send ?
Soon as I set again , where late I rose .
Is the old Friar slain ?
No, and yet lives not .
Died he a natural death ?
He did .
Who thenWill my dear mistress send ?
I must not tell thee .
Who lets thee ?
Fate .
Who are fate 's ministers ?
The Guise and Monsieur .
I must farewell , however : though I die , My death consenting with his augury ;
Should not my powers obey when she commands , My motion must be rebel to my will : My will to life : if , when I have obey 'd , Her hand should so reward me , they must arm it , Bind me or force it : or , I lay my life , She rather would convert it many timesOn her own bosom , even to many deaths ;
Who 's there ? Look to the door , and let him in , Though politic Monsieur or the violent Guise .
Hail to my worthy son .
Oh , lying spirit !
To say the Friar was dead j I 'll now believe Nothing of all his forged predictions .
My kind and honour 'd father , well revived , I have been frighted with your death , and mine , And told my mistress ' hand should be my deathIf I obey 'd this summons .
I believed Your love had been much clearer than to give Any such doubt a thought , for she is clear , And having freed her husband 's jealousy ( Of which her much abused hand here is witness ) She prays , for urgent cause , your instant presence .
Why , then your prince of spirits may be call 'd The prince of liars .
Holy Writ so calls him .
What , writ in blood ?
Ay , 'tis the ink of lovers .
O , 'tis a sacred witness of her love .
So much elixir of her blood as this Dropt in the lightest dame , would make her firm As heat to fire : and like to all the signs,Commands the life confined in all my veins ;
O , how it multiplies my blood with spirit , And makes me apt t 'encounter , death and hell .
But come , kind father , you fetch me to heaven , And to that end your holy weed was given .

Up with these stupid thoughts , still loved daughter , And strike away this heartless trance of anguish .
Be like the sun , and labour in eclipses ;
Look to the end of woes : oh , can you sit Mustering the horrors of your servant 's slaughter ( So urged by your hand , and so imminent )
O father ! have my dumb woes waked your death ?
When will our human griefs be at their height ?
Man is a tree that hath no top in cares , No root in comforts ; all his power to live Is given to no end , but t 'have power to grieve .
' Tis the just curse of our abused creation , Which we must suffer here , and 'scape hereafter : He hath the great mind that submits to all He sees inevitable ; he the small That carps at earth , and her foundation shaker , And rather than himself , will mend his maker .
Your true friend , Led by your husband , shadow 'd in my weed , Now enters the dark vault .
But , my dearest father , Why will not you appear to him yourself , And see that none of these deceits annoy him ?
My power is limited ; alas ! I cannot .
All that I can do See , the cave opens .

Murther 'd ? I know not what that Hebrew means : That word had ne 'er been named had all been D'Ambois .
Murther 'd ? By heaven he is my murtherer That shows me not a murtherer ; what such bug Abhorreth not the very sleep of D'Ambois ?
Murther 'd ? who dares give all the room I see To D'Ambois ' reach ? or look with any odds His fight i'th ' face , upon whose hand sits death ;
Whose sword hath wings , and every feather pierceth ?
| If I 'scape Monsieur 's 'pothecary shops , j Foutre for Guise 's shambles ! 'twas ill plotted \ They should have maul 'd me here , | When I was rising . I am up and ready .
Let in my politic visitants , let them in , Though entering like so many moving armours , Fate is more strong than arms , and sly than treason, And I at all parts buckled in my fate .
Gu ' \ Why enter not the coward villains ?
Dare they not come ?
They come .
1st Mu. Come all at once .
Back , coward murtherers , back .
Defend us , heaven .

No, slave , nor goest thou off .
Stand you so firm ? Will it not enter here ?
You have a face yet ; so in thy life 's flameI burn the first rites to my mistress ' fame .
Breathe thee , brave son , against the other charge .
Oh , is it true then that my sense first told 'me ?
Is my kind father dead ?
He is , my love .
Twas the Earl , my husband , in his weed that brought thee .
That was a speeding sleight , and well resembled .
Where is that angry Earl , my lord ? Come forth And show your own face in your own affair ;
Take not into your noble veins the blood Of these base villains , nor the light reports Of blister 'd tongues , for clear and weighty truth : But me against the world , in pure defence Of your rare lady , to whose spotless name I stand here as a bulwark , and project A life to her renown , that ever yet Hath been untainted , even in envy 's eye, And where it would protect a sanctuary .
Brave Earl , come forth , and keep your scandal in : ' Tis not our fault if you enforce the spotNor the wreak yours if you perform it not .
Cowards , a fiend or spirit beat yeoff ?
I will not touch him : take your life , my lord , And be appeased : O , then the coward Fates Have maim 'd themselves , and -ever lost their honour .
What have ye done , slaves ?
: irreligious lord !
Forbear them , father ; 'tis enough for me That Guise and Monsieur , death and destiny , Come behind D'Ambois . Is my body , then , ' But penetrable flesh ? And must my mind Follow my blood ? Can my divine part add No aid to th'earthly in extremity ?
Then these divines are but for form , not fact : Man is of two sweet courtly friends com- pact , A mistress and a servant ; let my deathDefine life nothing but a courtier 's breath .
Nothing is mtt .le of nought , of all things made , Their abstract being a dream but of a shade .
I 'll not complain to earth yet , but to heaven , And , like a man , look upwards even in death .
And if Vespasian thought in majestyAn emperor might die standing , why not I ?
Nay , without help , in which I will exceed him ;
Prop me , true sword , as thou hast ever done : The equal thought I bear of life and death Shall make me faint on no side ; I am up ;
Here like a Roman statue I will stand Till death hath made me marble : oh , my fame , Live in despite of murther ; take thy wings And haste thee where the grey-eyed morn perfumes Her rosy chariot with Sabsean spices , Fly , where the evening from th'Iberian vales , Takes on her swarthy shoulders Hecate , Crown 'd with a grove of oaks : fly where men feel The cunning axletree : and those that suffer Beneath the chariot of the snowy Bear : And tell them all that D'Ambois now is hasting To the eternal dwellers ; that a thunder Of all their sighs together ( for their frailties Beheld in me ) may quit my worthless fallWith a fit volley for my funeral .
Forgive thy murtherers .
Bu , I forgive them all ;
And you , my lord , their fautor ; for true sign Of which unfeign 'd remission , take my sword ;
Take it , and only give it motion , And it shall find the way to victory By his own brightness , and th'inherent valour My fight hath still 'd into't , with charms of spirit .
Now let me pray you that my weighty blood Laid in one scale of your impartial spleen , May sway the forfeit of my worthy love Weigh 'd in the other ; and be reconciled With all forgiveness to your matchless wife .
Forgive thou me , dear servant , and this hand That led thy life to this unworthy end ;
Forgive it , for the blood with which 'tis stain 'd , In which I writ the summons of thy death ;
The forced summons , by this bleeding wound , By this here in my bosom ; and by this That makes me hold up both my hands imbruedFor thy dear pardon .
O , my heart is broken ;
Fate , nor these murtherers , Monsieur , nor the Guise , Have any glory in my death , but this, This killing spectacle , this prodigy ;
My sun is turn 'd to blood , in whose red beams Pindus and Ossa hid in drifts of snow , Laid on my heart and liver ; from their veins Melt like two hungry torrents ; eating rocks Into the ocean of all human life , And make it bitter , only with my blood .
O frail condition of strength , valour , virtue , In me , like warning fire upon the top Of some steep beacon , on a steeper hill , Made to express it : like a falling star Silently glanced , that like a thunderbolt Look 'd to have stuck and shook the firma - I ment . { Moritur . \ T76
Farewell , brave relics of a complete man ;
Look up and see thy spirit made a star , Join flames with Hercules ; and when thou sett 'st Thy radiant forehead in the firmament , Make the vast crystal crack with thy receipt ;
Spread to a world of fire ; and th'aged skyCheer with new sparks of old humanity .
Son of the earth , whom my unrested soul , Rues t 'have begotten in the faith of heaven ;
i ( Since thy revengeful spirit hath rejected The charity it commands , and the re - mission To serve and worship the blind rage of blood ) Assay to gratulate and pacify \ The soul fled from this worthy by per- forming The Christian reconcilement he besought Betwixt thee and thy lady , let her wounds 1 Manlessly digg 'd in her , be eased and cured With blame of thine own tears ; or be assured : Never to rest free from my haunt and horror .
See how she merits this ; still sitting by , And mourning his fall more than her own fault .
Remove , dear daughter , and content thy husband ;
So piety wills thee , and thy servant 's peace .
O wretched piety , that art so dis - tract In thine own constancy ; and in thy right Must be unrighteous ; if I right my friend I wrong my husband ; if his wrong I shun , The duty of my friend I leave undone ;
111 plays on both sides ; here and there , itriseth ;
No place , no good , so good , but ill compriseth ;
My soul more scruple breeds , than myblood , sin .
Virtue imposeth more than any stepdame ;
O had I never married but for form , Never vow 'd faith but purposed to de ceive , Never made conscience of any sin , But cloak 'd it privately and made it common ;
Nor never honour 'd been , in blood , or mind , Happy had I been then , as others are Of the like licence ; I had then beenhonour 'd ;
Lived without envy ; custom had be numb 'd All sense of scruple , and all note of frailty : My fame had been untouch 'd , my heart unbroken : But ( shunning all ) I strike on all offence , husband ! dear friend ! O my conscience !
Come , let 's away ; my senses are not proofAgainst those plaints .
\Exeunt Guise , Monsieur : D'Ambois is borne off .
I must not yield to pity , nor to love So servile and so traitorous : cease , my blood To wrastle with my honour , fame , and judgment : Away , forsake my house , forbear com- plaints Where thou hast bred them : here all things are full Of their own shame and sorrow ; leave my house .
Sweet lord , forgive me , and I will be gone , And till these wounds , that never balm shall close Till death hath enter 'd at them , so I love them , Being open 'd by your hands , by death be cured , 1 never more will grieve you with my sight , Never endure that any roof shall part Mine eyes and heaven ; but to the open deserts ( Like to hunted tigers ) I will fly : Eating my heart , shunning the steps of men , And look on no side till I be arrived .
I do forgive thee , and upon my knees , With hands held up to heaven , wish that mine honour Would suffer reconcilement to my love ;
177 Downwards must needs consume , so let our love ;
As having lost his honey , the sweet taste Runs into savour , and will needs retain A spice of his first parents , till , like life , It sees and dies ; so let our love ; and lastly , As when the flame is suffer 'd to look up , It keeps his lustre : but , being thus turn 'd down , ( His natural course of useful light in verted ) , His own stuff puts it out ; so let our love : Now turn from me , as here I turn from thee , And may both points of heaven 's straight axletreeConjoin in one , before thyself and me .


WITH many hands you have seen D'Ambois slain , Yet by your grace he may revive again , And every day grow stronger in his skillTo please , as we presume he is in will .
The best deserving actors of the time Had their ascents ; and by degrees did climb To their full height , a place to study due To make him tread in their path lies in you ;
He 'll not forget his makers ; but still prove His thankfulness as you increase your love .
