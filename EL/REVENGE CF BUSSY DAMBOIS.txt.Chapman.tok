To what will this declining kingdom turn , Swindging in every licence , as in this Stupid permission of brave D'Ambois ' murther ?
Murther made parallel with law ! Murther used To serve the kingdom , given by suit to men For their advancement ! suffer 'd scarecrow- like To fright adultery ! What will policyAt length bring under his capacity ?
All things : for as when the high births of kings , Deliverances , and coronations , We celebrate with all the cities ' bells( Jangling together in untuned confusion ) ;
All order 'd clocks are tied up : so when glory , Flattery , and smooth applauses of things ill , Uphold th'inordinateswindge of downright power , Justice , and truth , that tell the bounded use , Virtuous , and well-distinguish 'd forms of Time Are gagg 'd and tongue-tied , but we have observed Rule in more regular motion : things most lawful Were once most royal , kings sought com- mon good , Men 's manly liberties , though ne 'er so mean , And had their own swindge so : more free , and more .
But when pride enter 'd them , and rule by power , All brows that smiled beneath them , frown 'd : hearts grieved By imitation ; virtue quite was vanish 'd , And all men studied self-love , fraud , and vice ;
Then no man could be good but he was punish 'd : Tyrants being still more fearful of the good Than of the bad ; their subjects ' virtues ever Managed with curbs and dangers , and esteem 'd As shadows and detractions to their own .
Now all is peace , no danger : now what follows ?
Idleness rusts us ; since no virtuous labour Ends ought rewarded : ease , security , Now all the palm wears , we made war be- fore So to prevent war , men with giving gifts More than receiving , made our country strong ;
Our matchless race of soldiers then would spend In public wars , not private brawls , their spirits , In daring enemies , arm 'd with meanest arms ;
Not courting strumpets , and consuming birthrights In apishness and envy of attire .
No labour then was harsh , no way so deep , N2 i8o
Ambition then , was only scaling walls ;
And over-topping turrets ; fame was wealth ;
Best parts , best deeds , were best nobility ;
Honour with worth ; and wealth well got or none : Countries we won with as few men as countries :"Virtue subdued all .
Just : and then our nobles Loved virtue so , they praised and used it too : Had rather do , than say ; their own deeds hearing By others glorified , than be so barren , That their parts only stood in praising Others .
Who could not do , yet praised , and envied not ;
Civil behaviour flourish 'd ; bounty flow 'd , Avarice to upland boors , slaves , hangmen , banish ' d .
' Tis now quite otherwise ; but to note the cause Of all these foul digressions and revolts From our first natures , this 'tis in a word : Since good arts fail , crafts and deceits are used ;
Men ignorant are idle ; idle men Most practise what they most may do with ease , Fashion , and favour ; all their studies aiming At getting money , which no wise man everFed his desires with .
Yet now none are wise That think not heaven 's true foolish , v,-cigh 'd with that .
Well , tTiou most worthy to be greatest Guise , Make with thy greatness a new world arise .
Such depress 'd nobles , followers of his , As you , myself , my lord , will find a timeWhen to revenge your wrongs .
1 make no doubt ;
Pn mean time , I could wish the wrong were righted Of your slain brother-in-law , brave Bussy D'Ambois .
That one accident was made my charge .
My brother Bussy 's sister , now my wife , By no suit would consent to satisfy My love of her with marriage , till I vow 'd , To use my utmost to revenge my brother ;
But Clermoiit D'Ambois , Bussy 's second brother , Had since his apparition , and excitement To suffer none but his hand in his wreak , Which he hath vow 'd , and so will needs acquit Me of my vow , made to my wife , his sister , And undertake himself Bussy 's revenge ;
Yet loathing any way to give it act , But in the noblest and most manly course ;
If th'earl dares take it , he resolves to send A challenge to him , and myself must bear it , To which delivery 1 Can use no means ;
He is so barricado 'd in his house, And arm 'd with guard still .
That means lay on me , Which I can strangely make . My last lands ' sale , By his great suit , stands now on price with him , And he , as you know , passing covetous , With that blind greediness that follows gain , Will cast no danger , where her sweet feet tread .
Besides , you know , his lady by his suit , ( Wooing as freshly , as when first love shot His faultless arrows from her rosy eyes ) Now lives with him again , and she , I know , Will join with all helps in her friend 's revenge .
No doubt , my lord , and therefore let me pray you To use all speed ; for so on needles ' points My wife 's heart stands with haste of the revenge ;
Being , as you know , full of her brother 's fire , That she imagines I neglect my vow ;
Keeps off her kind embraces , and still asks ;
" When , when , will this revenge come ?
when perform 'd Will this dull vow be ? " and I vow to Heaven So sternly , and so past her sex she urges My vow 's performance ; that I almost fear To see her , when I have awhile been ab - sent , Not showing her before I speak , the blood She so much thirsts for , freckling hands and face .
All restitution to your worthiest lordship , Whose errand I must carry to the king , As having sworn my service in the search Of all such malcontents and their designs , By seeming one affected with their faction , And discontented humours 'gainst the state : Nor doth my brother Clermont 'scape my counsel Given to the King , about his Guisean greatness , Which as I spice it , hath possess 'd the King ( Knowing his daring spirit ) of much dan ger Charged in it to his person ; though my conscience Dare s\ \ are him clear of any power to be Infected with the least dishonesty : Yet that sincerity , we politicians Must say , grows out of envy , since it can not Aspire to policy 's greatness : and the more We work on all respects of kind and vir tue , The more our service to the King seems great , In sparing no good that seems bad to him : And the more bad we make the most of good , The more our policy searcheth ; and our service Is wonder 'd at for wisdom and sincereness .
Tis easy to make good suspected still , Where good and God are made but cloaksfor ill .
See Monsieur taking now his leave forBrabant ;
The Guise , and his dear minion , Clermont D'Ambois , Whispering together , not of state affairs I durst lay wagers ( though the Guise be now In chief heat of his faction ) but of some- thing Savouring of that which all men else de- spise , How to be truly noble , truly wise .
See how he hangs upon the ear of Guise, Like to his jewel .
He 's now whispering in Some doctrine of stability , and freedom , Contempt of outward greatness , and the guises That vulgar great ones make their pride and zeal , Being only servile trains , and sumptuous houses , High places , offices .
Contempt of these Does he read to the Guise ? ' Tis passing needful .
And he , I think , makes show t 'affect his doctrine .
Commends , admires it .
And pursues another .
Tis fine hypocrisy , and cheap , and vulgar , Known for a covert practice , yet believed , By those abused souls , that they teach and govern , No more than wives ' adulteries , by their husbands , They bearing it with so unmoved aspects , Hot coming from it , as 'twere not at all , Or made by custom nothing . This same D'Ambois Hath gotten such opinion of his virtues , Holding all learning but an art to live well , And showing he hath learn 'd it , in his life , Being thereby strong in his persuading others ;
That this ambitious Guise , embracing him , Is thought t 'embrace his virtues .
Yet in some His virtues are held false for th'others vices : For 'tis more cunning held , and much more common , To suspect truth than falsehood : and of both Truth still fares worse ; as hardly being believed , As 'tis unusual , and rarely known .
I 'll part engendering virtue . Men affirm Though this same Clermont hath a D'Ambois ' spirit , And breathes his brother 's valour ; yet his temper Is so much past his , that you cannot move him : I 'll try that temper in him . Come , you two Devour each other with your virtue 's zeal , 182
What do men think of me , I pray thee , Clermont ?
Once give me leave ( for trial of that love That from thy brother Bussy thou in- herit 'st ) T'unclasp thy bosom .
As how , sir ?
Be a true glass to me , in which I may Behold what thoughts the many-headed beast , And thou thyself breathes out concerning me , My ends , and new-upstarted state in Brabant , For which I now am bound , my higher aims , Imagined here in France : speak , man , and let Thy words be born as naked as thy thoughts : Oh , were brave Bussy living !
Living , my lord ?
' Tis true thou art his brother , but durst thou Hive braved the Guise , maugre his pre - sence , courted His wedded lady , emptied even the dregs Of his worst thoughts of me , even to my teeth ;
Discer n 'd not me , his rising sovereign , From any common groom , but let me hear My grossest faults , as gross-full as they were .
Durst thou do this ?
I cannot tell : a man Does never know the goodness of his stomach Till he sees meat before him . Were I dared , Perhaps , as he was , I durst do like him .
Dare then to pour out here thy freest soulOf what I am .
' Tis stale ; he told you it .
He only jested , spake of spleen and envy ;
Thy soul , more learn 'd , is more ingenuous , Searching , judicial ; let me then from theeHear what I am .
CL What but the sole support , And most expectant hope of all our France , The toward victor of the whole Low Countries ?
Tush , thou wilt sing encomions of my praise .
Is this like D'Ambois ? I must vex the Guise , Or never look to hear free truth ; tell me , For Bussy lives not ; he durst anger me , Yet for my love , would not have fear 'd to anger The King himself . Thou understand 'st me , dost not ?
I shall , my lord , with study .
Dost understand thyself ? I pray thee tell me , Dost never search thy thoughts , what my design Might be to entertain thee and thy brother ?
What turn I meant to serve with you ?
Even what you please to think .
But what think 'st thou ?
Had I no end in't , think 'st ?
I think you had .
When I took in such two as you two were , A ragged couple of decay 'd commanders , When a French crown would plentifully serve To buy you both to anything i'th ' earth .
So it would you .
Nay , bought you both outright ;
You , and your trunks : I fear me , I offend thee .
No, not a jot .
The most renowned soldier , Epaminondas , as good authors say , Had no more suits than backs , but you two shared But one suit 'twixt you both , when both your studies Were not what meat to dine with ; if your partridge , Your snipe , your wood-cock , lark , or your red-herring , But where to beg it ; whether at my house Or at the Guise 's ( for you know you were Ambitious beggars ) , or at some cook 's - shop , T'eternize the cook 's trust , and score it up .
Dost not offend thee ?
CL No, sir ; pray proceed .
As for thy gentry , I dare boldly take Thy honourable oath ; and yet some say Thou and thy most renowned noble brother,Came to the Court first in a keel of sea-coal ;
Dost not offend thee ?
CL Never doubt it , sir .
183 Out of the dunghill ? cast my cast wardrobe on thee ?
Brought thee to Court too , as I did thybrother ?
Made ye my saucy boon companions ?
Taught ye to call our greatest noblemen By the corruption of their names ; Jack, Tom ?
Have I blown both for .nothing to thisbubble ?
Though thou art learn 'd , th'ast no en- chanting wit , Or were thy wit good , am I therefore bound To keep thee for my table ? Well , sir , 'twere A good knight 's place . Many a proud dubb 'd gallant Seeks out a poor knight 's living from suchemrods .
Or what use else should I design thee to ?
Perhaps you 'll answer me , to be my finder .
Perhaps I shall .
Or did the sly Guise put theeInto my bosom , t 'undermine my projects ?
I fear thee not ; for though I be not sure I have thy heart , I know thy brain-pan yet To be as empty a dull piece of wainscotAs ever arm 'd the scalp of any courtier ;
A fellow only that consists of sinews : Mere Swisser , apt for any execution , Cl . But killing of the King .
Right ; now I seeThou understand 'st thyself .
Ay , and you better :You are a king 's son born .
Right .
And a king 's brother .
True .
And might not any fool have been so too , As well as you ?
A pox upon you !
You did no princely deedsEre you were born , I take it , to deserve it ;
Nor did you any since that I have heard ;
Nor will do ever any , as all think .
The devil take him ! I 'll no moreof him .
Nay : stay , my lord , and hear himanswer you .
No more , I swear . Farewell .
\Exeunt Monsieur , Espernon , Soisson .
No more ! Ill fortune .
I would have given a million to have heard His scoffs retorted , and the insolence Of his high birth and greatness ( which were never Effects of his deserts , but cf his fortune ) Made show to his dull eyes , beneath the worth That men aspire to by their knowing virtues , Without which greatness is a shade , a bubble .
But what one great man dreams of that , but you ?
All take their birth and birth-rights left to them ( Acquired by others ) for their own worth 's purchase , When many a fool in both , is great as they : And who would think they could win with their worths Wealthy possessions , when won to their hands , They neither can judge justly of their value Nor know their use ; and therefore they are puft 'd With such proud tumours as this Monsieur is : Enabled only by the goods they have , To scorn all goodness : none great , fill their fortunes , But as those men that make their houses greater , Their households being less* , so fortune raises Huge heaps of outside in these mighty men, And gives them nothing in them .
True as truth : And therefore they had rather drown their substance In superfluities of bricks and stones ( Like Sysiphus , advancing of them ever , And ever pulling down ) ; than lay the cost Of any sluttish corner , on a man , Built with God 's finger , and enstyled his Temple .
Tis nobly said , my lord .
I would have these things Brought upon stages , to let mighty misers See all their grave and serious miseries play 'd , As once they were in Athens and old Rome .
Nay , we must now have nothing brought on stages , But puppetry , and pied ridiculous antics ;
Men thither come to laugh , and feed fool- fat , Check at all goodness there , as being profaned : When wheresoever goodness comes she makes The place still sacred , though with other feet i8 4
Let me learn anything that fits a man, In any stables shown , as well as stages .
Why ? is not all the world esteem 'd a stage ?
Yes , and right worthily ; and stages too Have a respect due to them , if but only , For what the good Greek moralist says of them : " Is a man proud of greatness , or of riches ?
Give me an expert actor , I 'll show allThat can within his greatest glory fall .
Is a man fray 'd with poverty and lowness ?
Give me an actor , I 'll show every eye What he laments so , and so much doth fly , The best and worst of both . " If but for this then , To make the proudest outside that most swells With things without him , and above his worth , See how small cause he has to be so blown up ;
And the most poor man to be grieved with poorness , Both being so easily borne by expert actors .
The stage and actors are not so contemptful As every innovating puritan , And ignorant sweater out of zealous envy Would have the world imagine . And besides , That all things have been liken 'd to the mirth Used upon stages , and for stages fitted .
The splenative philosopher that ever Laugh 'd at them all , were worthy the enstaging ;
All objects , were they ne 'er so full of tears , He so conceited , that he could distil thenceMatter that still fed his ridiculous humour .
Heard he a lawyer , ne 'er so vehement pleading He stood and laugh 'd . Heard he a trades - man swearing Never so thriftily , selling of his wares , He stood and laugh 'd . Heard he an holy brother , For hollow ostentation at his prayers Ne 'er so impetuously , he stood and laugh 'd .
Saw he a great man never so insulting , Severely inflicting , gravely giving laws , Not for their good , but his , he stood and laugh 'd .
Saw he a youthful widow Never so weeping , wringing of her hands , For her lost lord , still the philosopher laugh 'd .
Now whether he supposed all these presentments Were only maskeries , and wore false faces , Or else were simply vain , I take no care ;
But still he laugh 'd , how grave soe 'er they were .
And might right well , my Clermont ;
and for this Virtuous digression , we will thank the scoffs Of vicious Monsieur . But now for the main point Of your late resolution for revengeOf your slain brother .
I have here my challenge , Which I will pray my brother BalignyTo bear the murtherous earl .
I have prepared Means for access to him , through all his guard .
About it then , my worthy Baligny , And bring us the success .
Tamyra sola .
Revenge , that ever red sitt 'st in the eyes Of injured ladies , till we crown thy brows With bloody laurel , and receive from theeJustice for all our honour 's injury ;
Whose wings none fly , that wrath or tyranny Hath ruthless made , and bloody ; enter here , Enter , O enter ; and , though length of time Never lets any 'scape thy constant justice , Yet now prevent that length . Fly , fly , and here Fix thy steel footsteps : Here , O here , where still Earth , moved with pity , yielded and em - braced My love 's fair figure , drawn in his dear blood , And mark 'd the place , to show thee where was done The cruell 'st murder that e 'er fled the sun .
O earth ! why keep'st thou not as well his spirit , To give his form life ? No, that was not earthly ;
That ( rarefying the thin and yielding air)Flew sparkling up into the sphere of fire .
Whence endless flames it sheds in my desire ;
Still on this haunt ? Still shall adulterous blood Affect thy spirits ? Think , for shame , but this , This blood that cockatrice-like thus thou brood 'st Too dry is to breed any quench to thine .
And therefore now ( if only for thy lust A little cover 'd with a veil of shame ) Look out for fresh life , rather than witch like , Learn to kiss horror , and with death engender .
Strange cross in nature , purest virgin shame Lies in the blood , as lust lies ; and to - gether Many times mix too ; and in none more shameful Than in the shamefaced . Who can then distinguish ' Twixt their affections ; or tell when he meets With one not common ? Yet , as worthiest poets Shun common and plebeian forms of speech ;
Every illiberal and affected phrase To clothe their matter ; and together tieMatter and form , with art and decency ;
So worthiest women should .shun vulgar guises , And though they cannot but fly out for change , Yet modesty , the matter of their lives , Be it adulterate , should be painted true With modest out-parts ; what they should do stili , Graced with good show , though deeds be ne 'er so ill .
That is so far from all ye seek of us , That , though yourselves be common as the air , We must not take the air , we must not fit Our actions to our own affections : But as geometricians , you still say , Teach that no lines nor superficies Do move themselves , but still accompany The motions of their bodies ; so poor wives Must not pursue , nor have their own affections ;
' But to their husbands ' earnests , and their jests , To their austerities of looks , and laughters , .
Though ne 'er so foolish and injurious , Like parasites and slaves , fit their dis - ' posures .
I used thee as my soul , to move and rule me .
So said you , when you woo 'd . So soldiers tortured With tedious sieges of some well-wall 'd town Propound conditions of most large con- tents , Freedom of laws , all former government ;
But having once set foot within the walls , And got the reins of power into theirhands ;
Then do they tyrannize at their own rude swindges , Seize all their goods , their liberties , and lives , And make advantage and their lusts their laws .
But love me , and perform a wife 's part yet , ( With all my love before ) I swear forgiveness .
Forgiveness ! that grace you shouldseek of me ;
These tortured fingers and these stabb 'd - through arms Keep that law in their wounds , yet , unob - served , And ever shall .
Remember their deserts .
Those with fair warnings might have been reform 'd , Not these unmanly rages . You have heard The fiction of the north-wind and the sun , Both working on a traveller , and con- tending Which had most power to take his cloakfrom him ;
Which when the wind attempted , he roar 'd out Outrageous blasts at him to force it off , That wrapt it closer on . When the calm sun ( The wind once leaving ) charged him with still beams Quiet and fervent , and therein was con- stant , Which made him cast off both his cloakand coat ;
Like whom should men do . If ye wish your wives Should leave disliked things , seek it not with rage , For that enrages ; what ye give , ye have ;
i86
My lord .
How now ? would any speak with me ?
Ay , sir .
Perverse and traitorous mis - creant , Where are your other fellows of my guard ?
Have 1^ not told you , I will speak with none But Lord Renel ?
And 'tis he that stays you .
O , is it he ? Tis well ; attend him in : I must be vigilant ; the furies haunt me .
Do you hear , dame ?
Be true now , for your lady 's injured sake , Whose bounty you have so much cause to honour ;
For her respect is chief in this design , And therefore serve it ; call out of the way All your confederate fellows of his guard,Till Monsieur Baligny be enter 'd here .
Upon your honour , my lord shall be free From any hurt , you say ?
Free as myself . Watch then , and cleat his entry .
I will not fail , my lord .

My noblest Lord Renel ! past all men welcome : Wife , welcome his lordship . \Osculatur .
I much joy in your return here .
You do more than I.
She 's passionate still , to think we ever parted , By my too stern injurious jealousy .
Tis well your lordship will confess your errorIn so good time yet .
Death ! Who have we here ?
Ho ! guard ! villains !
Why exclaim you so ?
Negligent traitors ! Murther ,murther , murther !
Y'are mad . Had mine intent been so like yours ,It had been done ere this .
Sir , your intent, And action too , was rude to enter thus .
Y'are a decay d lord to tell me of rudeness , As much decay 'd in manners as in means .
You talk of manners , that thus rudely thrust Upon a man that 's busy with his wife .
And kept your lordship then the door ?
The door ?
Sweet lord , forbear . Show , show your purpose , sir , To move such bold feet into others ' roofs .
This is my purpose , sir ; from Cler- mont D'Ambois I bring this challenge .
Challenge ! I 'll touch none .
I 'll leave it here then .
Thou shalt leave thy life first .
Murther , murther !
Retire , my lord ; get off .
Hold , or thy death shall hold thee . Hence , my lord .
There lie the challenge .

Was not this well handled ?
Nobly , my lord . All thanks .

Henry , Baligny .
Come , Baligny , we now are private : say , What service bring 'st thou ? make it short ;
the Guise ,
Court , and near, And may observe us .
187 Grows ripe , and must be gather 'd into hold ;
Of which my brother Clermont being a part Exceeding capital , deserves to have A capital eye on him . And as you may With best advantage , and your speediest charge , Command his apprehension ; which ( be- cause The Court , you know , is strong in his defence ) We must ask country swindge and open fields .
And , therefore , I have wrought him to go down To Cambray with me ( of which govern ment Your highness ' bounty made me your Lieutenant ) Where , when I have him , I will leave my house , And feign some service out about the confines , When in the meantime , if you please to give Command to my Lieutenant , by your letters , To train him to some muster , where he may , Much to his honour , see for him , your forces Put into battail ; when he comes , he may With some close stratagem be apprehended .
For otherwise your whole powers there will fail To work his apprension : and with thatMy hand needs never be discer n 'd therein .
Thanks , honest Baligny .
Your highness knows I will be honest ; and betray for you Brother and father : for , I know , my lord, Treachery for kings is truest loyalty ;
Nor is to bear the name of treachery , But grave , deep policy . All acts thatseem 111 in particular respects , are goodAs they respect your universal rule .
As in the main sway of the universe The supreme Rector 's general decrees , To guard the mighty globes of earth and heaven , Since they make good that guard to preser- vation .Of both those in their order and first end , No man 's particular ( as he thinks ) wrong Must hold him wrong 'd ; no , not though all men 's reasons , All law , all conscience , concludes it wrong .
Nor is comparison a flattererTo liken you here to the King of kings ;
Nor any man 's particular offence Against the world 's sway , to offence at yours In any subject ; who as little may Grudge their particular wrong , if so it seem For th'universal right of your estate .
As ( being a subject of the world 's whole sway As well as yours ; and being a righteous man To whom Heaven promises defence , and blessing , Brought to decay , disgrace , and quite defenceless ) He may complain of Heaven for wrong to him .
' Tis true : the simile at all parts holds , As all good subjects hold , that love our favour .
Which is our heaven here ; and a misery Incomparable , and most truly hellish , To live deprived of our king 's grace and countenance , Without which best conditions are most cursed : Life of that nature , howsoever short , Is a most lingering and tedious life ;
Or rather no life , but a languishing , And an abuse of life .
' Tis well conceited .
I thought it not amiss to yield your highness A reason of my speeches ; lest perhaps You might conceive I flatter 'd ; which , I know , Of all ills under heaven you most abhor .
Your majesty fare ever like itself .
My sure friend , Baligny !
Noblest of princes !
How stands the State of Cambray ?
Strong , my lord , And fit for service : for whose readiness Your creature Clermont D'Ambois , and myselfRide shortly down .
i88
France never bred a nobler gentlemanFor all parts ; he exceeds his brother Bussy .
Ay , my lord ?
Far ; because , besides his valour , He hath the crown of man , and all his parts , Which learning is : and that so true and virtuous , That it gives power to do as well as sayWhatever fits a most accomplish 'd man ;
Which Bussy , for his valour 's season , lack 'd ;
And so was rapt with outrage oftentimes Beyond decorum ; where this absolute Clermont , Though , only for his natural zeal to right , He will be fiery , when he sees it cross 'd , And in defence of it ; yet when he listsHe can contain that fire , as hid in embers .
No question , he 's a true , learn 'd gentleman .
He is as true as tides , or any star Is in his motion ; and for his rare learning , He is not , as all else are that seek know - ledge , Of taste so much depraved , that they had rather Delight , and satisfy themselves to drink Of the stream troubled , wandering ne 'er so far From the clear fount , than of the fount itself .
In all , Rome 's Brutus is revived in him , Whom he of industry doth imitate : Or rather , as great Troy 's Euphorbus wasAfter Pythagoras ; so is Brutus , Clermont .
And , were not Brutus a conspirator Ba . Conspirator , my lord ? Doth that impair him ?
Caesar began to tyrannize ; and when virtue Nor the religion of the gods could serve To curb the insolence of his proud laws ,Brutus would be the gods ' just instrument .
What said the princess , sweet Antigone , In the grave Greek tragedian , when the question ' Twixt her and Creon is , for laws of kings ?
Which , when he urges , she replies on him ;
Though his laws were a king 's , they were not God 's ;
Nor would she value Creon 's written laws With God 's unwrit edicts ; since they last not This day , and next , but every day and ever ;
Where kings ' laws alter every day and hour , And in that change imply a bounded power .
Well , let us leave these vain dis - putings what Is to be done , and fall to doing something .
When are you for your government in Cambray ?
When you command , my lord .
Nay , that 's not fit .
Continue your designments with the King , With all your sen-ice ; only if I send Respect me as your friend , and love my Clermont .
Your highness knows my vows .
Ay , 'tis enough .
{Exit Guise . Manet Baligny .
Thus , must we play on both sides , and thus hearten In any ill those men whose good we hate .
Kings may do what they list ; and for kings , subjects , Either exempt from censure or exception ;
For , as no man 's worth can be justly judgedBut when he shines in some authority ;
So no authority should suffer censure
Great vessels into less are emptied never , There 's a redundance past their continent ever .
These virtuosi are the poorest creatures ;
For look how spinners weave out of them - selves Webs , whose strange matter none before can see ;
So these , out of an unseen good in virtue , Make arguments of right , and comfort in her , That clothe them like the poor web of a spinner .
Now , to my challenge . What 's the place , the weapon ?
Soft , sir ; let first your challenge be received ; vHe would not touch , nor see it .
Possible !
How did you then ?
Left it in his despite , But when he saw me enter so expectless , To hear his base exclaims of murther , L murther , Made me think noblesse lost , in him quick 'buried .
fie iravTos , &amp;c . Impossible est viri cognoscere mentem ac voluntatem , priusquam in Magistratibus apparet .
Antig . !
189 Cl . They are the breathing sepulchres of noblesse ;
No trulier noble men , than lion 's pictures Hung up for signs , are lions . Who knows not , That lions the more soft kept , are more
And look how lions close kept , fed by hand , Lose quite th'innative fire of spirit and greatness That lions free breathe , foraging for prey , And grow so gross , that mastiffs , curs , and mongrels Have spirit to cow them . So our soft French nobles Chain 'd up in ease and numb 'd security , Their spirits shrunk up like their covetous fists , And never open 'd but Domitian-like , And all his base obsequious minions When they were catching , though it were but flies .
Besotted with their peasants ' love of gain , Rusting at home and on each other preying , Are for their greatness but the greater slaves , And none is noble but who scrapes and saves .
' Tis base , 'tis base ! and yet they think them high .
So children mounted on their hobby- horse Think they are riding , when with wanton toil They bear what should bear them . A man may well Compare them to those foolish great- spleen 'd camels , That to their high heads , begg 'd of Jove horns higher ;
Whose most uncomely and ridiculous pride When he had satisfied , they could not use , But where they went upright before , they stoop 'd , And bore their heads much lower for their horns .
As these high men do , low in all true grace , Their height being privilege to all things base .
And as the foolish poet that still writ All his most self-loved verse in paper royal , Of parchment ruled with lead , smoothed with the pumice , Bound richly up , and strung with crimson strings ;
Never so blest as when he writ and read
The ape-loved issue of his brain , and never But joying in himself , admiring ever : Yet in his works behold him , and he show 'd Like to a ditcher . So these painted men , All set on out-side , look upon within , And not a peasant 's entrails you shall find More foul and measled , nor more sterved of mind .
That makes their bodies fat . I fain would know How many millions of our other nobles Would make one Guise . There is a true tenth worthy , Who ( did not one act only blemish him)CL One act ? what one ?
One , that , though years past done , Sticks by him still and will distain him ever .
Good heaven ! wherein ? what one act can you name Supposed his stain , that I 'll not prove his lustre ?
To satisfy you , 'twas the massacre .
The massacre ? I thought 'twas some such blemish .
Oh , it was heinous !
To a brutish sense , But not a manly reason . We so tender The vile part in us , that the part divine We see in hell , and shrink not . Who was first Head of that massacre ?
The Guise .
Tis nothing so .
Who was in fault for all the slaughters made In Ilipn , and about it ? were the Greeks ?
Was it not Paris ravishing the Queen Of Lacaedemon ? Breach of shame and faith ?
And all the laws of hospitality ?
This is the beastly slaughter made of men , When truth is overthrown , his laws corrupted ;
When souls are smother 'd in the flatter 'd flesh , Slain bodies are no more than oxen slain .
Differ not men from oxen ?
Who says so ?
But see wherein ; in the understanding rules Of their opinions , lives , and actions ;
In their communities of faith and reason .
Was not the wolf that nourish 'd Romulus More humane than the men that did expose him ?
That makes against you .
Not , sir , if you note
' Twixt men and beasts , and not their names nor forms .
Had faith , nor shame , all hospitable rights Been broke by Troy , Greece had not made that slaughter .
Had that been saved ( says a philosopher) The Iliads and Odysseys had been lost ;
Had Faith and true Religion been preferr 'd , Religious Guise had never massacred .
Well , sir , I cannot when I meet with you But thus digress a little , for my learning , From any other business I intend .
But now the voyage we resolved for Cam - bray I told the Guise begins , and we must haste .
And till the Lord Renel hath found some mean Conspiring with the countess , to make sure Your sworn wreak on her husband , though this fail 'd , In my so brave command , we 'll spend the time , Sometimes in training out in skirmishesAnd battles , all our troops and companies ;
And sometimes breathe your brave Scotch - running horse , That great Guise gave you , that all th " horse in France Far overruns at every race and hunting Both of the hare and deer . You shall be honour 'd Like the great Guise himself , above the King .
And ( can you but appease your great- spleen 'd sister For our delay 'd wreak of your brother 's slaughter ) At all parts you 'll be welcomed to your wonder .
I 'll see my lord the Guise again beforeWe take our journey .
O , sir , by all means ;
You cannot be too careful of his love , That ever takes occasion to be raising Your virtues past the reaches of this age , And ranks you with the best of th'ancient Romans .
That praise at no part moves me , but the worthOf all he can give others sphered in him .

very slight alteration would suffice to make thesense clear . Eo .
He yet is thought to entertain strange aims .
He may be well , yet not as you think strange .
His strange aims are to cross the common .
custom Of servile nobles , in which he 's so ravish 'd , That quite the earth he leaves , and up he leaps On Atlas ' shoulders , and from thence looks down , Viewing how far off other high ones creep : Rich , poor of reason , wander ; all pale looking , And trembling but to think of their sure deaths , Their lives so base are , and so rank their breaths .
I teach Guise to heighten , and make sweet With life 's dear odours , a good mind and name ;
For which he only loves me , and deserves My love and life , which through all deaths I vow : Resolving this , whatever change can be, Thou hast created , thou hast ruin 'd me .

A march of Captains over the stage . Mail- lard , Chalon , Aumale following withSoldiers .
These troops and companies come in with wings : So many men , so arm 'd , so gallant horse , I think no other government in France So soon could bring together . With such men Methinks a man might pass th'insulting pillars Of Bacchus and Alcides .
I much wonder Our lord-lieutenant brought his brother down To feast and honour him , and yet now leaves himAt such an instance .
' Twas the King 's command : For whom he must leave brother , wife , friend , all things .
We must not argue that . The King 's command Is need and right enough : and that he serves , ( As all true subjects should ) without disputing .
But knows not he of your com- mand to takeHis brother Clermont ?
No : the King 's will is Expressly to conceal his apprehensionFrom my lord governor . Observed ye not ?
Again peruse the letters . Both you are Made my assistants , and have right and trust In all the weighty secrets like myself .
Tis strange a man that had , through his life past , So sure a foot in virtue and true know - ledge , As Clermont D'Ambois , should be now found tripping , And taken up thus , so to make his fallMore steep and headlong .
It is Virtue 's fortune, To keep her low , and in her proper place ;
Height hath no room for her . But as a man That hath a fruitful wife , and every year A child by her , hath every year a month To breathe himself : where he that gets no child Hath not a night 's rest , if he will do well : So , let one marry this same barren Virtue , She never lets him rest : where fruitful Vice Spares her rich drudge , gives him in labour breath ;
Feeds him with bane , and makes him fat with death .
I see that good lives never can secure Men from bad livers . Worst men will have best As ill as they , or heaven to hell they 'll wrest .
There was a merit for this , in the fault That Bussy made , for which he , doing penance , Proves that these foul adulterous guilts will run Through the whole blood , which not the clear can shun .
I 'll therefore take heed of the bas - tarding Whole innocent races ; 'tis a fearful thing .
And as I am true bachelor , I swear , To touch no woman , to the coupling ends , Unless it be mine own wife , or my friend 's .
I may make bold with him .
' Tis safe and common .
The more your friend dares trust , the more deceive him .
And as , through dewy vapours , the sun 's form Makes the gay rainbow girdle to a storm , So in hearts hollow , friendship ( even the sun To all good growing in society ) Makes his so glorious and divine name hold Colours for all the ill that can be told .
Hark , our last troops are come .

Come , let us put all quickly into battail , And send for Clermont , in whose honour all This martial preparation we pretend .
We must bethink us , ere we apprehend him , ( Besides our main strength ) , of some stratagem To make good our severe command on him , As well to save blood , as to make him sure : For if he come on his Scotch horse , all France Put at the heels of him , will fail to take him .
What think you , if we should disguise a brace Of our best soldiers in fair lackeys ' coats , And send them for him , running by his side , Till they have brought him in some ambus - cado We close may lodge for him , and suddenly Lay sure hand on him , plucking him from horse .
It . must be sure and strong hand ;
for if once He feels the touch of such a stratagem , Tis not the choicest brace of all our bandsCan manacle or quench his fiery hands .
When they have seized him , the ambush shall make in .
Do as you please ; his blameless spirit deserves , I dare engage my life , of all this , nothing .
Why should all this stir be , then ?
Who knows not The bombast polity thrust into his giant , To make his wisdom seem of size as huge , And all for slight encounter of a shade , 192
It may be once so , but so ever , never : Ambition is abroad , on foot , on horse ;
Faction chokes every corner , street , the Court ;
Whose faction 'tis you know , and who is held The fautor 's right hand ; how high his aims reach Nought but a crown can measure . This must fall Past shadows ' weights , and is most capital .
Ch , No question ; for since he is come to Cambray , The malcontent , decay 'd Marquis Renel Is come , and new arrived , and made par- taker Of all the entertaining shows and feasts That welcomed Clennont to the brave virago , His manly sister . Such we are esteem 'd As are our consorts . Marquess Malcontent Comes where he knows his vein hath safest vent .
Let him come at his will , and go as free ;
Let us ply Clermont , our whole charge is he . \Exit .
This for your lordship 's welcome into Cambray .
Noblest of ladies , 'tis beyond all power , Were my estate at first full , in my meansTo quit or merit .
You come something later From Court , my lord , than I ; and since news there Is every day increasing with th "affairs , Must I not ask now , what the news is there ?
Where the Court lies ? what stir ? change ?
what avise From England ? Italy ?
You must do so , If you 'll be call 'd a gentleman well quali fied , \ And wear your time and wits in those discourses .
The Locrian Princes therefore were brave rulers ;
For whosoever there came new from country And in the city ask 'd , what news ? waspunish 'd ;
Since commonly such brains are most delighted With innovations , gossips ' tales , and mischiefs ;
But as of lions it is said and eagles , That when they go , they draw their seres and talons Close up , to shun rebating of their sharpness ;
So our wit 's sharpness , which we should employ In noblest knowledge , we should never waste In vile and vulgar admirations .
' Tis right ; but who , save only you , performs it , And your great brother ? Madam , where is he ?
Gone a day since , into the coun- try 's confines , To see their strength , and readiness forservice .
- Re . Tis well ; his favour with the King hath made him Most worthily great , and live right royally .
Ay , would he would not do so !
Honour never Should be esteem 'd with wise men , as the price And value of their virtuous services , But as their sign or badge ; for that be- wrays More glory in the outward grace of good - ness , Than in the good itself ; and then 'tis said : Who more joy takes , that men his good advance , Than in the good itself , does it by chance .
My brother speaks all principle ;
what man Is moved with your soul , or hath such a thought In any rate of goodness ?
Tis their fault : We have examples of it , clear and many .
Demetrius Phalerius , an orator , And ( which not oft meet ) a philosopher , So great in Athens grew , that he erected Three hundred statues of him ; of all which , No rust nor length of time corruptedone ;
But in his life time , all were overthrown .
And Demades ( that pass 'd Demosthenes For all extemporal orations ) Erected many statues , which , he living .
193 Were broke , and melted into chamberpots .
Many such ends have fall 'n on such proud honours , No more because the men on whom they fell Grew insolent and left their virtues ' state ;
Than for their hugeness , that procuredtheir hate ;
And therefore little pomp in men most great , Makes mightily and strongly to the guard Of what they win by chance , or just reward .
Great and immodest braveries again , Like statues , much too high made for their bases , Are overturn 'd as soon as given theirplaces .
Me , Here is a letter , sir , deliver 'd me, Now at the fore-gate by a gentleman .
What gentleman ?
He would not tell his name ;
He said , he had not time enough to tell it , And say the little rest he had to say .
That was a merry saying ; he took measure Of his dear time like a most thrifty husband .
What news ?
CL Strange ones , and fit for a novation ;
Weighty , unheard of , mischievous enough .
Heaven shield ! what are they ?
CL Read them , good my lord .
" You are betrayed into this country . "
Monstrous !
How 's that ?
Read on .
" Maillard , your brother 's lieu- tenant , that yesterday invited you to see his musters , hath letters and strict chargefrom the King to apprehend you . "
To apprehend him ?
" Your brother absents himself ofpurpose . "
CL That 's a sound one .
That 's a lie .
" Get on your Scotch horse , and retire to your strength ; you know where it is , and there it expects you ; believe this as your best friend had sworn it . Fare well , ifyou will . ANONYMOS. " What 's that ?
CL Without a name .
And all his notice too without alltruth .
So I conceive it , sister ; I 'll not wrong My well-known brother for Anonymos .
Some fool hath put this trick on you , yet more T'uncover your defect of spirit and valour , First shown in lingering my dear brother 's wreak .
See what it is to give the envious worldAdvantage to diminish eminent virtue .
Send him a challenge ? Take a noble course To wreak a murther , done so like a villain ?
Shall we revenge a villany withvillany ?
Is it not equal ?
CL Shall we equal be with villains ?
Is that your reason ?
Cowardice evermoreFlies to the shield of reason .
CL Nought that is Approved by reason can be cowardice .
Dispute when you should fight .
Wrong , wreakless sleeping , Makes men die honourless ; one borne , anotherLeaps on our shoulders .
CL We must wreak our wrongsSo as we take not more .
One wreak 'd in time Prevents all other . Then shines virtue most When time is found for facts ; and found , not lost .
CL No time occurs to kings , much less to virtue ;
Nor can we call it virtue that proceeds From vicious fury . I repent that ever ( By any instigation in th 'appearance My brother 's spirit made , as I imagined) That e 'er I yielded to revenge his murther .
All worthy men should ever bring their blood To bear all ill , not to be wreak 'd with good : Do ill for no ill ; never private causeShould take on it the part of public laws .
A D'Ambois bear in wrong so tame a spirit !
Madam , be sure there will be time enough For all the vengeance your great spirit can wish .
The course yet taken is allow 'd by all ,
earl , Now makes him worthy of your worst advantage ;
To watch a time when all his wariest guards Shall not exempt him . Therefore give him breath ;
Sure death delay 'd is a redoubled death .
Good sister , trouble not yourself with this ;
Take other ladies ' care ; practise your face .
There 's the chaste matron , Madam Perigot , Dwells not far hence ; I 'll ride and send her to you .
She did live by retailing maiden-heads In her minority ; but now she dealsIn wholesale altogether for the Court .
I tell you , she 's the only fashion-monger , For your complexion , powdering of your hair , Shadows , rebatoes , wires , tires , and such tricks , That Cambray , or I think , the Court affords ;
She shall attend you , sister , and with these Womanly practices employ your spirit ;
This other suits you not , nor fits the fashion .
Though she be dear , lay 't on , spare for no cost , Ladies in these have all their bounties lost .
Madam , you see his spirit will not check At any single danger ; when it stands Thus merrily firm against a host of men, Threaten 'd to be in arms for his surprise .
That 's a mere bugbear , an impossible mock .
If he , and him I bound by nuptial faith Had not been dull and drossy in per- forming Wreak of the dear blood of my matchless brother , What prince , what king , which of the desperatest ruffians , Outlaws in Arden , durst have tempted thus One of our blood and name , be 't true or false ?
This is not caused by that ; 'twill be as sure As yet it is not , though this should be true .
True ? 'tis past thought false .
I suppose the worst , Which far I am from thinking ; and de- spise The army now in battail that should act it .
I would not let my blood up to that thought , But it should cost the dearest blood in France .

I would once Strip off my shame with my attire , and try If a poor woman , votist of revenge , Would not perform it with a precedentTo all you bungling , foggy-spirited men ;
But for our birthright 's honour , do not mention One syllable of any word may go To the begetting of an act so tenderAnd full of sulphur as this letter 's truth ;
It comprehends so black a circumstance Not to be named , that but to form one thought , It is or can be so , would make me mad ;
Come , my lord , you and I will fight this dream Out at the chess .
Most gladly , worthiest lady .

Sir , my Lord Governor 's Lieutenant praysAccess to you .
Himself alone ?
Alone , sir .

I shall discern , if it be true as rare , Some sparks will fly from his dissembling eyes .
I 'll sound his depth .
Honour , and all things noble !
As much to you , good Captain .
What 's th ' affair ?
Sir , the poor honour we can add to all Your studied welcome to this martial place , In presentation of what strength consistsMy lord , your brother 's government is ready .
I have made all his troops and companies Advance , and put themselves ranged in battalia , That you may see , both how well-arm 'd i they are ;
How strong is every troop and company ;
How ready , and how well prepared for service .
And must they take me ?
Take you , sir ? O , heaven !
Believe it , sir ; his countenance changed in turning .
What do you mean , sir ?
'95 Cl . If you have charged them , You being charged yourself , to apprehend me , Turn not your face ; throw not your looks about so .
Pardon me , sir . You amaze me to conceive From whence our wills to honour you should turn To such dishonour of my lord your brother .
Dare I , without him , undertake your taking ?
Why not ? by your direct charge from the King ?
By my charge from the King ?
would he so much Disgrace my lord , his own lieutenant here , To give me his command without his forfeit ?
Acts that are done by kings are not ask 'd why : I 'll not dispute the case , but I will search you .
Search me ? for what ?
CL For letters .
I beseech you Do not admit one thought of such a shameTo a commander .
Go to ; I must do 't .
Stand and be search 'd ; you know me .
You forget What 'tis to be a captain , and yourself .
Stand ! or I vow to heaven , I 'll make you lie,Never to rise more .
If a man be madReason must bear him .
So coy to be search 'd ?
'Sdeath , sir ! use a captain like a carrier ?
Come , be not furious ; when I have done You shall make such a carrier of me , If t be your pleasure ; you 're my friend , I know , And so am bold with you .
You 'll nothing findWhere nothing is .
Swear you have nothing .
Nothing you seek , I swear , I beseech you ;
Know I desired this out of great affection , To th'end my lord may know out of your witness His forces are not in so bad estate As he esteem 'd them lately in your hearing : For which he would not trust me with the confines ;
But went himself to witness their estate .
I heard him make that reason , and am sorry I had no thought of it before I made Thus bold with you ; since 'tis such rhubarb to you , I 'll therefore search no more . If you are charged By letters from the King , or otherwise , To apprehend me ; never spice it more With forced terms of your love , but stay ; I yield ;
Hold ; take my sword ; here ; I forgive thee freely ;
Take ; do thine office .
'Sfoot , you make me a hangman ;
By all my faith to you , there 's no such thing .
Your faith to me ?
My faith to God ; all 's one , Who hath no faith to men , to God hath none .
In that sense I accept your oath , and thank you : I gave my word to go , and I will go .

If he goes , he proves How vain are men 's foreknowledges of things , When heaven strikes blind their powers of note and use ;
And makes their way to ruin seem more right Than that which safety opens to their sight .
Cassandra 's prophecy had no more profit With Troy 's blind citizens , when she fore- told Troy 's ruin ; which , succeeding , made her use This sacred inclamation : " God " ( said she ) " Would have me utter things uncredited : " For which now they approve what 1 presaged ;
" They count me wise , that said before I raged . "
Give me your pieces , and take you these coats , To make you complete footmen , in whose forms , Youmust be complete soldiers ; youtwoonlyStand for our army .
That were much .
' Tis true , You two must do , or enter , what our armyIs now in field for .
O 2
What fi^ht soldiers most for ?
Honour only .
Yet here are crowns beside .
We thank you , captain .
Now , sir , how show we ?
As you should at all parts .
Go now to Clermont D'Ambois , and inform him Two battails are set ready in his honour , And stay his presence only for their signal , When they shall join : and that t 'attend him hither , Like one we so much honour , we have sent him ist . Us two in person .
Well , sir , say it so .
And having brought him to the field , when I Fall in with him , saluting , get you both Of one side of his horse , and* pluck him down , And I with th'ambush laid , will second you .
Nay , we shall lay on hands of too much strengthTo need your secondings .
I hope we shall .
Two are enough to encounter Hercules .
' Tis well said , worthy soldiers :haste , and haste him .
My Scotch horse to their army .
Please you , sir ?
'Sdeath , you 're passing diligent .
Of my soul ' Tis only in my love to honour you With what would grace the King : but since I see You still sustain a jealous eye on me, I'll go before .
' Tis well ; I 'll come ; my hand .
Your hand , sir ? Come , your word ,your choice be used . \Exit .
Clermont solus .
CL I had an aversation to this voyage , When first my brother moved it ; and have found That native power in me was never vain ;
Yet now neglected it : I wonder much At my inconstancy in these decrees , I every hour set down to guide my life .
When Homer made Achilles passionate , Wrathful , revengeful , and insatiate In his affections ; what man will deny , He did compose it all of industry , To let men see , that men of most renown , Strong 'st , noblest , fairest , if they set not down Decrees within them , for disposing these , Of judgment , resolution , uprightness , And certain knowledge of their use and ends Mishap and misery no less extends To their destruction , with all that they prized , Than to the poorest , and the most despised , Enter Renel .
Why , how now , friend ? retired ?
Take heed you prove not Dismay 'd with this strange fortune ; all observe you : Your government 's as much mark 'd as the King 's .
What said a friend to Pompey ?
What ?
The people Will never know , unless in death thou try , That thou know 'st how to bear adversity .
I shall approve how vile I value fear Of death at all times ; but to be too rash , Without both will and care to shun the worst ( It being in power to do , well and with cheer ) , Is stupid negligence , and worse than fear .
Suppose this true now .
No, I cannot do 't .
My sister truly said , there hung a tail Of circumstance so black on that suppo- sure , That to sustain it thus , abhorr 'd our metal .
And I can shun it , too , in spite of all : Not going to field , and there , too , being so mounted As I will , since I go .
You will then go ?
I am engaged , both in my word and hand ;
But this is it that makes me thus retired , To call myself t 'account how this affair Is to be managed if the worst should chance ;
With which I note , how dangerous it is For any man to prease beyond the place To which his birth , or means , or knowledge ties him ;
For my part , though of noble birth , my birthright Had little left it , and I know 'tis better To live with little , and to keep within |Tc , 197 A man 's own strength still , and in man 's true end , Than run a mix 'd course . Good and bad hold never Anything common ; you can never find Things outward care , but you neglect your mind .
God hath the whole world perfect made , and free , His parts to th'use of th'all ; men then that are Parts of that all , must , as the general sway Of that importeth , willingly obey In everything without their power to change .
He that , unpleased to hold his place , will range , Can in no other be contain 'd that 's fit , And so resisting th ' All , is crush 'd with it .
But he , that knowing how divine a frame The whole world is ; and of it all , can name , Without self-flattery , no part so divine As he himself , and therefore will confine Freely , his whole powers , in his proper part , Goes on most God-like . He that strives t 'invert The Universal 's course with his poor way , Not only dust-like shivers with the sway , But , crossing God in his great work , all earth Bears not so cursed and so damn 'd a birth .
Go on ; I 'll take no care what comes of you ;
Heaven will not see it ill , howe 'er it show : But the pretext to see these battails rangedIs much your honour .
As the world esteems it .
But to decide that , you make me remember An accident of high and noble note , And fits the subject of my late discourseOf holding on our free and proper way .
I overtook , coming from Italy , In Germany , a great and famous earl Of England , the most goodly-fash ion 'd man I ever saw ; from head to foot in form Rare and most absolute ; he had a face Like one of the most ancient honour 'd Romans , From whence his noblest family was derived ;
He was beside of spirit passing great , Valiant , and learn 'd , and liberal as the sun , Spoke and writ sweetly , or of learned subjects , Or of the discipline of public weals ;
And 'twas the Earl of Oxford ; and being offer 'd At that time , by Duke Cassimere , the view Of his right royal army then in field ;
Refused it , and no foot was moved , to stir Out of his own free fore-determined course : I , wondering at it , ask 'd for it his reason ,It being an offer so much for his honour .
He , all acknowledging , said , 'twas not fit To take those honours that one cannot quit .
Twas answer 'd like the man you have described .
CL And yet he cast it only in the way , To stay and serve the world . Nor did it fit His own true estimate how much it weighed , For he despised it ; and esteem 'd it freer To keep his own way straight ; and swore that he Had rather make away his whole estate In things that cross 'd the vulgar , than he would Be frozen up , stiff , like a Sir John Smith , His countryman , in common nobles ' fashions ;
Affecting , as the end of noblesse wereThose servile observations .
It was strange .
O , 'tis a vexing sight to see a manOut of his way , stalk proud as he were in ;
Out of his way to be officious , Observant , wary , serious , and grave , Fearful , and passionate , insulting , raging , Labour with iron flails , to thresh down feathersFlitting in air .
What one considers this , Of all that are thus out ? or once en- deavours , Erring to enter , on man 's right-hand path ?
These are too grave for brave wits ;
give them toys ;
Labour bestow 'd on these is harsh and thriftless .
If you would consul be , says one , of Rome , You must be watching , starting out of sleeps ;
Every way whisking ; glorifying plebeiansKissing patricians ' hands , rot at their doors ;
Speak and do basely ; every day bestowGifts and observance upon one or other ;
And what 's th ' event of all ? Twelve rods before thee ;
Three or four times sit for the whole tribunal ;
I 9 3
And for these idle outward things ( says he ) Would 'st thou lay on such cost , toil , spend thy spirits , And to be void of perturbation For constancy , sleep when thou would 'st have sleep , Wake when thou would 'st wake , fear nought , vex for nought , No pains wilt thou bestow ? no cost ? no thought ?
What should I say ? As good con- sort with you As with an angel ; I could hear you ever .
Well ; in , my lord , and spend time with my sister , And keep her from the field with all endeavour ;
The soldiers love her so , and she so madly Would take my apprehension , if it chance , That blood would flow in rivers .
Heaven forbid ;
And all with honour your arrival speed .

Here are two lackeys , sir , have message to you .
What is your message ; and from whom , my friend ?
From the lieutenant-colonel , and the captains ;
Who sent us to inform you that the battails Stand ready ranged ; expecting but your presence , To be their honour 'd signal when to join , And we are charged to run by , and attend you .
I come . I pray you see my running horse Brought to the back-gate to me .
Chance what can chance me , well or ill is equal In my acceptance , since I joy in neither ;
But go with sway of all the world together .
In all successes , fortune and the day To me alike are ; I am fix 'd , be she Never so fickle ; and will there repose , Far past the reach of any die she throws .

Alarum within ; Excursions over theStage .
The Lackeys running , Maillardfollowing them .
Villains ! not hold him when ye had him down ?
i st . Who can hold lightning ? 'Sdeath , a man as well Might catch a cannon-bullet in his mouth , And spit it in your hands , as take and hold him .
Alarum still , and enter Chalon .
Stand , cowards , stand ; strike , send your bullets at him .
We came to entertain him , sir , for honour .
Did ye not say so ?
Slaves , he is a traitor !
Shouts within . Alarum still , and chambers shot off . Then enter Aumale .
What spirit breathes thus , in this more than man , Turns flesh to air possess 'd , and in a storm , Tears men about the field like autumn leaves ?
He turn 'd wild lightning in the lackeys ' hands , Who , though their sudden violent twitch unhorsed him , Yet when he bore himself , their saucy fingers Flew as too hot off , as he had been fire .
The ambush then made in , through all whose force , He drave as if a fierce and fire-given cannon Had spit his iron vomit out amongst them .
The battails then in two half-moons en- closed him , In which he show 'd as if he were the light , And they but earth , who wondering what he was , Shrunk their steel horns , and gave him glorious pass ;
199 At foes before it , flies forth black and roaring , But they too far , and that with weight oppress 'd , ( As if disdaining earth ) doth only graze ,Strike earth , and up again into the air ;
Again sinks to it , and again doth rise , And keeps such strength that when it softliest mores , It piecemeal shivers any let it proves ;
So flew brave Clermont forth , till breath forsook him , His spirit 's convulsions made him bound again , Past all their reaches ; till all motion spent , j His fix 'd eyes cast a blaze of such dis - dain , i All stood and stared , and untouch 'd let him lie , As something sacred fall 'n out of the sky .

See , prisoner led , with his bands honour 'd moreThan all the freedom he enjoy 'd before .
At length we have you , sir .
You have much joy too ;
1 made you sport yet , but I pray you tell me , Are not you perjured ?
No ; I swore for the King .
Yet perjury I hope is perjury .
But thus forswearing is not perjury ;
You are no politician ; not a fault , How foul soever , done for private ends , Is fault in us sworn to the public good ;
We never can be of the damned crew , We may impolitic ourselves ( as 'twere ) Into the kingdom 's body politic , Whereof indeed we 're members ; you miss terms .
The things are yet the same .
Tis nothing so ; the property is alter 'd ;
You are no lawyer . Or say that oath and oath Are still the same in number , yet their species Differ extremely , as for flat example , When politic widows try men for their turn , Before they wed them , they are harlots then , But when they wed them , they are honest women ;
So private men , when they forswear , be- tray , Are perjured treachers , but being public once , That is , sworn , married to the public good Cl . Are married women public ?
Public good ;
For marriage makes them , being the public good , And could not be without them . So I say Men public , that is , being sworn or mar ried To the good public , being one body made With the realm 's body politic , are no more Private , nor can be perjured , though for sworn , More than a widow married , for the act Of generation is for that an harlot , Because for that she was so , being unmarried ;
An argument a paritus .
' Tis a shrewd one .
Who hath no faith to men , to God hath none ; "
Retain you that , sir ? Who said so ?
' Twas I.
Thy own tongue damn thine infidelity .
But captains all , you know me nobly born , Use ye t 'assault such men as I with lackeys ?
They are no lackeys , sir , but soldiersDisguised in lackeys ' coats .
Sir , we have seen the enemy .
Avaunt , ye rascals , hence !
Now leave your coats .
Let me not see them more .
I grieve that virtue lives so undis - tinguish 'd From vice in any ill , and though the crown Of sovereign law , she should be yet her footstool , Subject to censure , all the shame and painOf all her rigour .
Yet false policy Would cover all , being like offenders hid , That ( after notice taken where they hide ) The more they crouch and stir , the more are spied .
I wonder how this chanced you .
Some informer , Bloodhound to mischief , usher to the hangman , Thirsty of honour for some huge state act ,
And he ( I know not why ) held dangerous , Made me the desperate organ of his danger , Only with that poor colour ; 'tis the common And more than whore-like trick of treachery , And vermin bred to rapine and to ruin ;
For which this fault is still to be accused , Since good acts fail , crafts and deceits areused .
If it be other , never pity me .
Sir , we are glad , believe it , and have hope , The King will so conceit it .
At his pleasure .
In meantime , what 's your will , lordlieutenant ?
To leave your own horse , and to mount the trumpets .
CL It shall be done ; this heavily pre - vents My purposed recreation in these parts ;
Which now I think on , let me beg you , sir , To lend me some one captain of your troops To bear the message of my hapless ser- vice And misery , to my most noble mistress , Countess of Cambray ; to whose house this night I promised my repair , and know most truly , With all the ceremonies of her favour , She sure expects me .
Think you now on that ?
CL On that , sir ? ay , and that so worthily , That if the King , in spite of your great service , Would send me instant promise of enlargement , .
Condition I would set this message by , I would not take it , but had rather die .
Your message shall be done , sir ; I myself Will be for you a messenger of ill .
CL I thank you , sir , and doubt not yet to live To quite your kindness .
Mean space , use your spirit And knowledge for the cheerful patience Of this so strange and sudden consequence .
CL Good sir , believe that no particular torture Can force me from my glad obedience To any thing the high and general Cause , To match with his whole fabric , hath or- dain 'd : And know ye all ( though far from all your aims , Yet worth them all , and all men 's endless studies ) That in this one thing , all the disciplineOf manners and of manhood is contain 'd ;
A man to join himself with th ' Universe In his main sway , and make ( in all things fit ) One with that All , and go on , round as it : Not plucking from the whole his wretched part , And into straits , or into nought revert , Wishing the complete Universe might beSubject to such a rag of it as he ;
But to consider great Necessity , All things as well refract as voluntary Reduceth to the prime celestial cause , Which he that yields to with a man 's ap - plause , And cheek by cheek goes , crossing it no breath , But , like God 's image , follows to the death , That man is truly wise , aftd everything , ( Each cause , and every part distinguishing , ) In nature , with enough art understands , And that full glory merits at all hands , That doth the whole world at all parts adorn, And appertains to one celestial born .

So foul a scandal never man sus - tain 'd , Which caused by th ' King , is rude and tyrannous : Give me a place , and my lieutenant makeThe filler of it !
I should never look For better of him ; never trust a manFor any justice , that is rapt with pleasure ;
To order arms well , that makes smocks his ensigns , And his whole government 's sails : you heard of late , He had the four and twenty ways of veneryDone all before him .
' Twas abhorr 'd and beastly .
Tis more than nature 's mighty hand can do To make one humane and a lecher too .
Ix)ok how a wolf doth like a dog appear , So like a friend is an adulterer : Voluptuaries , and these bellygods , No more tnie men are than so many toads .
A good man happy , is a common good ;
Vile men advanced live of the common blood .
Give and then take like children .
Bounties are As soon repented as they happen rare .
What should kings do , and men of eminent places , But as they gather , sow gifts to the graces ?
And where they have given , rather give again , ( Being given for virtue ) than like babes and fools , Take and repent gifts ; why are wealth and power ?
Power and wealth move to tyranny , not bounty ;
The merchant for his wealth is swoln in mind , When yet the chief lord of it is the wind .
That may so chance to our statemerchants too ;
Something perform 'd , that hath not far to go .
That 's the main point , my lord ;
insist on that .
But doth this fire rage further ? hath it taken The tender tinder of my wife 's sere blood ?
Is she so passionate ?
So wild , so mad , She cannot live , and this unwreak 'd sustain .
The woes are bloody that in women reign .
The Sicile gulf keeps fear in less degree ;
There is no tiger not more tame than she .
There is no looking home then ?
Home ! Medea With all her herbs , charms , thunders , lightnings , Made not her presence and black haunts more dreadful .
Madam , a captain come from Cler- mont D'AmboisDesires access to you .
And not himself ?
No, madam .
That 's not well . Attend him in .

Save your ladyship .
All welcome ! Come you from my worthy servant ?
Ay , madam ; and confer such news from him .
Such news ? What news ?
News that I wish some other had the charge of .
Oh ! what charge ? what news ?
Your ladyship must use some patience Or else I cannot do him that desireHe urged with such affection to your graces .
Do it ; for heaven 's love do it , if you serve His kind desires , I will have patience .
Is he in health ?
He is .
Why , that 's the groundOf all the good estate we hold in earth ;
All our ill built upon that , is no more Than we may bear , and should ; express it all .
Madam , 'tis only this ; his liberty .
His liberty ! Without that health is nothing .
Why live I , but to ask in doubt of that , Is that bereft him ?
You 'll again prevent me .
No more , I swear ; I must hear , and together Come all my misery . I 'll hold though I burst .
Then madam , thus it fares . He was invited , By way of honour to him , to take view Of all the powers his brother Baligny Hath in his government ; which ranged in bat tails , Maillard , lieutenant to the governor , Having received strict letters from the King To train him to the musters , and betray him , To their surprise , which , with Chalon in chief , And other captains ( all the field put hard By his incredible valour for his 'scape ) They haplessly and guiltlessly perform 'd , And to Bastile he 's now led prisoner .
What change is here ! how are my hopes prevented !
O my most faithful servant ; thou betray 'd !
Will kings make treason lawful ? Is society ( To keep which only kings were first or- dain 'd ) Less broke in breaking faith 'twixt friend and friend ,
Kings are compared to gods , and should be like them , Full in all right , in nought superfluous Nor nothing straining past right , for theirright ;
Reign justly , and reign safely . Policy Is but a guard corrupted , and a way Ventured in deserts , without guide orpath .
Kings punish subjects ' errors with theirown .
Kings are like archers , and their subjects , shafts ;
For as when archers let their arrows fly , They call to them , and bid them fly or fall , As if 'twere in the free power of the shaft To fly or fall , when only 'tis the strength , Straight shooting , compass given it by the archer , That makes it hit or miss ; and doing either , He 's to be praised or blamed , and not the shaft : So kings to subjects crying , " Do , do notthis ; "
Must to them by their own examples ' strength , The straightness of their acts , and equal compass , Give subjects power t 1 obey them in thelike ;
Not shoot them forth with faulty aim and strength , And lay the fault in them for flying amiss .
But for your servant , I dare swear him guiltless .
He would not for his kingdomtraitor be ;
His laws are not so true to him as he .
O knew I how to free him , by way forced Through all their army , I would fly , anddoit ;
And had I , of my courage and resolve , But ten such more , they should not all retain him ;
But I will never die before I give Maillard an hundred slashes with a sword , Chalon an hundred breaches with a pistol .
They could not all have taken Clermont D'Ambois Without their treachery ; he had bought his bands out With their slave bloods ; but he was credulous ;
He would believe , since he would be believed ;
Your noblest natures are most credulous .
Who gives no trast , all trust is apt to break ;
Hate like hell-mouth who think not what they speak .
Well , madam , I must tender my attendance On him again . Will 't please you to re - turnNo service to him by me ?
Fetch me straight
tell him , And much too little for his matchless love But as in him the worths of many men
this are jewels Worth many cabinets . Here , with this , good sir , Commend my kindest service to my servant , Thank him , with all my comforts ; and , in them With all my life for them : all sent from himIn his remembrance of me , and true love ;
And look you tell him , tell him how I lie { She kneels down at his feet .
Prostrate at feet of his accursed misfortune , Pouring my tears out , which shall ever fall ' Till I have pour 'd for him out eyes and all .
O , madam , this will kill him : comfort you With full assurance of his quick acquittal : Be not so passionate : rise , cease your tears .
Then must my life cease . Tears are all the vent My life hath to 'scape deaf . . Tears please me better Than all life 's comforts , being the natural seed Of hearty sorrow . As a tree fruit bears , So doth an undissembled sorrow , tears .
{ He raises her , and leads her out . Exeunt .
This might have been before , and saved much charge . {Exit .
Now , sir , I hope your much abused eyes see In my word for my Clermont , what a villain He was that whisper 'd in your jealous ear His own black treason in suggesting Clermont 's ;
203 Sign then this writ for his delivery ;
Your hand was never urged with worthier boldness : Come pray , sir , sign it : why should kings be pray 'd To acts of justice ? ' Tis a reverence Makes them despised , and shows they stick and tire In what their free powers should be hot as fire .
But wherein is this Clermont such a rare one ?
In his most gentle and unwearied mind , Rightly to virtue framed ; in very nature ;
In his most firm inexorable spirit , To be removed from anything he chooseth For worthiness ; or bear the best persua - sion To what is base , or fitteth not his object ;
In his contempt of riches and of greatness ;
In estimation of th'idolatrous vulgar ;
His scorn of all things servile and ignoble , Though they could gain him never such advancement ;
His liberal kind of speaking what is truth In spite of temporizing ; the great rising And learning of his soul , so much the more Against ill fortune , as she set herself Sharp against him , or would present most hard , To shun the malice of her deadliest charge ;
His detestation of his special friends When he perceived their tyrannous will to do , Or their abjection basely to sustainAny injustice that they could revenge ;
The flexibility of his most anger , Even in the main career and fury of it , When any object of desertful pity Offers itself to him ; his sweet disposure As much abhorring to behold , as doAny unnatural and bloody action ;
His just contempt of jesters , parasites , Servile observers , and polluted tongues : In short , this Senecal man is found in him , He may with heaven 's immortal powers compare , To whom the day and fortune equal are ;
Come fair or foul , whatever chance can fall , Fix'tl in himself , he still is one to all .
Shows he to others thus ?
To all that know him .
And apprehend I this man for a traitor ?
These are your Machiavellian vil- lains , Your bastard Teucers that , their mischiefs done , Run to your shield for shelter : Caucuses That cut their too large murtherous thieveries To their dens ' length still : woe be to that state Where treachery guards , and ruin makes men great .
Go , take my letters for him , and release him .
Better a man were buried quick , than liveA property for state and spoil to thrive .

We joy you take a chance so ill , so well .
Who ever saw me differ in acceptanceOf either fortune ?
What , love bad like good ?
How should one learn that ?
To love nothing outward , Or not within our own powers to command ;
And so being sure of everything we love , Who cares to lose the rest ? If any man Would neither live nor die in his free choice , But as he sees necessity will have it( Which if he would resist , he strives in vain ) , .
What can come near him , that he doth not well , And if in worst events his will be done , How can the best be better ? All is one .
Methinks 'tis pretty .
Put no difference If you have this , or not this ; but as chil- dren Playing at quoits , ever regard their game , And care not for their quoits ; so let a maa The things themselves that touch him not esteem , But his free power in well disposing them .
Pretty from toys !
Methinks this double distich Seems prettily too to stay superfluous long ings : " Not to have want , what riches doth exceed ?
Not to be subject , what superior thing ?
He that to nought aspires , doth nothing need ;
Who breaks no law is subject to no king . "
204
O , but 'tis passing hard to stay one thus .
' Tis so ; rank custom wraps men so beyond it ;
And as 'tis hard so well men 's doors to barTo keep the cat out , and th ' adulterer ;
So 'tis as hard to curb affections so , We let in nought to make them overflow .
And as of Homer 's verses many critics On those stand , of which Time 's old moth hath eaten The first or last feet , and the perfect parts Of his unmatched poem sink beneath , With upright gasping and sloth dull as death : So the unprofitable things of life , And those we cannot compass , we affect, All that doth profit and we have , neglect ;
Like covetous and basely-getting men , That gathering much , use never what they keep , But for the least they lose , extremely weep.
This pretty talking and our horses walking Down this steep hill , spends time with equal profit .
' Tis well bestow 'd on ye , meat and men sick Agree like this , and you ; and yet even this Is th ' end of all skill , power , wealth , all that is .
I long to hear , sir , how your mistress takes this .
We soon shall know it ; see Aumale return 'd .
A u . Ease to your bands , sir .
Welcome , worthy friend .
How took his noblest mistress your sad message ?
As great rich men take sudden poverty : I never witness 'd a more noble love , Nor a more ruthful sorrow : I well wish 'dSome other had been master of my message .
You 're happy , sir , in all things , but this oneOf your unhappy apprehension .
This is to me , compared with her much moan, As one tear is to her whole passion .
Sir , she commends her kindest service to you , And this rich cabinet .
O happy man !
This may enough hold to redeem your band 's .
These clouds , I doubt not , will besoon blown over .
Your hope is just and happy ; see , sir , bothIn both the looks of these .
Here 's a discharge For this your prisoner , my good lord lieutenant .
Alas ! sir , I usurp 'd that style en- forced , And hope you know it was not my aspiring .
Well , sir , my wrong aspired past all men 's hopes .
I sorrow for it , sir .
You see , sir , thereYour prisoner 's discharge authentical .
It is , sir , and I yield it him with gladness .
Brother , I brought you down to much good purpose .
Repeat not that , sir ; the amends makes all .
I joy in it , my best and worthiest friend ;
y 'have a princely fautor of the Guise .
I think I did my part too .
Well , sir , all ' Is in the issue well : and , worthiest friend , Here 's from your friend the Guise ; here from the Countess , Yourbrother 's mistress , the contents whereof 1 know , and must prepare you now to please Th' unrested spirit of your slaughter 'd brother , If it be true , as you imagined once , His apparition show 'd it ; the complot Is now laid sure betwixt us ; therefore haste Both to your great friend ( who hath some use weighty For your repair to him ) and to the Countess , Whose satisfaction is no less important .
I see all , and will haste as it importeth ;
And , good friend , since I must delay a little My wish 'd attendance on my noblest mis - tress , Excuse me to her , with return of this , And endless protestation of my service ;
And now become as glad a messengerAs you were late a woful .
Happy change !
I ever will salute thee with my service .

205 Makes now your brother 's dying prophecy equal At all parts , being dead as he presaged .
Heaven shield the Guise from seconding that truth , With what he likewise prophesied on him .
It hath enough , 'twas graced with truth in one , To th ' other falsehood and confusion .
Lead to the Court , sir .
You I 'll lead no more ,It was too ominous and foul before .

Ascendit Umbra Bussy .
Up from the chaos of eternal night , ( To which the whole digestion of the world Is now returning ) once more I ascend , And bide the cold damp of this piercing air , To urge the justice whose almighty word Measures the bloody acts of impious men With equal penance , who in th ' act itself Includes th ' infliction , which like chained shot Batter together still ; though ( as the thunder Seems by men 's duller hearing than their sight , To break a great time after lightning forth , Yet both at one time tear the labouring cloud ) , So men think penance of their ills is slow, Though th ' ill and penance still together go .
Reform , ye ignorant men , your manless lives , Whose laws ye think are nothing but your lusts , When leaving but for supposition ' sake The body of felicity , religion , Set in the 'midst of Christendom , and her head Cleft to her bosom ; one half one way swaying , Another th ' other ; all the Christian world And all her laws , whose observation Stands upon faith , above the power of reason ;
That since the world ( as which of youdenies ? )
Stands by proportion , all may thence con- clude , That all the joints and nerves sustaining nature , As well may break , and yet the world abide , As any one good unrewarded die , Or any one ill 'scape his penalty .

Thus , friend , thou seest how all good men would thrive , Did not the good thou prompt 'st me with prevent The jealous ill pursuing them in others .
But now thy dangers are dispatch 'd , note mine ;
Hast thou not heard of that admired voice That at the barricadoes spake to me , No person seen , "let 's lead , my lord , to Rheims ? "
Nor could you learn the person ?
By no means .
CL ' Twas but your fancy then , a waking dream ;
For as in sleep , which binds both th ' out - ward senses , And the sense common too ; th ' imagining power ( Stirr 'd up by forms hid in the memory 's store , Or by the vapours of o 'erflowing humours In bodies full and foul , and mix 'd with spirits ) Feigns many strange , miraculous images , In which act it so painfully applies Itself to those forms , that the common sense It actuates with his motion ; and thereby Those fictions true seem , and have real act ;
So , in the strength of our conceits awakeThe cause alike , doth of like fictions make .
Be what it will , 'twas a presage of something Weighty and secret , which th ' advertise - ments I have received from all parts , both without And in this kingdom , as from Rome and Spain , Soccaine and Savoy , gives me cause to think ;
Will bloody prove , dissolving all our counsels .
Retire , then , from them all .
I must not do so .
The Archbishop of Lyons tells me plain I shall be said then to abandon FranceIn so important an occasion ;
And that mine enemies ( their profit making Of my faint absence ) soon would let that fall , That all my pains did to this height exhale .
Let all fall that would rise unlaw - fully : Make not your forward spirit in virtue 's right , A property for vice , by thrusting on Further than all your powers can fetch you off .
It is enough , your will is infinite To all things virtuous and religious , Which , within limits kept , may , without danger , Let virtue some good from your graces gather : Avarice of all is ever nothing 's father .
Danger , the spur of all great minds , is ever The curb to your tame spirits ; you respect not , With all your holiness of life and learning , More than the present , like illiterate vulgars .
Your mind , you say , kept in your flesh 's bounds , Shows that man 's will must ruled be by his power , When , by true doctrine , you are taught to live Rather without the body , than within, And rather to your God still than yourself ;
To live to Him , is to do all things fittingHis image , in which , like Himself , we live ;
To be His image , is to do those things That make us deathless , which by death is only ;
Doing those deeds that fit eternity ;
And those deeds are the perfecting that justice That makes the world last , which propor- tion is Of punishment and wreak for every wrong , As well as for right a reward as strong .
Away , then ; use the means thou hast to right The wrong I suffer 'd . What corrupted law Leaves unperform 'd in kings , do thou supply , | And be above them all in dignity . \Exit .
Why stand 'st thou still thus , and apply 'st thine earsAnd eyes to nothing ?
Saw you nothing here ?
Thou dream 'st awake now ; what was here to see ?
My brother 's spirit , urging his revenge .
Thy brother 's spirit ! Pray thee , mock me not .
No, by my love and service .
Would he rise , And not be thundering threats against the Guise ?
You make amends for enmity to him With ten parts more love , and desert of me ;
And as you make your hate to him no let Of any love to me , no more bears he( Since you to me supply it ) hate to you ;
Which reason and which justice is per- form 'd In spirits ten parts more than fleshy men ;
To whose fore-sights our acts and thoughts lie open ;
And therefore , since he saw the treachery Late practised by my brother Baligny , He would not honour his hand with the justice ( As he esteems it ) of his blood 's revenge , To which my sister needs would have him sworn , Before she would consent to marry him .
Gu , O , Baligny , who would believe there were A man , that ( only since his looks are raised Upwards , and have but sacred heaven in sight ) Could bear a mind so more than devilish ?
As for the painted glory of the countenance , Flitting in kings , doth good for nought esteem , And the more ill he does , the better seem .
We easily may believe it , since we see In this world 's practice few men better be .
Justice to live doth nought but justice need , But policy must still on mischief feed .
Untruth for all his ends , truth 's name doth sue in ;
None safely live but those that study ruin .
A good man happy is a common good ;
111 men advanced live of the common blood .
207 These spirits seld ' or never haunting men , But some mishap ensues .
Ensue what can ;
Tyrants may kill , but never hurt a man ;
All to his good makes , spite of death andhell .
All the desert of good , renown your highness !
Welcome , Aumale .
My good friend , friendly welcome .
How took my noblest mistress the changed news ?
It came too late , sir , for those love - liest eyes ( Through which a soul look 'd so divinely loving , Tears nothing uttering her distress enough ) She wept quite out , and like two falling stars Their dearest sights quite vanish 'd with her tears .
All good forbid it !
What events are these ?
All must be borne , my lord : and yet this chance Would willingly enforce a man to cast off All power to bear with comfort , since he sees In this , our comforts made our miseries .
How strangely thou art loved of both the sexes ;
Yet thou lovest neither , but the good of both .
CL In love of women , my affection first Takes fire out of the frail parts of my blood : Which till I have enjoy 'd , is passionate , Like other lovers ' ; but , fruition past , I then love out of judgment ; the desert Of her I love still sticking in my heart , Though the desire and the delight be gone , Which must chance still , since the com- parison Made upon trial 'twixt what reason loves , And what affection , makes in me the bestEver preferr 'd ; what most love , valuing lest .
Thy love being judgment then , and of the mind , Marry thy worthiest mistress now being blind .
CL If there were love in marriage , so I would : But I deny that any man doth love , Affecting wives , maid , widows , any women For neither flies love milk , although they drown In greedy search thereof ; nor doth the bee Love honey , though the labour of her life Is spent in gathering it ; nor those that fat On beasts , or fowls , do anything therein For any love : for as when only nature Moves men to meat , as far as her power rules , She doth it with a temperate appetite , The too much men devour , abhorring nature ;
And in our most health , is our most disease ;
So , when humanity rules men and women,Tis for society confined in reason .
But what excites the bed 's desire in blood ,By no means justly can be construed love ;
For when love kindles any knowing spirit , It ends in virtue and effects divine, And is in friendship chaste and masculine .
Thou shah my mistress be ; me- thinks my blood Is taken up to all love with thy virtues .
And howsoever other men despiseThese paradoxes strange , and too precise ;
Since they hold on the right way of our reason , I could attend them ever . Come , away ;
Perform thy brother 's thus importuned wreak ;
Saw you his saucy forcing of my handTo D'Ambois ' freedom ?
Saw , and through mine eyes Let fire into my heart , that burn 'd to bearAn insolence so giantly austere .
The more kings bear at subjects ' hands , the more Their lingering justice gathers ; that re - sembles The weighty and the goodly-bodied eagle , Who , being on earth , before her shady wings Can raise her into air , a mighty way Close by the ground she runs ; but being aloft , All she commands , she flies at ; and the : moreDeath in her seres bears , the more time ;
she stays Her thundery stoop from that on which ' she preys .
208
We have spies set on us , as we on others ; ^ And therefore they that serve us must excuse us , If what we most hold in our hearts , take wind ;
Deceit hath eyes that see into the mind .
But this plot shall be quicker than their twinkling , On whose lids Fate , with her dead weight shall lie , And Confidence that lightens ere she die .
Friends of my guard , as ye gave oath to beTrue to your sovereign , keep it manfully ;
Your eyes have witness 'd oft th ' ambition That never made access to me in GuiseBut treason ever sparkled in his eyes ;
Which if you free us of , our safety shallYou not our subjects , but our patrons call .
Our duties bind us , he is now but dead .
We trust in it , and thank ye .
Baligny , | Go lodge their ambush , and thou God that art Fautor of princes , thunder from the skies , Beneath his hill of pride this giant Guise .

I see y 'are servant , sir , to my dear sister , The lady of her loved Baligny .
Madam , I am bound to her virtuous bounties , For that life which I offer in her service, To the revenge of her renowned brother .
She writes to me as much , and much desires , That you may be the man , whose spirit she knows Will cut short off these long and dull delays , Hitherto bribing the eternal Justice ;
Which I believe , since her unmatched spirit Can judge of spirits , that have her sulphur in them ;
But I must tell you , that I make no doubt , Her living brother will revenge her dead , On whom the dead imposed the task , and he , I know , will come t 'effect it instantly .
They are but words in him ; believe them not .
See ; this is the vault , where he must enter ;
Where now I think he is .
God save you , lady .
What gentleman is this , with whom you trust The deadly weighty secret of this hour ?
One that yourself will say , I well may trust .
Then come up , madam .

I am provided then to take his place And undertaking on me .
You , sir ! why ?
Since I am charged so by my mis - tress , His mournful sister .
Good madam , I rue your fate , more than mine ,
They stand on such occurrents .
209 Re . This , indeed , I know to be your lady mistress ' hand , And know besides , his brother will and mustEndure no hand in this revenge but his .
Away , dispute no more ; get up and see , Clermont must author this just tragedy .
Who 's that ?
The spirit of Bussy .
O , my servant ! let us embrace .
Forbear ! The air in whichMy figure 's likeness is impress 'd , will blast ;
The black soft-footed hour is now on wing , Which , for my just wreak , ghosts shall celebrateWith dances dire and of infernal state .

Who says that death is natural , when nature Is with the only thought of it dismay 'd ?
I have had lotteries set up for my death , And I have drawn beneath my trencher one , Knit in my handkerchief another lot , The word being , ' ' Y'are a dead man if you enter ; "
And these words , this imperfect blood and flesh , Shrink at in spite of me , their solidest part Melting like snow within me , with cold fire : 1 hate myself , that seeking to rule kings , I cannot curb my slave . Would any spirit , Free , manly , princely , wish to live to be Commanded by this mass of slavery , Since reason , judgment , resolution , And scorn of what we fear , will yield to fear ?
While this same sink of sensuality swells , Who would live sinking in it , and not spring Up to the stars , and leave this carrion here For wolves , and vultures , and for dogs to tear ?
O , Clermont D'Ambois , wert thou here to chide This softness from my flesh , far as my reason , Far as my resolution , not to stirOne foot out of the way , for death and hell .
Let my false man by falsehood perish here , There 's no way else to set my true man clear .
The King desires your grace to come to council .
I come . It cannot be : he will not dare To touch me with a treachery so profane .
Would Clermont now were here , to try how he Would lay about him , if this plot should be : Here would be tossing souls into the sky .
Who ever knew blood saved by treachery ?
Well , I must on , and will ; what should I I fear ?
Not against two Alcides : against two , And Hercules to friend , the Guise will go .
He takes up the arras , and the Guardenters upon him : he draws .
In greatness , not in goodness : where is theKing ?
The King comes in sight with Epernon ,Soissons , and others .
Let him appear to justify his deed .
In spite of my betray 'd wounds ; ere my soul Take her flight through them , and my tongue hath strengthTo urge his tyranny .
See , sir , I am come To justify it before men , and God , Who knows with what wounds in my heart for woe Of your so wounded faith , I made these wounds , Forced to it by an insolence of force To stir a stone , nor as a rock opposed To all the billows of the churlish sea , More beat , and eaten with them , than was IWith your ambitious mad idolatry ;
And this blood I shed , is to save the bloodOf many thousands .
That 's your white pretext , But you will find one drop of blood shed lawless Will be the fountain to a purple sea : The present lust and shift made for kings ' lives Against the pure form and just power of law ,
Well , sir , I 'll bear it ; ye have a brother too , Bursts with like threats , the scarlet Cardinal : Seek , and lay hands on him ; and take this hence , Their bloods , for all you , on my conscience .

mine , death hath curb 'd .
Clermont , farewell : O didst thou see but this !
But it is better , see by this the ice Broke to thine own blood , which thou wilt despise , When thou hear 'st mine shed . Is there no friend here Will bear my love to him ?
I will , my lord .
Thanks with my last breath : re - commend me thenTo the most worthy of the race of men .

Who have you let into my house ?
I , none .
' Tis false ; I savour the rank blood of foesIn every corner .
That you may do well , It is the blood you lately shed , you smell .
'Sdeath , the vault opes .
{ The gulf opens .
What vault ? Hold your sword .
No, let him use it .
Treason , murther , murther !
Exclaim not ; 'tis in vain , and base in you , Being one to only one .
O bloody strumpet !
With what blood charge you her ?
It may be mine As well as yours ; there shall not any else Enter or touch you ; I confer no guards , Nor imitate the murtherous course you took ;
But , single here , will have my former challenge Now answer 'd single ; not a minute moreMy brother 's blood shall stay for his revenge .
If I can act it ; if not , mine shall add A double conquest to you , that alone Put it to fortune now , and use no odds , Storm not , nor beat yourself thus 'gainst the doors Like to a savage vermin in a trap ;
All doors are sure made , and you cannot 'scape But by your valour .
No, no ; come and kill me .
If you will die so like a beast , you shall ;
But when the spirit of a man may save you ,Do not so shame man , and a noble man .
I do not show this baseness that I fear thee , But to prevent and shame thy victory , Which of one base is base , and so I 'll die .
Here , then .
And since I must afford thee victory , It shall be great and brave , if one requestThou wilt admit me .
What 's that ?
Give me leave To fetch and use the sword thy brother gave me When he was bravely giving up his life .
No, I '11 not fight against my brother 's sword ;
Not that I fear it , but since 'tis a trickFor you to show your back .
By all truth , no :Take but my honourable oath , I will not .
Your honourable oath ? Plain truth no place hasWhere oaths are honourable .
Trust not his oath .
He will lie like a lapwing , when she flies Far from her sought nest , still " here 'tis , " she cries .
Out on my fortune , to wed such an abject .
Now is the people 's voice the voice of God ;
He that to wound a woman vaunts so much ( As he did me ) , a man dares never touch .
Revenge your wounds now , madam ;
I resign him Up to your full will , since he will not fight .
First you shall torture him ( as he did you , And Justice wills ) , and then pay I my vow .
Here , take this poniard .
Sink earth , open heaven, And let fall vengeance .
Come , sir , good sir , hold him .
O , shame of women , whither art thou fled ?
Why , good my lord , is it a greater shame For her than you ? Come , I will be the bands You used to her , profaning her fair hands .
No, sir ; I 'll fight now , and the terror be Of all you champions to such as she .
I did but thus far dally : now observe , O all you aching foreheads , that have robb 'd Your hands of weapons , and your hearts of valour , Join in me all your rages and rebutters , " And into dust ram this same race of furies , In this one relic of the Ambois gall , In his one purple soul shed , drown it all .

Receive it freely .
What think y 'a this now ?
It is very noble ;
Had it been free , at least , and of yourself , And thus we see ( where valour most doth vaunt ) What 'tis to make a coward valiant .
Now I shall grace your conquest .
That you shall .
If you obtain it .
True , sir , 'tis in fortune .
If you were not a D'Ambois , I would scarce Change lives with you , I feel so great a change In my tall spirits ; breathed , I think , with the breath A D'Ambois breathes here , and necessity ( With whose point now prick 'd on , and so , whose help My hands may challenge , that doth all men conquer , If she except not you , of all men only ) May change the case here .
True , as you are changed , Her power in me urged , makes y ' another man Than yet you ever were .
Well , I must on .
Your lordship must , by all means .
Then at all .
{Fights , and D'Ambois hurts him .
Charlotte above .
Death of my father ! what a shame is this , Stick in his hands thus ?
Gentle sir , forbear .
No, madam , but hurt in divers parts of him .
Y'have given it me, And yet I feel life for another veney .
What would you , sir ?
I would perform this combat .
Against which of us ?
I care not much if 'twere Against thyself : thy sister would have shamed To have thy brother 's wreak with any man , In single combat , stick so in her fingers .
My sister ? know you her ?
Ay , sir , she sent him With this kind letter , to perform the wreakOi my dear servant .
Now , alas ! good , sir, Think you you could do more ?
Alas ! I do , And were 't not , I , fresh , sound , should charge a man Weary and wounded , I would long ere thisHave proved what I presume on .
Y'have a mind Like to my sister , but have patience now , If next charge speed not , I 'll resign to you .
Pray thee let him decide it .
No, my lord , I am the man in fate , and since so bravely Your lordship stands me , 'scape but one more charge , And on my life , I 'll set your life at large .
Said like a D'Ambois , and if now I die .
Sit joy and all good on thy victory .

Noble and Christian !
O , it breaks my heart !
And should ; for all faults found in him before , These words , this end , makes full amends and more .
Rest , worthy soul , and with it the dear spirit Of my loved brother , rest in endless peace ;
Soft lie thy bones , Heaven be your soul 's abode, And to your ashes be the earth no load .
P 2
they dance about the dead body , and Exeunt .
How strange is this ! the Guise amongst these spirits , And his great brother Cardinal , both yet living , And that the rest with them , with joy thus celebrate This our revenge ! This certainly presages Some instant death both to the Guise and Cardinal .
That the Chatillon 's ghost too should thus join In celebration of this just revenge , With Guise , that bore a chief stroke in his death , It seems that now he doth approve the act , And these true shadows of the Guise and Cardinal , Fore-running thus their bodies , may approve That all things to be done , as here we live,Are done before all times in th ' other life .
That spirits should rise in these times yet are fables ;
Though learned 'st men hold that our sen- sive spirits A little time abide about the graves Of their deceased bodies ; and can take In cold condensed air the same forms they had , When they were shut up in this body 's shade .
O sir , the Guise is slain !
Avert it , heaven !
Sent for to council , by the King , an ambush { Lodged for the purpose ) rush 'd on him , and took His princely life ; who sent , in dying then , His love to you , as to the best of men .
The worst , and most accursed of things creeping On earth 's sad bosom . Let me pray ye all A little to forbear , and let me useFreely mine own mind in lamenting him .
I 'll call ye straight again .
We will forbear , and leave you free ,sir . \Exeunt .
Shall I live , and heDead , that alone gave means of life to me ?
There 's no disputing with the acts of kings , Revenge is impious on their sacred persons : And could I play the worldling ( no man loving Longer than gain is reapt , or grace from him ) I should survive , and shall be wonder 'd at Though in mine own hands being , I end with him : But friendship is the cement of two minds , As of one man the soul and body is , Of which one cannot sever , but the otherSurfers a needful separation .
{ Descend Ren . and Coun .
I fear your servant , madam ; let 's descend .
Since I could skill of man , I never lived To please men worldly , and shall I in death , Respect their pleasures , making such a jar Betwixt my death and life , when death should make The consort sweetest ; th ' end being proof and crown To all the skill and worth we truly own ?
Guise , O my lord , how shall I cast from me The bands and coverts hindering me from thee ?
The garment or the cover of the mind , The humane soul is ; of the soul , the spiritThe proper robe is ; of the spirit , the blood ;
And of the blood , the body is the shroud .
With that must I begin then to unclothe , And come at th ' other . Now then as a ship , Touching at strange and farremovedshores ;
Her men ashore go , for their several ends , Fresh water , victuals , precious stones , and pearl , All yet intentive ( when the master calls , The ship to put off ready ) to leave all Their greediest labours , lest they there be left To thieves , or beasts , or be the country 's slaves : So , now my master calls , my ship , my venture , All in one bottom put , all quite put off , Gone under sail , and I left negligent , To all the horrors of the vicious time , The far-removed shores to all virtuous aims , None favouring goodness ; none but he respecting Piety or manhood ; shall I here survive , Not cast me after him into the sea , Rather than here live , ready every hour To feed thieves , beasts , and be the slave of power ?
213 Enter Aumale , Tamyra , Charlotte .
What ! lie and languish , Clermont ?
Cursed man , To leave him here thus : he hath slain himself .
Misery on misery ! O me , wretched dame Of all that breathe , all heaven turn all his eyes , In hearty envy thus on one poor dame .
Well done , my brother ; I did love thee ever , But now adore thee : loss of such a friendNone should survive , of such a brother ;
With my false husband live , and both these slain ?
Ere I return to him , I 'll turn to earth .
Horror of human eyes ! O Clermont D'Ambois !
Madam , we stay 'd too long ; your servant 's slain .
It must be so ; he lived but in the Guise, As I in him . O follow , life , mine eyes .
Hide , hide thy snaky head ; to cloisters fly , In penance pine , too easy 'tis to die .
It is . In cloisters then let 's all survive : Madam , since wrath nor grief can help these fortunes , Let us forsake the world in which they reign , And for their wish 'd amends to God complain .
Tis fit and only needful : lead me on , In heaven 's course comfort seek , in eartk is none . \Exeunt , Enter Henry , Epernon , Soissons , andothers .
