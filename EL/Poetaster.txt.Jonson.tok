TO THE
VERTUOUS and my WORTHY FRIEND ,
Mr. Richard Martin .
SIR ,
AThankful Man owes a Courtesie ever : the unthankful , but when he needs it .
To make mine own mark appear , and shew by which of these Seals I am known , I send you this Piece of what may live of mine ; for whose Innocence , as for the Authors , you were once a Noble and Timely Undertaker , to the greatest Justice of this Kingdom .
Enjoy now the delight of your Goodness ; which is to see that prosper , you preserv 'd : and Posterity to owe the reading of that , without offence , to your Name , which so much Ignorance , and Malice of the Times , then conspir 'd to have supprest .
Your true Lover ,

P O E T A S T E R.
After the second sounding .
of the Stage .
LIght , I salute thee , but with wounded Nerves :
Wishing thy Golden splendor , pitchy darkness .
What 's here ?
th ' Arraignment ?
I : This , this is it .
That our sunk Eyes have wak't for all this while :
Here will be subject for my Snakes , and me .
Cling to my Neck , and Wrists , my loving Worms ,
And cast you round in soft and amorous foulds ,
Till I do bid , uncurl : Then break your Knots ,
Shoot out your selves at length , as your forc't Stings
Would hide themselves within his malic't sides ,
To whom I shall apply you .
Stay ! the shine
Of this Assembly here offends my sight ,
I 'll darken that first , and Out-face their Grace .
Wonder not , if I stare : these Fifteen Weeks
( So long as since the Plot was but an Embrion )
Have I , with burning Lights mixt vigilant Thoughts ,
In expectation of this hated Play ;
To which ( at last ) I am arriv 'd as Prologue .
Nor would I , you should look for other Looks ,
Gesture , or Complement from me , than what
Th' infected bulk of Envy can afford :
For I am riss here with a covetous hope ,
To blast your Pleasures and destroy your Sports ,
With Wrestings , Comments , Applications ,
Spy-like Suggestions , privy Whisperings ,
And thousand such promooting sleights as these .
I am prevented ; all my hopes are crost ,
Check't , and abated ; fie , a freezing sweat
Flows forth at all my Pores , my Entrails burn :
What should I do ?
Rome ?
Rome ?
O my vext Soul ,
How might I force this to the present state ?
Are there no Players here ?
no Poet-apes ,
That come with Basilisks Eyes , whose forked Tongues
Are steept in venom , as their Hearts in Gall ?
Either of these would help me ; they could wrest ,
Pervert , and poyson all they hear , or see ,
With senseless Glosses , and Allusions .
Now if you be good Devils , fly me not .
You know what dear and ample Faculties
I have endow 'd you with : I 'll lend you more .
Here , take my Snakes among you , come , and eat ,
And while the squeez 'd juice flows in your black Jaws ,
Help me to dam the Author .
Spit it forth
Upon his Lines , and shew your rusty Teeth
At every Word , or Accent : or else choose
Out of my longest Vipers , to stick down
In your deep Throats ; and let the Heads come forth
At your ranck Mouths ; that he may see you arm 'd
With triple Malice , to hiss , sting , and tear
His work and him ; to forge , and then declaim ,
Traduce , corrupt , apply , enforce , suggest :
O , these are gifts wherein your Souls are blest .
What ?
do you hide your selves ?
will none appear ?
None answer ?
what , doth this calm Troop affright you ?
Nay , then I do despair ?
down , sink again .
This travail is all lost with my dead hopes .
If in such Bosoms Spight have left to dwell ,
Envy is not on Eorth , nor scarse in Hell .
The third Sounding .
P R O L O G U E.
STay Monster , ere thou sink , thus on thy Head
Set we our bolder Foot ; with which we tread
Thy Malice into Earth : So spight should dye ,
Despis 'd and scorn 'd by noble Industry .
If any muse why I salute the Stage ,
An armed Prologue ; know , 'tis a dangerous Age :
That fill up Rooms in fair and formal shapes .
' Gainst these , have we put on this forc't defence :
Whereof the Allegory and hid sense
Is , that a well erected Confidence
Can fright their Pride , and laugh their Folly hence .
Here now , put case our Author should , once more ,
Swear that his Play were good ; he doth implore ,
You would not argue him of Arrogance :
How e 're that common Spawn of Ignorance ,
Our fry of Writers may beslime his Fame ,
Which with a constant firmness he pursues ,
As one that knows the strength of his own Muse .
And this he hopes all free Souls will allow ;
Others , that take it with a rugged brow ,
Their Moods he rather pitties than envies :
His Mind it is above their Iujuries .
My name shall live , and my best part aspire .
It shall go so .
Young Master , Master Ovid , do you hear ?
Gods
a me ! away with your Songs , and Sonnets ; and on with
your Gown and Cap , quickly : here , here , your Father
will be a Man of this room presently .
Come , nay , nay ,
nay , nay , be brief .
These Verses too , a poyson on 'em ,
I cannot abide 'em , they make me ready to cast by the
Banks of Helicon .
Nay look , what a rascally untoward
thing this Poetry is ; I could tear 'em now .
Give me , how neer 's my Father ?
Heart a Man : get a Law-book in your hand , I
will not answer you else .
Why so : now there 's some
formality in you .
By Jove , and three or four of the
Gods more , I am right of mine old Masters humour
for that ; this villanous Poetry will undo you , by the
What , hast thou Buskins on , Luscus , that thou
swear 'st so tragically and high ?
O Lusc .
No, but I have Boots on , Sir , and so has your Fa -
ther too by this time : for he call 'd for 'em e 're I came
from the Lodging .
Why ?
was he no readier ?
O no ; and there was the mad skeldring Cap -
tain , with the Velvet Arms , ready to lay hold on him as
he comes down : he that presses every Man he meets ,
with an Oath , to lend him Money , and cries , ( Thou
must do 't , old Boy , as thou art a Man , a Man of
Who ?
Pantilius Tucca ?
I , he ; and I met little Master Lupus , the Tri-
bune , going thither too .
Nay , an' he be under their Arrest , I may ( with
safety enough ) read over my Elegy before he come .
Gods a me ! What 'll you do ?
why , young Ma -
ster , you are not Castalian Mad , Lunatick , Frantick ,
Desperate ?
ha ?
What ailest thou , Luscus ?
God be with you , Sir , I 'll leave you to your Poe-
tical Fancies , and Furies .
I 'll not be guilty , I.
Be not , good ignorance : I 'm glad th'art gone :
For thus alone , our Ear shall better judge
The hasty Errours of our Moning Muse .
ENvy , why twit 'st thou me , my time 's spent ill ?
And call 'st my Verse , fruits of an idle quill ?
Or that (unlike the Line from whence I sprung )
Wars dusty Honours I pursue not young ?
Or that I study not the tedious Laws ;
And prostitute my voyce in every Cause ?
Thy scope is mortal ; mine , eternal fame :
Which through the World shall ever chaunt my Name .
Homer will live , whil 'st Tenedos stands , and Ide ,
Or , to the Sea , fleet Simois doth slide :
And so shall Hesiod too , while Vines do bear ,
Or croocked Sickles crop the ripened Ear .
Callimachus , though in invention low ,
Shall still be sung , since he in art doth flow .
No loss shall come to Sophocles proud vein ;
With Sun and Moon Aratus shall remain .
Whil 'st Slaves be false , Fathers hard , and Bawds be whorish ,
Whil 'st Harlots flatter , shall Menander flourish .
Ennius , though rude , and Accius high-rear 'd strain ,
A fresh applause in every Age shall gain .
Of Varro 's name , what Ear shall not be told ?
Of Jason 's Argo and the Fleece of Gold ?
Then shall Lucretius lofty numbers dye ,
When Earth and Seas in Fire and Flames shall fry .
Tytirus , Tillage , ?nee sholl be read ,
Whilst Rome of all the Conquer 'd World is Head .
Till Cupid 's Fires be out , and his Bow broken ,
Thy Verses ( neat Tibullus ) shall be spoken .
Our Gallus shall be known from East to West :
So shall Lycoris , whom he now loves best .
The suffering Plough-share or the Flint may wear :
But Heavenly Poesie no death can fear .
Kings shall give place to it , and kingly shows ,
The Banks o 're which Gold-bearing Tagus flows .
Kneell Hinds to trash : me let bright Ph?bus
swell
With Cups full flowing from the Muses Well .
Frost-fearing Myrtle shall impale my Head ,
And of sad Lovers I 'll be often read .
" Envy , the Living , not the Dead , doth bite :
" For after death all Men receive their right .
Then , when this Body falls in Funeral Fire ,
My Name shall live , and my best part aspire .
YOur Name shall live indeed , Sir ; you say true :
but how infamously , how scorn 'd and contemn 'd
in the Eyes and Ears of the best and gravest Romans ,
that you think not on : you never so much as dream of
Are these the Fruits of all my travel and expences ?
is this the Scope and Aim of thy Studies ?
are these the
hopeful Courses , wherewith I have so long flattered my
expectation from thee ?
Verses ?
Poetry ?
Ovid , whom I
thought to see the Pleader , become Ovid the Play-
maker ?
No, Sir .
Yes , Sir . I hear of a Tragedy of yours com-
ing forth for the common Players there , call 'd Medea .
What ?
shall I have
my Son a Stager now ?
an Enghle for Players ?
a Gull ?
a Rook ?
a Shot-clog ?
to make Suppers , and be laught
at ?
Publius , I will set thee on the Funeral Pile first .
Sir , I beseech you to have patience .
Nay , this 'tis to have your Ears dam 'd up to
good Counsel .
I did augure all this to him before-hand ,
without poring into an Oxes Panch for the matter , and
yet he would not be scrupulous .
How now , Goodman Slave ?
what rowly powly ?
all Rivals , Rascal ?
Why my Master of worship , dost
hear ?
Are these thy best Projects ?
is this thy Designs
and thy Discipline , to suffer Knaves to be competitors
with Commanders and Gentlemen ?
are we Parallels ,
Rascal ?
are we Parallels ?
Sirrah , go get my Horses ready .
You 'll still
be prating .
Do , you perpetual Stinkard , do , go ; talk to
Tapsters and Ostlers , you Slave , they are i' your Ele -
ment , go ; here be the Emperors Captains , you Ragga -
muffin Rascal , and not your Cam 'rades .
Indeed , Marcus Ovid , these Players are an idle
Generation , and do much harm in a State , corrupt
young Gentry very much , I know it : I have not been
a Tribune thus long and observ 'd nothing : Besides , they
will rob us , us , that are Magistrates , of our respect ,
bring us upon their Stages , and make us ridiculous to
the Plebeians ; they will play you , or me , the wisest Men
they can come by still ; only to bring us in contempt
with the vulgar , and make us cheap .
Th'art in the right , my venerable Cropshin ,
they will indeed : the Tongue of the Oracle never
twang 'd truer .
Your Courtier cannot kiss his Mistresses
Slippers in quiet for 'em : nor your white innocent Gal-
lant pawn his Revelling Sute to make his Punk a Sup -
An honest decayed Commander cannot Skelder ,
Cheat , nor be seen in a Bawdy-house , but he shall be
strait in one of their Worm-wood Comedies .
They are
grown licentious , the Rogues ; Libertines , flat Liber-
They forget they are i' the Statute , the Rascals ,
they are blazon 'd there , there they are trickt , they and
their Pedigrees ; they need no other Heralds , I wiss .
Methinks , if nothing else , yet this alone ,
the very reading of the Publick Edicts , should fright thee
from Commerce with them , and give thee distaste e-
They wrong me , Sir , and do abuse you
more ,
That blow your Ears with these untrue Reports .
I am not known unto the open Stage ,
Nor do I Traffick in their Theaters .
Indeed , I do acknowledg , at request
Of
Of some meer Friends , and honourable Romans ,
I have begun a Poem of that nature .
You have , Sir , a Poem ?
and where is't ?
that 's the Law you study .
Cornelius Gallus borrowed it to read .
Cornelius Gallus ?
There 's another Gallant ,
too , hath drunk of the same Poyson : and Tibullus , and
But these are Gentlemen of Means and Re-
veneues now .
Thou art a younger Brother , and hast
nothing but thy bare exhibition : which I protest shall
be bare indeed , if thou forsake not these unprofitable
By-courses , and that timely too .
Name me a profest
Poet , that his Poetry did ever afford him so much as a
I , your God of Poets there ( whom all
of you admire and reverence so much ) Homer , he whose
Worm-eaten Statue must not be spew 'd against , but with
hallowed Lips , and groveling Adoration , what was he ?
what was he ?
Marry , I 'll tell thee , old Swaggerer ; He was a
poor , blind , riming Rascal , that liv 'd obscurely up and
down in Booths , and Tap-houses , and scarce ever made
a good Meal in his sleep , the Whorson hungry beg-
He says well : Nay , I know this nettles you
now , but answer me ; Is't not true ?
you 'll tell me his
name shall live ; and that ( now being dead ) his works
have eternis 'd him , and made him Divine .
But could
this Divinity feed him , while he liv 'd ?
could his name
feast him ?
Or purchase him a Senators Revenue ?
could it ?
I , or give him Place in the Common -
wealth ?
Worship , or Attendants ?
make him be carried
in his Litter ?
Thou speakest Sentences , old Bias .
All this the Law will do , young Sir , if you 'll
follow it .
If he be mine , he shall follow and observe ,
what I will apt him to , or , I profess here openly , and
utterly to disclaim him .
Sir , let me crave you will forgo these
Moods ;
I will be any thing , or study any thing :
I 'll prove the unfashion 'd Body of the Law
Pure elegance , and make her rugged 'st strains
Run smoothly , as Propertius Elegies .
Propertius Elegies ?
good !
Nay , you take him too quickly , Marcus .
Why , he cannot speak , he cannot think out
of Poetry , he is bewicht with it .
Come , do not mis-prize him .
Mis-prize ?
I , marry , I would have him use
some such words now : They have some touch , some taste
of the Law .
He should make himself a stile out of these ,
and let his Propertius Elegies go by .
Indeed , young Publius , he that will now hit the
Mark , must shoot through the Law ; we have no other
Planet Reigns , and in that Sphear , you may sit and sing
with Angels .
Why , the Law makes a Man happy ,
without respecting any other Merit : a simple Schollar , or
none at all , may be a Lawyer .
He tells thee true , my noble Neophyte ; my little
Grammaticaster , he do 's : It shall never put thee to thy
Mathematicks , Metaphysicks , Philosophy , and I know not
what suppos 'd sufficiencies ; if thou canst but have the
patience to plod enough , talk , and make a noise enough ,
be impudent enough , and 'tis enough .
Three Books will furnish you .
And the less Art , the better : Besides , when it
shall be in the power of thy Chevril Conscience , to do
right , or wrong , at thy pleasure , my pretty Alcibiades .
I , and to have better Men than himself , by ma -
ny thousand degrees , to observe him , and stand bare .
True , and he to carry himself proud , and stately ,
and have the Law on his side for't , old Boy .
Well , the day grows old , Gentlemen , and
I must leave you .
Publius , if thou wilt hold my fa -
vour , abandon these idle fruitless Studies that so bewitch
Send Janus home his Back-face again , and look
only forward to the Law : Intend that .
I will allow
thee what shall sute thee in the Rank of Gentlemen ,
and maintain thy Society with the best : and under these
Conditions , I leave thee .
My blessings light upon thee ,
if thou respect them : if not , mine Eyes may drop for
thee , but thine own Heart will ake for it self ; and so
What , are my Horses come ?
Yes , Sir , they are at the Gate without .
That 's well .
Asinius Lupus , a word .
Cap -
tain , I shall take my leave of you ?
No, my little old Boy , dispatch with Cothurnus
there : I 'll attend thee , I ? ?
To borrow some ten Drachmes , I know his Project .
Sir , you shall make me beholding to you .
Now Captain Tucca , what say you ?
Why , what should I say ?
or what can I say , my
flower o ' the Order ?
Should I say , thou art Rich ?
or
that thou art Honourable ?
or Wise ?
or Valiant ?
or
Learned ?
or Liberal ?
Why , thou art all these , and thou
knowest it ( my noble Lucullus ) thou knowest it : come ,
be not ashamed of thy Vertues , old Stump .
Honours a
good brooch to wear in a Mans Hat , at all times .
Thou
art the Man of Wars Mec?nas ,
old Boy .
Why shouldst
not thou be grac't then by them , as well as he is by his
Poets ?
How now , my Carrier , what News .
The Boy has staied within for his Cue , this half hour .
Come , do not whisper to me , but speak it out :
what ?
it is no Treason against the State , I hope , is't ?
Yes , against the State of my Masters Purse .
Sir , Agrippa desires you to forbear him till the
next Week : his Moils are not yet come up .
His Moils , now the Bots , the Spavin , and the
Glanders , and some dozen Diseases more , light on him
and his Moils .
What ha' they the yellows , his Moils ,
that they come no faster ?
or are they foundred ?
ha ?
his Moils ha' the Staggers belike : ha' they ?
O no , Sir : then your Tongue might be suspected
for one of his Moils .
He owes me almost a Talent , and he thinks to
bear it away with his Moils , does he ?
Sirrah , you , Nut-
cracker , go your ways to him again , and tell him I must
ha' Money , I : I cannot eat Stones and Turfs , say .
What , will he clem me and my Followers ?
Ask him
an' he will clem me ; do , go .
He would have me fry
my Jerkin , would he ?
Away , Setter , away .
Yet , stay
my little Tumbler ; this old Boy shall supply now .
Iwill not trouble him , I cannot be importunate , I : I can-
not be impudent .
Alas , Sir , no ; you are the most maidenly blush -
ing Creature upon the Earth .
Dost thou hear , my little six and fifty , or there -
abouts ?
Thou art not to learn the Humours and Tricks
of that old bald Cheater Time : thou hast not this Chain
for nothing .
Men of worth have their Chymera 's , as
well as other Creatures : and they do see Monsters ,
sometimes : they do , they do , brave Boy .
Better cheap than he shall see you , I warrant
Thou must let me have six , six Drachmes , I mean ,
old Boy ; thou shalt do it : I tell thee , old Boy , thou
shalt , and in private too , dost thou see ?
Go , walk off :
there , there .
Six is the Sum .
Thy Son 's a Gallant Spark ,
and must not be put out of a sudden : come hither , Cal-
limachus , thy Father tells me thou art too Poetical , Boy ;
thou must not be so , thou must leave them , young Novice ,
thou must ; they are a sort of poor starv 'd Rascals ; that
are ever wrapt up in foul Linnen ; and can boast of no-
thing but a lean Visage , peering out of a Seam-rent Sute ;
the very Emblems of Beggery .
No, dost hear ?
turn Lawyer ,
Thou shalt be my Solicitor .
' Tis right , old Boy , ist ?
O 2 Ovid .
You were best tell it , Captain .
No: fare thou well mine honest Horse-man , and
thou old Bever .
Pray thee Roman , when thou comest
to Town , see me at my Lodging , visit me sometimes :
thou shalt be welcom , old Boy .
Do not balk me , good
Jove keep thy Chain from pawning , go
thy ways , if thou lack Money , I 'll lend thee some : I 'll
leave thee to thy Horse now .
Farewel , good Captain .
Boy , you can have but half a share now , Boy .
' Tis a strange boldness that accompanies this
Fellow : Come .
I 'll give attendance on you to your Horse ,
Sir , please you ? ?
Ovid se .
No: keep your Chamber , and fall to your
Studies ; do so : the Gods of Rome bless thee .
And give me stomak to digest this Law .
That should have followed sure , had I been he .
O sacred Poesie , thou Spirit of Roman Arts ,
The Soul of Science , and the Queen of Souls ;
What prophane Violence , almost Sacrilege ,
Hath here been offered thy Divinities !
That thine own guiltless Poverty should arm
Prodigious Ignorance to wound thee thus !
For thence is all their force of Argument
Drawn forth against thee ; or from the abuse
Of thy great powers in adult 'rate Brains :
When , would Men learn but to distinguish Spirits ,
And set true difference 'twixt those jaded Wits
That run a broken pace for common hire ,
And the high Raptures of a happy Muse ,
Borne on the Wings of her immortal thought ,
That kicks at Earth with a disdainful Heel ,
And beats at Heaven Gates with her bright Hoofs ;
They would not then with such distorted Faces ,
And desp'rate Censures , stab at Poesie .
They would admire bright Knowledg and their Minds
Should ne 're descend on so unworthy Objects
As Gold , or Titles : they would dread far more ,
To be thought ignorant , than be known poor .
' The time was once , when Wit drown 'd Wealth : but now ,
' Your only Barbarism is t ' have Wit , and want .
' No matter now in Vertue who excels ,
' He that hath Coin , hath all perfection else .
Who 's there ?
Gome in .
Good
morrow , Lawyer .
Good morrow ( dear Tibullus ) welcom : sit down .
Not I.
What , so hard at it ?
Let 's see , what 's here ?
Nay , I will see it ?
Prithee away ?
If thrice in Field , a man vanquish his Foe ,
' Tis after in his choice to serve , or no .
How now Ovid ! Law Cases in Verse ?
In troth , I know not : they run from my Pen
Unwittingly , if they be Verse .
What 's the news abroad ?
Off with this Gown , I come to have thee walk .
No, good Tibullus , I 'm not now in Case ,
Pray ' let me alone .
How ?
not in case !
' Slight thou'rt in too much case , by all this Law .
Troth , if I live , I will new dress the Law ,
In sprightly Poesies habillaments .
The Hell thou wilt .
What , turn Law into Verse ?
Thy Father has school 'd thee , I see .
Here , read that same .
There 's subject for you : and if I mistake not ,
A Supersedeas to your melancholy .
How ! subscrib 'd Julia ! O , my Life , my Heaven !
Is the Mood chang 'd ?
Musick of Wit ! Note for th ' harmonious
Sphears !
Celestial Accents , how you ravish me !
What is it , Ovid ?
That I must meet my Julia , the Princess Julia .
Where ?
Why , at ? ?
Heart , I have forgot : my Pas -
sion so transports me .
I 'll save your pains : it is at Albius House ,
The Jewellers , where the fair Lycoris lyes .
Who ?
Cytheris , Cornelius Gallus Love ?
I , he 'll be there too , and my Plautia .
And why not your Delia ?
Yes , and your Corinna .
True , but my sweet Tibullus , keep that secret :
I would not , for all Rome , it should be thought ,
I vail bright Julia underneath that name :
Julia the Gem and Jewel of my Soul ,
That takes her Honours from the golden Sky ,
As Beauty doth all lustre from her Eye .
The Air respires the pure Elyzian Sweets
In which she breaths , and from Looks descend
The Glories of the Summer .
Heaven she is ,
Prais 'd in her self above all praise : and he
Which hears her speak , would swear the tuneful Orbes
Turn 'd in his Zenith only .
Publius , thou'lt lose
thy self .
O , in no Labyrinth can I safelier err ,
Than when I lose my self in praising her .
Hence Law , and welcom Muses ; though not rich ,
Yet are you pleasing : let 's be reconcil 'd ,
And now made one .
Henceforth , I promise faith ,
And all my serious hours to spend with you :
With you , whose Musick striketh on my Heart ,
And with bewitching tones steals forth my Spirit ,
In Julia 's name ; fair Julia : Julia 's Love
Shall be a Law , and that sweet Law I 'll study ,
The Law , and art of sacred Julia 's Love :
All other Objects will but Abjects prove .
Come , we shall have thee as passionate as Pro-
pertius , anon .
O , how does my Sextus ?
Faith , full of sorrow for his Cynthia 's death .
What , still ?
Still , and still more , his Griefs do grow upon him ,
As do his hours .
Never did I know
An understanding Spirit so take to heart
The common work of Fate .
O my Tibullus ,
Let us not blame him : for , against such chances ,
The heartiest strife of Vertue is not proof .
We may read Constancy and Fortitude
To other Souls : but had our selves been struck
With the like Planet , had our Loves ( like his )
Been ravisht from us by injurious Death ,
And in the height , and heat of our best days ,
It would have crackt our Sinnews , shrunk our Veins ,
And made our very Heart-strings jar , like his .
Come , let 's go take him forth , and prove , if mirth
Or Company will but abate his Passion .
Content , and I implore the Gods it may .
Stool , Sir . Your Cousin Cytheris will come down
We are so busie for the receiving of these
Courtiers here , that I can scarce be a Minute with my
self , for thinking of them : Pray you sit , Sir : Pray you
sit , Sir .
I am very well , Sir . Ne 're trust me , but you
are most delicately seated here , full of sweet delight and
blandishment ! an excellent Air , an excellent Air !
I , Sir , 'tis a pretty air .
These Courtiers run in
my mind still ; I must look out : for Jupiters sake , sit ,
Sir . Or please you walk into the Garden ?
There 's a
Garden on the back-side .
I am most strenuously well , I thank you , Sir .
Much good do you , Sir .
Come , bring those Perfumes forward a little ,
and strew some Roses and Violets here ; Fie , here be
Rooms favour the most pitifully rank that ever I felt : I
cry the Gods Mercy , my Husband 's in the wind of us .
Why this is good , excellent , excellent : well said ,
my sweet Chloe : Trim up your House most obsequi-
For Vulcan 's sake , breath somewhere else : in
troth you overcome our Perfumes exceedingly , you are
too predominant .
Hear but my opinion , sweet Wife .
A Pin for your opinion .
In sincerity , if you be
thus fulsome to me in every thing , I 'll be divorced ;
Gods my Body ?
you know what you were before I
married you ; I was a Gentlewoman born , I ; I lost all
my Friends to be a Citizens Wife , because I heard in-
deed , they kept their Wives as fine as Ladies ; and that
we might rule our Husbands like Ladies , and do what
we listed ; do you think I would have married you
else ?
I acknowledge , sweet Wife , she speaks the best
of any Woman in Italy , and moves as mightily : which
makes me , I had rather she should make Bumps on my
Head , as big as my two Fingers , than I would offend
But sweet Wife ? ?
Yet again ?
Is't not grace enough for you , that
I call you Husband , and you call me Wife : but you
must still be poking me , against my will , to things ?
But you know , Wife , here are the greatest La -
dies , and Gallantest Gentlemen of Rome , to be enter-
tain 'd in our House now : and I would fain advise thee ,
to entertain them in the best sort , i' faith , Wife .
In sincerity , did you ever hear a man talk so
idly ?
You would seem to be Master ?
you would have
your Spoke in my Cart ?
you would advise me to en-
tertain Ladies and Gentlemen ?
because you can mar-
shal your Pack-needles , Horse-combs , Hobby-Horses , and
Wall-candle-sticks in your Ware-house better than I ,
therefore you can tell how to entertain Ladies and Gen-
tlefolks better than I ?
O my sweet Wife , upbraid me not with that :
" Gain favours sweetly from any thing ; he that re -
spects to get , must relish all Commodities alike ; and
admit no difference betwixt Ode and Frankincense ; or
the most precious Balsamum and a Tar-barrel .
Marry fough : You sell Snuffers too , if you be
remembred , but I pray you let me buy them out of your
hand ; for I tell you true , I take it highly in Snuff , to
learn how to entertain Gentlefolks of you , at these
years i'faith .
Alas man , there was not a Gentleman
came to you house i' your t 'other Wives time , I hope ?
nor a Lady ?
nor Musick ?
nor Masks ?
Nor you , nor
your House were so much as spoken of , before I dis -
bast my self , from my Hood and my Farthingal , to these
Bum-rowls and your Whale-bone-Bodies .
Look here , my sweet Wife ; I am mum , my
dear Mummia , my Balsamum , my sperma cete , and my
very City of ? ?
she has the most best , true , feminine
wit in Rome !
I have heard so , Sir ; and do most vehemently
desire to participate the knowledge of her fair Features .
Ah , peace ; you shall hear more anon : be not
seen yet , I pray you ; not yet : observe .
Give Husbands the Head a little more , and they 'll
be nothing but Head shortly ; what 's he there ?
Maid 1 .
I know not , forsooth .
Maid 2.
Who would you speak with , Sir ?
I would speak with my Cousin Cytheris .
Maid 2.
He is one , forsooth , would speak with his
Cousin Cytheris .
Is she your Cousin , Sir ?
Yes in truth , forsooth , for fault of a better .
She is a Gentlewomau ?
Or else she should not be my Cousin , I assure
Are you a Gentleman born ?
That I am , Lady ; you shall see mine Arms , if't
please you .
No, your Legs do sufficiently shew you are a
Getleman born Sir : for a Man born upon little Legs , is
always a Gentleman born .
Yet , I pray you , vouchsafe the sight of my
Arms , Mistress ; for I bear them about me , to have 'em
seen : my name is Crispinus , or Cri-spinas indeed ; which
is well exprest in my Arms , ( a Face crying in Chief ; and
beneath it a bloody Toe , between three Thorns Pun-
Then you are welcome , Sir , now you are a
Gentleman born , I can find it my Heart to welcom you :
for I am Gentlewoman born too , and will bear my Head
high enough , though 'twere my fortune to marry a
No doubt of that , sweet Feature , your Carriage
shews it in any Mans Eye , that is carried upon you with
Dear Wife , be not angry .
God 's my Passion !
Hear me but one thing ; let not your Maids set
Cushions in the Parlor Windows ; nor in the Dining-
chamber Windows ; nor upon Stools , in either of them ,
in any case ; for 'tis Tavern-like ; but lay them one up -
on another , in some out-room or corner of the Dining-
Go , go , meddle with your Bed-chamber only ;
or rather with your Bed in your Chamber only ; or ra -
ther with your Wife in your Bed only ; or on my faith
I 'll not be pleas 'd with you only .
Look here , my dear Wife , entertain that Gentle -
man kindly , I pry 'thee ? ?
Go , I need your instructions indeed ; anger me
no more , I advise you .
Citi-sin , quoth'a ! she 's a wise
Gentlewoman y 'faith , will marry her self to the sin of
the City .
But this time , and no more ( by Heaven ) Wife :
hang no Pictures in the Hall , nor in the Dining-cham -
ber , in any case , but in the Gallery only , for 'tis not
courtly else , o ' my word , Wife .
'Sprecious , never have done !
Do I not bear a reasonable corrigible hand over
him , Crispinus ?
By this Hand , Lady , you hold a most sweet hand
over him .
And then for the great gilt Andirons ? ?
Again ! would the Andirons were in your great
Guts for me .
I do vanish Wife .
How shall I do , Master Crispinus ?
here will
be all the bravest Ladies in Court presently to see
your Cousin Cytheris : O the Gods ! how might I be-
have my self now , as to entertain them most
Courtly ?
Marry , Lady , if you will entertain them most
Courtly , you must do thus : as soon as ever your Maid
or your Man brings you word they are come ; you must
say ( A Pox on 'em , what do they here ? )
And yet when
they come , speak them as fair , and give them the
kindest Welcome in words , that can be .
Is that the fashion of Courtiers , Crispinus ?
I assure you , it is , Lady , I have observ 'd it .
For your Pox , Sir , it is easily hit on ; but 'tis
not so easie to speak fair after methinks .
O Wife , the Coaches are come , on my word , a
number of Coaches and Courtiers .
A Pox on them , what do they here ?
How now Wife ! would 'st thou not have 'em
come ?
Come ?
come , you are a Fool , you : He knows
not the trick on't .
Call Cytheris , I pray you : and good
Master Crispinus , you can observe , you say ; let me
entreat you for all the Ladies Behaviours , Jewels , Jests ,
and Attires , that you marking as well as I , we may put
both our marks together , when they are gone , and con-
fer of them .
I warrant you , sweet Lady ; let me alone to
observe , till I turn my self to nothing but observation .
Good morrow Cousin Cytheris .
Welcome kind Cousin .
What ?
are they come ?
I your Friend Cornelius Gallus , Ovid , Tibullus ,
Propertius , with Julia the Emperors Daughter , and the
Lady Plautia , are lighted at the Door ; and with them
Hermogenes Tigellius , the cxcellent Musician .
Come , let us go meet them , Chloe .
Observe , Chrispinus .
At a Hairs breadth , Lady , I warrant you .
HEalth to the lovely Chloe : you must pardon me ,
Mistress , that I prefer this fair Gentlewoman .
I pardon , and praise you for it , Sir ; and I be-
seech your Excellence , receive her Beauties into your
knowledge and favour .
Cytheris , she hath favour , and behaviour , that
commands as much of me : and sweet Chloe , know I
do exceedingly love you , and that I will approve in a -
ny Grace my Father the Emperor may shew you .
Is
this your Husband ?
For fault of a better , if it please your Highness .
Gods my life ! how he shames me !
Not a whit , Chloe , they all think you politick ,
and witty ; wise Women chuse not Husbands for the
Eye , Merit , or Birth , but Wealth and Sovereignty .
Sir , we all come to gratulate , for the good re -
port of you .
And would be glad to deserve your Love , Sir .
My Wife will answer you all , Gentlemen ; I 'll
come to you again presently .
You have chosen you a most fair Companion
here , Cytheris , and a very fair House .
To both which , you and all my Friends are ve-
ry welcome , Plautia .
With all my heart , I assure your Ladiship .
Thanks , sweet Mistress Chloe .
You must needs come to Court , Lady , i'faith ,
and there be sure your welcome shall be as great to us .
She will deserve it , Madam .
I see , even in
her Looks , Gentry , and general Worthiness .
I have not seen a more certain Character of an
excellent disposition .
O , they do so commend me here , the Courti-
ers ! what 's the matter now ?
For the Banquet sweet Wife .
Yes ; and I must needs come to Court , and be
welcome , the Princess says .
Ovid , and Tibullus , you may be bold to welcome
your Mistresses here .
We find it so , Sir .
And thank Cornelius Gallus .
Nay , my sweet Sextus , in faith thou art not
In faith , I am not , Publius ; nor I cannot .
Sick minds , are like sick men that burn with Feavers ,
Who when they drink , please but a present taste ,
And after bear a more impatient fit .
Pray let me leave you ; I offend you all ,
And my self most .
Stay , sweet Propertius .
You yield too much unto your griefs , and fate ,
Which never hurts , but when we say it hurts us .
O peace Tibullus ; your Philosophy
Lends you too rough a hand to search my Wounds .
Speak they of griefs , that know to sigh and grieve ?
The free and unconstrained spirit feels
No weight of my Oppression .
Worthy Roman !
Methinks I taste his Misery , and could
Sit down , and chide at his malignant Stars .
Methinks I love him , that he loves so truly .
This is the perfect 'st love , lives after death .
Such is the constant ground of vertue still .
It puts on an inseperable Face .
have you mark't every thing , Crispinus ?
Every thing , I warrant you .
What Gentlemen are these ?
do you know them ?
I , they are Poets , Lady .
Poets ?
they did not talk of me since I went , did
they ?
O yes , and extoll 'd your Perfections to the
Now in sincerity , they be the finest kind of men
that ever I knew : Poets ?
Could not one get the Empe-
ror to make my Husband a Poet , think you ?
No, Lady , 'tis Love , and Beauty make Poets :
and since you like Poets so well , your Love and Beau -
ties shall make me a Poet .
What , shall they ?
and such a one as these ?
I , and a better than these : I would be sorry else ?
And shall your Looks change ?
and your Hair
change ?
and all like these ?
Why , a Man may be a Poet , and yet not change
his Hair , Lady .
Well , we shall see your cunning : yet if you can
change your Hair , I pray do .
Ladies , and Lordings , there 's a slight Banquet
stays within for you , please you draw near , and accost it .
We thank you , good Albius : but when shall we
see those excellent Jewels you are commended to have ?
At your Ladiships Service .
I got that Speech by
seeing a Play last day , and it did me some Grace now :
I see , 'tis good to collect sometimes ; I 'll frequent these
Plays more than I have done , now I come to be familiar
with Courtiers .
Why , how now , Hermogenes ?
what ailest thou
trow ?
A little Melancholy , let me alone , pr'y thee .
Melancholy ! how so ?
With riding : a Plague on all Coaches for me .
Is that hard-favour 'd Gentleman a Poet too ;
Cytheris ?
No, this is Hermogenes , as humorous as a Poet
though : he is a Musician .
A Musician ?
then he can sing .
That he can excellently ; did you never hear
him ?
O no : will he be entreated , think you ?
I know not .
Friend , Mistress Chloe would
fain hear Hermogenes sing : Are you interested in
him ?
No doubt , his own Humanity will command
him so far , to the satisfaction of so fair a Beauty ;
but rather than fail , wee 'll all be Suiters to him .
' Cannot sing .
Pr'y thee , Hermogenes .
' Cannot sing .
For honour of this Gentlewoman , to whose
House , I know thou maist be ever welcome .
That
That he shall in truth , Sir , if he can sing .
What 's that ?
This Gentlewoman is wooing Hermogenes for a
A Song ?
come , he shall not deny her .
Her-
mogenes ?
' Cannot sing .
No, the Ladies must do it , he stays but to have
their Thanks acknowledg 'd as a Debt to his Cunning .
That shall not want : our self will be the first shall
promise to pay him more than thanks , upon a favour so
worthily vouchsaf't .
Thank you , Madam , but 'will not sing .
Tut , the only way to win him , is to abstain from
intreating him .
Do you love singing , Lady ?
O , passingly .
Intreat the Ladies , to intreat me to sing then , I
beseech you .
I beseech your Grace , intreat this Gentleman to
That we will , Chloe ; can he sing excellently ?
I think so , Madam : for he intreated me , to in-
treat you , to intreat him to sing .
Heaven and Earth ! would you tell that ?
Good Sir , let 's intreat you to use your Voice .
Alas , Madam , I cannot in truth .
The Gentleman is modest : I warrant you , he
sings excellently .
Hermogenes , clear your Throat : I see by him ,
here 's a Gentleman will worthily challenge you .
Not I , Sir , I 'll challenge no Man .
That 's your modesty , Sir : but we , out of an
assurance of your excellency , challenge him in your be-
I thank you , Gentlemen , I 'll do my best .
Let that best be good , Sir , you were best .
O , this contention is excellent .
What is't you
sing , Sir ?
If I freely may discover , &c .
Sir , I 'll sing that .
One of your own Compositions , Hermogenes .
He offers you vantage enough .
Nay truly , Gentleman , I 'll challenge no Man ? :
I can sing but one Staff of the Ditty neither .
The better : Hermogenes himself will be intreated
to sing the other .
S O N G.
IF I freely may discover
What would please me in my Lover :
I would have her fair and witty ,
Savouring more of Court than City ;
A little proud , but full of pity :
Light and humorous in her toying ,
Oft building hopes , and soon destroying ;
Long , but sweet in the enjoying ;
Neither too easie , nor too hard :
All extreams I would have barr 'd .
Believe me , Sir , you sing most excellently .
If there were a Praise above Excellence , the
Gentleman highly deserves it .
Sir , all this doth not yet make me envy you :
for I know I sing better than you .
Attend Hermogenes , now .
I I.
She should be allowed her passions ,
So they were but us 'd as Fashions ;
Sometimes froward , and then frowning ,
Sometimes sickish , and then swooning ,
Every Fit with change still crowning .
Purely jealous , I would have her ,
Then only constant when I crave her .
' Tis a Vertue should not save her .
Thus , nor her delicates would cloy me ,
Neither her peevishness annoy me .
Nay , Hermogenes , your Merit hath long since
been both known , and admir 'd of us .
You shall hear me sing another : now will I
We shall do this Gentlemans Banquet too much
wrong , that stays for us , Ladies .
' Tis true : and well thought on , Cornelius Gallus .
Why 'tis but a short Air , 'twill be done present -
ly , pray ' stay ; strike Musick .
No, good Hermogenes : we 'll end this difference
' Tis the common Disease of all your Musicians ,
that they know no mean , to be intreated either to begin
or end .
Please you lead the way , Gentiles ?
Thanks , good Albius .
O , what a Charm of Thanks was here put upon
me ! O Jove , what a setting forth it is to a Man , to have
many Courtiers come to his House ! Sweetly was it said
of a good old House-keeper ; I had rather want Meat
than want Guests : especially if they be courtly Guests .
For , never trust me , if one of their good Legs made
in a House , be not worth all the good Chear a Man can
make them .
He that would have fine Guests , let him
have a fine Wife ; he that would have a fine Wife , let
him come to me .
By your kind leave , Master Albius .
What , you are not gone , Master Crispinus ?
Yes faith , I have a design draws me hence :
pray ' Sir , fashion me an Excuse to the Ladies .
Will you not stay , and see the Jewels , Sir ?
Ipray you stay .
Not for a Million , Sir , now .
Let it suffice , I
must relinquish ; and so in a word , please you to ex -
piate this Complement .
I 'll presently go and enghle some Broker , for a
Poets Gown , and bespeak a Garland : and then Jeweller ,
look to your best Jewel y ' faith .
yes ; I will begin an Ode so : and it shall be
to Mec?nas .
' Slid , yonder 's Horace ! they say he 's an
excellent Poet : Mec?nus
loves him .
I 'll fall into his ac -
quaintance , if I can ; I think he be composing as he
goes i' the Street ! ha ?
'tis a good humour , if he be :
I 'll compose too .
Swell me a Bowl with lusty Wine ,
Till I may see the plump Ly?us swim
Above the brim :
I drink , as I would write ,
In flowing measure , fill 'd with flame and sprite .
Sweet Horace , Minerva , and the Muses stand au-
spicious to thy designs .
How far 'st thou , sweet Man ?
Frolick ?
Rich ?
Gallant ?
ha ?
Not greatly Gallant , Sir , like my Fortunes ;
I am bold to take my leave , Sir , you 'll nought else , Sir ,
would you ?
Troth , no , but I could wish thou did 'st know us
Horace , we are a Schollar , I assure thee .
A Schollar , Sir ?
I shall be covetous of your fair
Gramercy , good Horace .
Nay we are new turn 'd
Poet too , which is more ; and a Satyrist too , which is
more than that : I write just in thy vein , I.
I am for
your Odes or your Sermones , or any thing indeed ; we
are a Gentleman besides : our name is Rufus Laberius
Crispinus , we are a pretty Stoick too .
To the proportion of your Beard , I think it ,
By Ph?bus ,
here 's a most neat fine Street , is't not ?
I protest to thee , I am enamour 'd of this Street now ,
more than of half the Streets of Rome again ; 'tis so polite ,
and terse ! There 's the Front of a Building now .
I stu-
dy Architecture too : if ever I should build , I'ld have a
House just of that Prospective .
Doubtless , this Gallants Tongue has a good turn ,
when he sleeps .
I do make Verses , when I come in such a Street
as this : O your City-Ladies , you shall ha' 'em sit in e-
very Shop like the Muses ?
off'ring you the Castalian
Dews , and the Thespian Liquors , to as many as have but
the sweet Grace and Audacity to ?
sip of their Lips .
Did you never hear any of my Verses ?
No, Sir ( but I am in some fear I must now . )
I 'll tell the some ( if I can but recover 'em ) I
compos 'd e 'en now of a dressing , I saw a Jewellers
Wife wear , who indeed was a Jewel her self : I prefer
that kind of Tire now , what 's thy opinion , Horace ?
With your Silver Bodkin , it does well , Sir .
I cannot tell , but it stirs me more than all your
Court-curls , or your Spangles , or your Tricks : I affect
not these high Gable-ends , these Tuscane Tops , nor your
Coronets , nor your Arches , nor your Pyramid 's ; give
me a fine sweet ?
little delicate dressing with a Bod -
kin , as you say : and a Mushrome , for all your other
Is't not possible to make an escape from him ?
I have remitted my Verses , all this while , I think ,
I ha' forgot 'em .
Here 's he , could wish you had else .
Pray Jove , I can entreat 'em of my Memory .
You put your memory to too much trouble , Sir .
No sweet Horace , we must not have thee think
I cry you mercy ; then , they are my Ears
That must be tortur 'd : well , you must have patience
Pray thee , Horace , observe .
Yes , Sir : your Sattin Sleeve begins to fret at the
Rug that is underneath it , I do observe : And your ample
velvet Bases are not without evident stains of a hot dis -
position naturally .
O ?
I 'll dye them into another Colour , at plea -
sure : how many yards of Velvet dost thou think they
contain ?
I have put him now in a fresh way
To vex me more : Faith , Sir , your Mercers Book
Will tell you with more patience , than I can .
( For I am crost , and so 's not that , I think . )
' Slight , these Verses have lost me again : I shall
not invite 'em to mind , now .
Rack not your thoughts , good Sir ; rather defer it
To a new time ; I 'll meet you at your Lodging ,
Or where you please : Till then , Jove keep you , Sir .
Nay , gentle Horace , stay ; I have it , now .
Yes , Sir . Apollo , Hermes , Jupiter , look down up -
on me .
Rich was thy hap , sweet dainty Cap ,
There to be placed :
Where thy smooth black , sleek white may smack ,
And both be graced .
White is there usurpt for her Brow ; her Fore-head : and
then sleek , as the paralel to smooth , that went before .

kind of Paranomasie , or Agnomination : do you conceive ,
Sir ?
Troth , Sir , I must be abrupt and leave
Why what haste hast thou ?
pr'y thee stay a lit-
tle ; thou shalt not go yet , by Ph?bus .
Hor , I shall not ?
what Remedy ?
Fie , how I sweat
with Suffering !
And then ?
Pray , Sir , give me leave to wipe my Face a
Yes , do , good Horace .
Thank you , Sir .
Death ! I must crave his leave to piss anon ;
Or that I may go hence with half my Teeth :
I am in some such fear .
This Tyranny
Is strange , to take mine Ears up by Commission ,
( Whether I will or no ) and make them Stalls
To his lewd Solecisms , and worded Trash .
Happy thou , bold Bolanus , now I say ;
Whose freedom , and impatience of this fellow ,
Would long ere this , have call 'd him Fool , and Fool ,
And rank , and tedious Fool , and have slung Jests
As hard as Stones , till thou hadst pelted him
Out of the place : whil 'st my tame Modesty
Suffers my Wit be made a solemn Ass
To bear his Fopperies ?
Horace , thou art miserably affected to be gone ,
I see .
But ?
pr'y thee , let 's prove to enjoy thee a while .
Thou hast no business , I assure me .
Whether is thy
journey directed ?
ha ?
Sir , I am going to visit a friend that 's sick .
A Friend ?
What 's he ?
do not I know him ?
No, Sir , you do not know him ; and 'tis not the
worse for him .
What 's his Name ?
where 's he lodg 'd ?
Where I shall be fearful to draw you out of
your way , Sir ; a great way hence ; pray ' , Sir , let 's
Nay , but where is't ?
I pr'y thee , say .
On the far side of all Tyber yonder , by C?sars
O that 's my course directly ; I am for you .
Come go ; why stand 'st thou ?
Yes , Sir : marry the Plague is in that part of
the City ; I had almost forgot to tell you , Sir .
Fough , it is no matter , I fear no Pestilence , I
ha' not offended Ph?bus .
I have , it seems , or else this heavy Scourge
Could ne 'er have lighted on me ?
Come , along .
I am to go down some half mile , this way , Sir ,
first , to speak with his Physician : And from thence to
his Apothecary , where I shall stay the mixing of divers
Drugs ? ?
Why , it 's all one , I have nothing to do , and I
love not to be idle , I 'll bear thee company .
How call 'st
thou the Apothecary ?
O that I knew a name would fright him now .
Sir Rhadamanthus , Rhadamanthus , Sir .
There 's one so call 'd , is a just Judge in Hell ,
And doth inflict strange Vengeance on all those ,
That ( here on Earth ) torment poor patient Spirits .
He dwells at the three Furies , by Janus 's
Temple ?
Your ' Pothecary does , Sir .
Heart , I owe him Money for Sweet-meats , and
he has laid to arrest me , I hear : but ?
Sir , I have made a most solemn vow , I will
never bail any Man .
Well then , I 'll swear , and speak him fair , if the
worst come .
But his name is Minos , not Rhadaman-
thus , Horace .
That
That may be , Sir : I but guess 'd at his Name by
his Sign .
But your Minos is a Judge too , Sir ?
I protest to thee , Horace , ( do but taste me once )
if I do know my self , and mine own Vertues truly , thou
wilt not make that esteem of Varius , or Virgil , or Tibul-
lus , or any of 'em indeed , as now in thy ignorance thou
dost ; which I am content to forgive : I would fain see
which of these could pen more Verses in a day , or with
more facility , than I ; or that could court his Mistris ,
kiss her Hand , make better sport with her Fan , or her
Dog ? ?
I cannot bail you yet , Sir .
Or that could move his Body more gracefully ,
or dance better : You should see me , were it not i' the
Street ? ?
Nor yet .
Why , I have been a Reveller , and at my Cloth
of Silver Sute , and my long Stocking , in my time , and
will be again ? ?
If you may be trusted , Sir .
And then for my singing , Hermogenes himself
envies me , that is your only Master of Musick you have
in Rome .
Is your Mother living , Sir ?
Au : Convert thy Thoughts to somewhat else ,
I pray thee .
You have much of the Mother in you , Sir :
Your Father is dead ?
I , I thank Jove , and my Grandfather too , and
all my Kinsfolks , and well compos 'd in their Urns .
The more their happiness , that rest in peace ,
Free from th ' abundant Torture of thy Tongue :
Would I were with them too .
What 's that , Horace ?
I now remember me , Sir , of a sad Fate
A Cunning Woman , one Sabella , sung ,
When in her Urn she cast my Destiny ,
I being but a Child .
What was't , I pray thee ?
She told me I should surely never perish
By Famine , Poison , or the Enemies Sword ;
The Hectick Fever , Cough , or Pleurisie
Should never hurt me , nor the tardy Gout :
But in my time I should be once surpriz 'd
By a strong tedious Talker , that should vex
And almost bring me to Consumption :
Therefore , ( if I were wise ) she war n 'd me shun
All such long-winded Monsters , as my Bane :
For if I could but scape that one Discourser ,
I might ( no doubt ) prove an old aged man .
By your leave , Sir .
Tut , tut ; abandon this idle Humour , 'tis nothing
but Melancholy .
' Fore Jove , now I think on't , I am to
appear in Court here , to answer to one that has me in
Suit : Sweet Horace , go with me , this is my Hour ; if I
neglect it , the Law proceeds against me .
Thou art fa -
miliar with these things ; pr'y thee , if thou lov'st me , go .
Now , let me die , Sir , if I know your Laws ,
Or have the power to stand still half so long
In their loud Courts , as while a Case is argued .
Besides , you know , Sir , where I am to go ,
And the necessity ? ?
' Tis true : ?
I hope the Hour of my Release be come : He
will (upon this Consideration ) discharge me , sure .
Troth , I am doubtful what I may best do ; whe-
ther to leave thee , or my Affairs , Horace .
O Jupiter ! me , Sir , me , by any means : I beseech
you , me , Sir .
No faith , I 'll venture those now ; thou shalt see I
love thee : Come , Horace .
Nay , then I am desperate : I follow you , Sir .
' Tis hard contending with a Man that overcomes thus .
And how deals Mec?nas
with thee ?
liberally ?
ha ?
Is he open-handed ?
bountiful ?
He 's still himself , Sir .
Troth , Horace , thou art exceeding happy in thy
Friends and Acquaintance ; they are all most choice
Spirits , and of the first Rank of Romans : I do not know
that Poet , I protest , has us 'd his Fortune more prospe-
rously than thou hast .
If thou wouldst bring me known
to Mec?nas ,
I should second thy Desert well ; thou
shouldst find a good sure Assistant of me , one that
would speak all good of thee in thy absence , and be
content with the next Place , not envying thy Reputa -
tion with thy Patron .
Let me not live , but I think
thou and I ( in a small time ) should lift them all out of
Favour , both Virgil , Varius , and the best of them , and
enjoy him wholly to our selves .
Gods , you do know it , I can hold no longer ;
This Brize hath prickt my Patience : Sir , your Silkness
Clearly mistakes Mec?nas ,
and his House ,
To think there breaths a Spirit beneath his Roof
Subject unto those poor Affections
Of undermining Envy and Detraction ,
Moods only proper to base groveling Minds .
That Place is not in Rome , I dare affirm ,
More pure or free from such low common Evils .
There 's no man griev 'd , that this is thought more rich ,
Or this more learned ; each man hath his Place ,
And to his Merit his Reward of Grace :
Which with a mutual Love they all embrace .
You report a Wonder ! 'tis scarce credible , this .
I am no Torture , to enforce you to believe it ;
but 'tis so .
Why , this enflames me with a more ardent de-
sire to be his , than before : but I doubt I shall find the
entrance to his Familiarity somewhat more than difficult ,
Tut , you 'll conquer him , as you have done me :
There 's no standing out against you , Sir , I see that : Ei-
ther your Importunity , or the intimation of your good
Parts , or ? ?
Nay , I 'll bribe his Porter , and the Grooms of his
Chamber , make his Doors open to me that way first ;
and then I 'll observe my Times .
Say he should extrude
me his House to day , shall I therefore desist , or let fall
my Suit to morrow ?
No ; I 'll attend him , follow him ,
meet him i' the Street , the High-ways , run by his Coach ,
never leave him .
What ?
Man hath nothing given him
in this Life , without much Labour .
And Impudence .
Archer of Heaven , Ph?bus ,
take thy Bow ,
And with a full drawn Shaft nail to the Earth
This Python , that I may yet run hence , and live :
Or brawny Hercules , do thou come down ,
And ( though thou mak 'st it up thy Thirteenth Labour )
Rescue me from this Hydra of Discourse here .
O welcome , my Reliever ;
Aristius , as thou lov'st me , ransom me .
What ail 'st thou , Man ?
' Death , I am seis 'd on here
By a Land-Remora ; I cannot stir ,
Not move , but as he pleases .
Wilt thou go , Horace ?
Heart ! He cleaves to me like Alcides Shirt ,
Tearing my Flesh and Sinews : O , I ha' been vext
And tortur 'd with him , beyond forty Fevers .
For Jove 's sake , find some means to take me from him .
Yes , I will : but I 'll go first and tell Mec?nas .
Come , shall we go ?
The Jest will make his Eyes run , i' faith .
Nay , Aristius ?
Farewell , Horace .
' Death ! will a' leave me ?
Fuscus Aristius , do
you hear ?
Gods of Rome ! You said , you had some-
what to say to me in private .
I , but I see you are now employ 'd with that
P Gentleman ;
Gentleman ; 'twere Offence to trouble you : I 'll take
some fitter Opportunity : Farewell .
Mischief and Torment ! O my Soul and Heart ,
How are you crampt with Anguish ! Death it self
Brings not the like Convulsions .
O , this day ,
That ever I should view thy tedious face ? ?
Horace , what Passion , what Humour is this ?
Away , good Prodigie afflict me not .
( A Friend , and mock me thus ! ) Never was man
So left under the Ax ? ?
How now ?
Ash-colour 'd Feather : His Name is Laberius Cri-
Laberius Crispinus , I arrest you in the Emperor 's
Me , Sir ?
do your arrest me ?
I , Sir , at the Suit of Master Minos the ' Po-
Thanks , great Apollo : I will not slip thy Favour
offered me in my Escape , for my Fortunes .
Master Minos ?
I know no Master Minos .
Where 's
Horace ?
Horace , Horace .
Sir , do not you know me ?
O yes , I know you , Master Minos ; cry you
But Horace ?
Gods me , is he gone ?
I , and so would you too , if you knew how .
Officer , look to him .
Do you hear , Master Minos ?
Pray let 's be us 'd
like a Man of our own Fashion .
By Janus and Jupiter ,
I meant to have paid you next Week , every Drachm .
Seek not to eclipse my Reputation thus vulgarly .
Sir , your Oaths cannot serve you ; you know
I have forborn you long .
I am conscious of it , Sir . Nay , I beseech you ,
Gentlemen , do not exhale me thus ; remember 'tis but
for Sweet-meats ?
Sweet Meat must have sowr Sauce , Sir . Come
Sweet Master Minos , I am forfeited to eternal
Disgrace , if you do not commiserate .
Good Officer ,
be not so officious .
WHy , how now , my good brace of Blood-hounds ?
Whither do you drag the Gentleman ?
You
Mungrels , you Curs , you Bandogs ; we are Captain
Tucca that talk to you , you inhumane Pilchers .
Sir , he is their Prisoner .
Their Pestilence ! What are you , Sir ?
A Citizen of Rome , Sir .
Then you are not far distant from a Fool , Sir .
A Pothecary , Sir .
I knew thou wast not a Physician ; fough ; out
of my Nostrils , thou stink 'st of Lotium and the Syringe :
away , Quacksalver .
Follower , my Sword .
Here , noble Leader , you 'll do no harm with it :
I 'll trust you .
Do you hear , you Good-man Slave ?
Hook , Ram ,
Rogue , Catch-pole , loose the Gentleman , or by my Vel-
vet Arms ? ?
What will you do , Sir ?
Tuc , Kiss thy Hand , my honourable active Varlet ,
and embrace thee thus .
O patient Metamorphosis !
My Sword , my tall Rascal .
Nay , soft , Sir : Some wiser than some .
What ?
and a Wit too ! By Pluto , thou must be
cherish 'd , Slave ; here 's three Drachms for thee ; hold .
There 's half his Lendings gone .
Give me .
No, Sir , your first Word shall stand : I 'll hold all .
Nay , but , Rogue ? ?
You would make a Rescue of our Prisoner , Sir ,
I a Rescue ?
Away , inhumane Varlet .
Come ,
come , I never rellish above one Jest at most ; do not
disgust me , Sirrah , do not : Rogue , I tell thee , Rogue ,
do not .
How , Sir ?
Rogue ?
I , why ! Thou art not angry , Rascal , art thou ?
I cannot tell , Sir ; I am little better , upon these
Ha ! Gods and Friends ! Why , dost hear , Rogue
thou ?
give me thy Hand ; I say unto thee , thy Hand ,
What , dost not thou know me ?
not me , Rogue ?
not Captain Tucca , Rogue ?
Come pra' surrender the Gentleman his Sword ,
Officer ; we 'll have no fighting here .
What 's thy Name ?
Minos , an't please you .
Minos ?
Come hither , Minos ; thou art a wise
Fellow , it seems ; let me talk with thee .
Was ever Wretch so wretched as unfortunate I ?
Thou art one of the Centum-viri , old Boy , art
not ?
No indeed , Master Captain .
Go to , thou shalt be then ; I 'll ha' thee one , Mi-
Take my Sword from those Rascals , dost thou see ?
go , do it ; I cannot attempt with patience .
What do 's
this Gentleman owe thee , little Minos ?
Fourscore Sesterties , Sir .
What , no more ?
Come , thou shalt release him ,
Minos : What , I 'll be his Bail , thou shalt take my Word ,
old Boy , and cashire these Furies : Thou shalt do 't , I
say , thou shalt , little Minos , thou shalt .
Yes ; and as I am a Gentleman , and a Reveller ,
I 'll make a Piece of Poetry , and absolve all , within
these five days .
Come , Minos is not to learn how to use a Gent'-
man of Quality , I know : My Sword : If he pay thee
not , I will , and I must , old Boy .
Thou shalt be my
' Pothecary too .
Hast good Eringo 's , Minos ?
The best in Rome , Sir .
Go to then ? ?
Vermine , know the House .
I warrant you , Colonel .
For this Gentleman , Minos ?
I 'll take your Word , Captain .
Thou hast it .
My Sword ?
Yes , Sir : But you must discharge the Arrest ,
Master Crispinus .
How , Minos ?
Look in the Gentleman 's Face ,
and but read his Silence .
Pay , pay ; 'tis Honour , Minos .
By Jove , sweet Captain , you do most infinitely
endear and oblige me to you .
Tut , I cannot complement , by Mars ; but Jupi-
ter love me , as I love good Words , and good Clothes , and
there 's an end .
Thou shalt give my Boy that Girdle and
Hangers , when thou hast worn them a little more ?
O Jupiter ! Captain , he shall have them now
presently : Please you to be acceptive , young Gentleman .
Yes , Sir , fear not ; I shall accept ; I have a pretty
foolish humour of taking , if you knew all .
Not now , you shall not take , Boy .
By my truth , and earnest , but he shall , Captain ,
by your leave .
Nay , and a' swear by his truth , and earnest , take
it , Boy : do not make a Gent 'man forsworn .
Well , Sir , there 's your Sword ; but thank Master
Minos ; you had not carried it as you do else .
Minos
Minos is just , and you are Knaves , and ? ?
What say you , Sir ?
Pass on , my good Scoundrel , pass on , I honour
thee : But that I hate to have action with such base
Rogues as these , you should ha' seen me unrip their No-
ses now , and have sent 'em to the next Barbers to stich -
ing : for , do you see ?
I am a Man of Humour , and
I do love the Varlets , the honest Varlets they have Wit
and Valour , and are indeed good profitable ?
errant
Rogues , as any live in an Empire .
Dost thou hear Poe-
taster ?
second me .
Stand up ( Minos ) close , gather , yet ,
Sir , ( thou shalt have a Quarter-share , be resolute )
you shall , at my request , take Minos by the Hand here ,
little Minos , I will have it so ; all Friends , and a Health :
be not inexorable .
And thou shalt impart the Wine , old
Boy , thou shalt do 't , little Minos , thou shalt ; make us
pay it in our Physick .
What ?
we must live , and ho-
nour the Gods sometimes ; now Bacchus , now Comus , now
Priapus ; every God a little .
What 's he that stalks by
there , Boy , Pyrgus ?
You were best let him pass , Sirrah ;
do , Ferret , let him pass , do .
' Tis a Player , Sir .
A Player ?
Call him , call the lowsie Slave hi-
ther : What , will he sail by , and not once strike , or vail
to a Man of War ?
ha ?
Do you hear ?
you Player ,
Rogue , Stalker , come back here : No respect to Men of
Worship , you Slave ?
What , you are proud , you Rascal ,
are your proud ?
ha ?
You grow rich , do you , and purchase ,
you two-peny Tear-mouth ?
You have Fortune , and the
good Year on your side , you Stinkard , you have , you have .
Nay , sweet Captain , be confin 'd to some Rea -
son ; I protest I saw you not , Sir .
You did not ?
Where was your sight , Oedipus ?
You walk with Hares Eyes do you ?
I 'll ha' 'em glaz 'd ,
Rogue ; and you say the word , they shall be glaz 'd for
you : Come , we must have you turn Fidler again , Slave ,
get a Base Violin at your back , and march in a Tawny
Coat , with one Sleeve , to Goose-Fair ; then you 'll
know us , you 'll see us then , you will , Gulch , you will .
Then , Will 't please your Worship to have any Musick ,
Captain ?
Nay , good Captain .
What , do you laugh , Owleglas ?
Death , you per-
stemptuous Varlet , I am none of your Fellows : I have
commanded a hundred and fifty such Rogues , I.
1 Pyr .
I , and most of that hundred and fifty have
been Leaders of a Legion .
If I have exhibited wrong , I 'll tender Satisfacti-
on , Captain .
Saist thou so , honest Vermin ?
Give me thy
Hand ; thou shalt make us a Supper one of these Nights .
When you please , by Jove , Captain , most wil-
Dost thou swear ?
To morrow then ; say and
hold , Slave .
There are some of you Players honest
Gent 'men-like Scoundrels , and suspected to ha' some
Wit , as well as your Poets , both at Drinking , and break -
ing of Jests , and are Companions for Gallants .
A man
may skelder ye , now and then , of half a dozen Shil-
lings , or so .
Dost thou not know that Pantalabus there ?
No, I assure you , Captain .
Go , and be acquainted with him then ; he is a
Gent 'man , parcel Poet , you Slave ; his Father was a
Man of Worship , I tell thee .
Go , he pens high , lofty ,
in a new stalking Strain , bigger than half the Rhimers
i' the Town again : He was born to fill thy Mouth ,
Minotaurus , he was ; he will teach thee to tear and
Rascal , to him , cherish his Muse , go ; thou hast
forty , forty , Shillings , I mean , Stinkard ; give him
in earnest , do , he shall write for thee , Slave .
If he pen
for thee once , thou shalt not need to travel with thy
Pumps full of Gravel any more , after a blind Jade and
a Hamper , and stalk upon Boards and Barrel-heads to
an old crackt Trumpet ? ?
Troth , I think I ha' not so much about me ,
It 's no matter ; give him what thou hast : Stiff -
toe , I 'll give my Word for the rest ; though it lack a
Shilling or two , it skills not : Go , thou art an honest
Shifter ; I 'll ha' the Statute repeal 'd for thee .
Minos , I must
tell thee , Minos , thou hast dejected yon Gent 'mans Spirit
exceedingly ?
Dost observe , dost note , little Minos ?
Yes , Sir .
Go to then , raise , recover , do : Suffer him not
to droop , in prospect of a Player , a Rogue , a Stager :
Put twenty into his Hand , twenty Sesterces , I mean , and
let no body see : Go , do it , the Work shall commend it
self ; be Minos , I 'll pay .
Yes forsooth , Captain .
2 Pyr .
Do not we serve a notable Shark ?
And what new Matters have we now afoot ,
Sirrah ?
ha ?
I would fain come with my Cockatrice
one day , and see a Play , if I knew when there were
a good bawdy one ; but they say , you ha' nothing but
Humours , Revels , and Satyrs , that gird and fart at the
time , you Slave .
No, I assure you , Captain , not we .
They are
on the other side of Tyber : We have as much Ribaldry
in our Plays as can be , as you would wish , Captain :
All the Sinners i' the Suburbs come , and applaud our
of Copper-lac't Scoundrels of you : Life of Pluto! an'
you Stage me , Stinkard , your Mansions shall sweat
for't , your Tabernacles , Varlets , your Globes , and your
Not we , by Ph?bus ,
Captain ; do not do us im -
putation , without desert .
I wu'not , my good two-peny Rascal ; reach me
thy Neuf .
Dost hear ?
What wilt thou give me a Week
for my brace of Beagles here , my little Point-trussers ?
You shall ha' them act among ye .
Sirrah , you , pro-
Thou shalt hear him speak in King Darius
doleful Strain .
1 Pyr .
O doleful Days ! O direful deadly Dump !
O wicked World , and worldly Wickedness !
How can I hold my Fist from crying , Thump ,
In rue of this right raskal Wretchedness !
In an amorous Vein now , Sirrah : Peace .
1 Pyr .
O , she is wilder , and more hard , withal ,
Than Beast , or Bird , or Tree , or stony Wall .
Yet might she love me , to uprear her State :
I , but perhaps she hopes some nobler Mate .
Yet might she love me , to content her Fire :
I , but her Reason masters her Desire .
Yet might she love me as her Beauties Thrall :
I , but I fear , she cannot love at all .
Now , the horrible fierce Soldier , you , Sirrah .
1 Pyr .
What ?
will I brave thee ?
I , and Beard thee too .
A Roman Spirit scorns to bear a Brain
So full of base Pusillanimity .
Nay , thou shalt see that shall ravish thee anon ;
prick up thine Ears , Stinkard : The Ghost , Boys .
1 Pyr .
2 Pyr .
1 Pyr .
2 Pyr .
1 Pyr .
2 Pyr .
Now thunder , Sirrah , you , the rumbling
1 Pyr .
I , but some body must cry ( Murder ) then in a
small voice .
Your Fellow-sharer there shall do 't : Cry , Sirrah ,
1 Pyr .
Murder , murder .
P 2 2 Pyr .
2 Pyr .
Who calls out Murder ?
Lady , was it you ?
O , admirable good , I protest .
Sirrah , Boy , brace your Drum a little straiter ,
and do the t 'other Fellow there , he in the ?
what sha'
call him ? ?
and yet stay too .
2 Pyr .
Nay , and thou dalliest , then I am thy Foe ,
And Fear shall force what Friendship cannot win ;
Thy Death shall bury what thy Life conceals ,
Villain ! thou diest , for more respecting her ? ?
1 Pyr .
O , stay my Lord .
2 Pyr .
Than me :
Yet speak the Truth , and I will guerdon thee ;
But if thou dally once again , thou diest .
Enough of this , Boy .
2 Pyr .
Why then lament therefore : damn 'd be thy Guts un-
to King Pluto 's Hell , and Princely Erebus ; for Sparrows
must have Food .
'Pray , sweet Captain , let one of them do a little
of a Lady .
O ! he will make thee eternally enamour 'd of
him , there : Do , Sirrah , do ; 'twill allay your Fellow 's
Fury a little .
1 Pyr .
Master , mock on ; the Scorn thou givest me ,
Pray Jove some Lady may return on thee .
2 Pyr .
No, you shall see me do the Moor : Master ,
lend me your Scarf a little .
Here , 'tis at thy service , Boy .
2 Pyr .
You , Master Minos , heark hither a little .
How dost like him ?
art not rapt ?
art not
tickled now ?
dost not applaud , Rascal ?
dost not
applaud ?
Yes : What will you ask for 'em a Week , Cap -
tain ?
No, you mangonizing Slave , I will not part
from 'em ; you 'll sell 'em for Enghles , you : Let 's ha'
good Chear to morrow night at Supper , Stalker , and
then we 'll talk ; good Capon and Plover , do you hear ,
Sirrah ?
and do not bring your eating Player with you
there ; I cannot away with him : He will eat a Leg of
Mutton while I am in my Porridge , the lean Polupha -
gus , his Belly is like Barathrum , he looks like a Midwife
in Man 's Apparel , the Slave : Nor the villainous out-of -
tune Fidler ?nobarbus , bring not him .
What hast thou
there ?
six and thirty ?
ha ?
No, here 's all I have ( Captain ) some five and
twenty : Pray Sir , will you present , and accommodate
it unto the Gentleman ; for mine own part , I am a
meer Stranger to his Humour ; besides , I have some Bu-
siness invites me hence , with Master Asinius Lupus the
Well , go thy ways , pursue thy Projects , let me
alone with this Design ; my Poetaster shall make thee a
Play , and thou shalt be a Man of good Parts in it .
But
stay , let me see ; do not bring your ?sope , your Politi-
cian , unless you can ram up his Mouth with Cloves ; the
Slave smells ranker than some sixteen Dunghils , and is
seventeen times more rotten : Mary , you may bring
Frisker , my Zany : he 's a good skipping Swaggerer ; and
your fat Fool there , my Mango , bring him too ; but let
him not beg Rapiers nor Scarfs , in his over-familiar
playing Face , nor roar out his barren bold Jests with a
tormenting Laughter , between drunk and dry .
Do
you hear , Stiff-toe ?
Give him warning , admonition , to
forsake his sawcy glavering Grace , and his Goggle-eye ;
it does not become him , Sirrah ; tell him so .
I have
stood up and defended you , I , to Gent 'men , when you
have been said to prey upon Pu'nees , and honest Citi-
zens , for Socks or Buskins ; or when they ha' call 'd you
Usurers or Broakers , or said , you were able to help to a
piece of Flesh ?
I have sworn , I did not think so ;
nor that you were the common Retreats for Punks de-
cay 'd i' their Practice : I cannot believe it of you ?
Thank you , Captain : Jupiter and the rest of
the Gods confine your modern Delights , without dis -
Stay , thou shalt see the Moor e 're thou goest .
What 's he with the Half-arms there , that salutes us out
of his Cloke , like a Motion ?
ha ?
O , Sir , his Doublet 's a little decay 'd ; he is o -
therwise a very simple honest Fellow , Sir , one Deme -
trius , a Dresser of Plays about the Town here ; we have
hir 'd him to abuse Horace , and bring him in , in a Play ,
with all his Gallants ; as , Tibullus , Mec?nas ,
Cornelius
Gallus , and the rest .
And why so , Stinkard ?
O , it will get us a huge deal of Money ( Cap -
tain ) and we have need on't ; for this Winter has made
us all poorer than so many starv 'd Snakes : No body
comes at us , not a Gentleman , nor a ? ?
But you know nothing by him , do you , to make
a Play of ?
Faith , not much , Captain ; but our Author will
devise that that shall serve in some sort .
Why , my Parnassus , here , shall help him , if thou
Can thy Author do it impudently enough ?
O , I warrant you , Captain , and spitefully e-
nough too ; he has one of the most overflowing rank
Wits in Rome : He will slander any Man that breathes ,
if he disgust him .
I 'll know the poor , egregious , nitty Rascal ,
an' he have these commendable Qualities , I 'll che-
rish him , ( stay , here comes the Tartar ) I 'll make a Ga -
thering for him , I , a Purse , and put the poor Slave
in fresh Rags : Tell him so , to comfort him .
Well said ,
stalks as he acts .
2 Pyr .
Where art thou , Boy ?
Where is Calipolis ?
Fight Earthquakes in the Entrails of the Earth ,
And Eastern Whirlwinds in the Hellish Shades ;
Some foul Contagion of th ' infected Heavens
Blast all the Trees , and in their cursed tops
The dismal Night-raven and tragick Owl
Breed , and become Forerunners of my Fall .
Well , now fare thee well , my honest Peny-
Biter : Commend me to seven Shares and a half , and
remember to morrow ? ?
If you lack a Service ,
you shall play in my Name , Raskals ; but you shall
buy your own Cloth , and I 'll ha' two Shares for my
Let thy Author stay with me .
Yes , Sir .
' Twas well done , little Minos , thou didst stalk
well ; forgive me that I said thou stunk 'st , Minos :
'twas the favour of a Poet , I met sweating in the
Street , hangs yet in my Nostrils .
Who ?
Horace ?
I , he ; dost thou know him ?
O , he forsook me most barbarously , I protest .
Hang him , fusty Satyr , he smells all Goat ; he
carries a Ram under his Arm-holes , the Slave : I am
the worse when I see him .
Did not Minos impart ?
Yes , here are twenty Drachms he did convey .
Well said , keep 'em , we 'll share anon ; come ,
little Minos .
Faith , Captain , I 'll be bold to shew you a Mi-
striss of mine , a Jewellers Wife , a Gallant , as we go
There spoke my Genius .
Minos , some of thy
Eringoes , little Minos ; send .
Come hither , Parnassus ,
I must ha' thee familiar with my little Locust here ,
'tis a good Vermin , they say .
See heres Horace , and
old Trebatius , the great Lawyer , in this company ; let 's
avoid him now , he is too well seconded .
THere are to whom I seem excessive sower ;
And past a Satyrs Law , t 'extend my power :
Others , that think what ever I have writ
Wants pith , and matter to eternize it ;
And that they could , in one Days light , disclose
A thousand Verses , such as I compose .
What shall I do , Trebatius ?
And shall my Muse admit no more encrease ?
So I advise .
An ill Death let me die ,
If 'twere not best ; but sleep avoids mine Eye ,
And I use these , lest Nights should tedious seem .
Rather , contend to sleep , and live like them ,
That holding Golden sleep in special price ,
Rub 'd with sweet Oils , swim Silver Tyber thrice ,
And every Ev'en , with neat Wine steeped be .
Or , if such love of Writing ravish thee ,
Then dare to sing unconquer 'd C?sar 's deeds ;
Nor is't a Labour fit for every Pen ,
To paint the horrid Troops of armed Men ;
The Launces burst , in Gallia 's slaughtred Forces ;
Or wounded Parthians , tumbled from their Horses :
Great C?sar 's Wars cannot be fought with words .
Yet , what his Vertue in his Peace affords ,
His Fortitude , and Justice thou canst show ;
As wise Lucilius honour 'd Scipio .
Of that , my powers shall suffer no neglect ,
When such slight Labours may aspire respect :
But , if I watch not a most chosen time ,
The humble words of Flaccus cannot clime
Th' attentive Ear of C?sar ; nor must I
With less observance shun gross flattery :
For he , reposed safe in his own merit ,
Spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit .
But , how much better would such Accents sound
Than with a sad and serious Verse to wound
Pantolabus , railing in his sawcy Jests ?
Or Nomentanus spent in riotous Feasts ?
" In Satyrs , each Man ( though untoucht ) complains
" As he were hurt ; and hates such biting strains .
What shall I do ?
Milonius shakes his Heels
In ceasless dances , when his Brain once feels
The stirring fervour of the Wine ascend ;
And that his Eyes false numbers apprehend .
Castor his Horse ; Pollux loves handy Fights :
A thousand Heads , a thousand choise Delights .
My pleasure is in feet , my words to close ,
As , both our better , old Lucilius does :
He , as his trusty Friends , his Books did trust
With all his secrets ; nor , in things unjust ,
Or actions lawful , ran to other Men :
So that the old Man 's life , describ 'd was seen
As in a votive Table in his Lines ;
And to his steps my Genius inclines ;
Lucanian , or Apulian , I not whether ;
For the Venusian Colony plows either :
Sent thither , when the Sabines were forc 'd thence
( As old Fame sings ) to give the place defence
' Gainst such , as seeing it empty , might make rode
Upon the Empire ; or there fix abode :
Whether the Apulian borderer it were ,
Or the Lucanian violence they fear .
But this my stile no living Man shall touch ,
If first I be not forc 'd by base reproach ;
But , like a sheathed Sword , it shall defend
My innocent life ; for , why should I contend
To draw it out , when no malicious Thief
Robs my good name , the Treasure of my life ?
O Jupiter , let it with rust be eaten ,
Before it touch , or insolently threaten
The life of any with the least Disease ;
So much I love , and wooe a general Peace .
But , he that wrongs me , better I proclaim ,
He never had assai 'd to touch my fame .
For he shall weep , and walk with every Tongue
Throughout the City , infamously sung .
Servius , the Pr?tor , threats the Laws , and urn ,
If any at his Deeds repine or spurn ;
The Witch , Canidia , that Albutius got ,
Denounceth Witch-craft , where she loveth not ;
Thurius , the Judge , doth thunder worlds of ill ;
To such as strive with his judicial will ;
" All Men affright their foes in what they may ,
" Nature commands it , and Men must obey .
Observe with me ; " The Woolf his Tooth doth use ,
" The Bull his Horn .
And who doth this infuse ,
" But Nature ?
There 's luxurious Sc?va ; trust
His long-liv 'd Mother with him ; his so just
And scrupulous Right-hand no mischief will ;
No more , than with his Heel a Woolf will kill ,
Or Ox with Jaw : marry , let him alone
With temper 'd Poison to remove the croan .
But briefly , if to Age I destin 'd be ,
Or that quick Deaths black Wings inviron me ;
If rich , or poor ; at Rome ; or fate command
I shall be banish't to some other Land ;
What hew soever , my whole state shall bear ,
I will write Satyrs still , in spight of fear .
Horace , I fear , thou draw 'st no lasting Breath :
And that some great Man 's Friend will be thy Death .
What ?
when the Man that first did Satyrise ,
Durst pull the Skin over the Ears of Vice ,
And make , who stood in outward fashion clear ,
Give place , as foul within ; shall I forbear ?
Did L?lius , or the Man , so great with fame ,
That from sack't Carthage fetcht his worthy name ,
Storm , that Lucilius did Metellus pierce ?
Or bury Lupus quick , in famous Verse ?
Rulers , and Subjects , by whole Tribes he checkt ;
But Vertue , and her Friends did still protect :
And when from Sight , or from the Judgment-seat ,
The vertuous Scipio , and wise L?lius met ,
Unbrac't , with him in all light Sports , they shar 'd ;
Till , their most frugal Suppers were prepar 'd .
What e 're I am , though both for Wealth and Wit ,
Beneath Lucilius , I am pleas 'd to sit ;
Yet , Envy ( spight of her empoysoned Breast )
Shall say , I liv 'd in grace here , with the best ;
And seeking in weak trash to make her wound ,
Shall find me solid , and her Teeth unsound :
Less , learn 'd Trebatius censure disagree .
No, Horace , I of force must yield to thee ;
Only , take heed , as being advis 'd by me ,
Lest thou incur some danger : better pause ,
Than rue thy ignorance of the sacred Laws ;
I , with lewd Verses ; such as Libels be ,
And aim 'd at Persons of good Quality .
I reverence and adore that just Decree :
But if they shall be sharp , yet modest Rhimes
That spare Mens Persons , and but tax their Crimes ,
Such shall in open Court , find currant pass ;
Were C?sar Judge , and with the Makers grace .
Nay , I 'll add more ; if thou thy self being clear ,
Shalt tax in Person a Man , fit to bear
Shame , and reproach ; his Sute shall quickly be
Dissolv 'd in laughter , and thou thence sit free .
the Court , in sadness ?
Well enough ?
excellent well , sweet Mistris
Chloe , this strait-bodied City attire ( I can tell you ) will
stir a Courtiers Blood , more than the finest loose Sacks
the Ladies use to be put in ; and then you are as well
Jewel 'd as any of them ; your Ruff , and Linen about
you , is much more pure than theirs : And for your Beau -
ty , I can tell you , their 's many of them would defie the
Painter , if they could change with you .
Marry , the
worst is , you must look to be envied , and endure a few
Court-frumps for it .
O Jove , Madam , I shall buy them too cheap !
Give me my Muff , and my Dog there .
And will the
Ladies be any thing familiar with me , think you ?
O Juno! why , you shall see 'em flock about you
with their puff wings , and ask you , where you bought
your Lawn ?
and what you paid for it ?
who Starches
you ?
and entreat you to help 'em to some pure Lan-
dresses out of the City .
O Cupid ! give me my Fan , and my Mask too :
and will the Lords , and the Poets there , use one well
too , Lady ?
Doubt not of that ; you shall have kisses from
them , go pit-pat , pit-pat , pit-pat , upon your Lips , as
thick as Stones out of Slings , at the Assault of a City .
And then your Ears will be so furd with the breath of
their Complements , that you cannot catch cold of your
Head ( if you would ) in three Winters after .
Thank you , sweet Lady .
O Heaven ! And
how must one behave her self amongst 'em ?
you
know all .
Faith , impudently enough , Mistriss Chloe , and
well enough .
Carry not too much under-thought be-
twixt your self and them ; nor your City-mannerly
word ( forsooth , ) use it not too often in any case ; but
plain , I , Madam ; and , No Madam : Nor never say , your
Lordship , nor your Honour ; but , you , and you my
Lord , and my Lady : the other , they count too simple ,
and minsitive .
And though they desire to kiss Heaven
with their Titles , yet they will count them Fools that
give them too humbly .
O intolerable , Jupiter ! By my troth , Lady , I
would not for a World but you had lain in my House :
and i'faith you shall not pay a Farthing for your Board ,
nor your Chambers .
O , sweet Mistriss Chloe !
I'faith , you shall not Lady ; nay , good Lady , do
not offer it .
By your leave , bright
Stars , this Gentleman and I are come to man you
to Court : where your late kind entertainment is now
to be requited with a heavenly Banquet .
A heavenly Banquet , Gallus ?
No less , my dear , Cytheris .
That were not strange , Lady , if the Epithete
were only given for the company invited thither ; your
self , and this fair Gentlewoman .
Are we invited to Court , Sir ?
You are , Lady , by the great Princess , Julia :
who longs to greet you with any Favours , that may
worthily make you an often Courtier .
In sincerity , I thank her , Sir . You have a Coach ?
ha' you not ?
The Princess hath sent her own , Lady .
O Venus ! that 's well : I do long to ride in a
Coach most vehemently .
But , sweet Gallus , pray you , resolve me , why
you give that heavenly Praise , to this earthly Banquet ?
Because ( Cytheris ) it must be celebrated
by the heavenly Powers : All the Gods , and Goddesses
will be there ; to two of which you two must be ex -
A pretty Fiction in truth .
A fiction indeed , Chloe , and fit , for the fit of a
Why , Cytheris , may not Poets ( from whose
divine Spirits , all the Honours of the Gods have been
deduc't ) intreat so much Honour of the Gods , to have
their divine Presence at a Poetical Banquet ?
Suppose that no fiction : yet , where are your
Habilities to make us two Goddesses , at your Feast ?
Who knows not ( Cytheris ) that the sacred
Breath of a true Poet , can blow any vertuous Humani-
ty up to Deity ?
To tell you the femal truth ( which is the simple
truth ) Ladies ; and to shew that Poets ( in spight of
the World ) are able to Deifie themselves : At this Ban-
quet , to which you are invited , we intend to assume the
Figures of the Gods ; and to give our several Loves the
forms of Goddesses .
Ovid will be Jupiter ; the Princess
Julia , Juno ; Gallus here Apollo ; you Cytheris , Pallas ; I
will be Bacchus ; and my Love Plautia , Ceres : And to in-
stall you , and your Husband , fair Chloe , in Honours
equal with ours ; you shall be a Goddess , and your Hus -
band a God .
A God ?
O my God !
A God ; but a lame God , Lady : for he shall be
Vulcan , and you Venus .
And this will make our Banquet
no less than heavenly .
In sincerity , it will be sugred .
Good Jove , what
a pretty foolish thing it is to be a Poet ! But hark you ,
sweet Cytheris , could they not possibly leave out my
Husband ?
methinks a bodies Husband does not so well
at Court ; A bodies friend , or so ?
but Husband , 'tis
like your clog to your Marmaset , for all the World , and
the Heavens .
Tut , never fear , Chloe : your Husband will be left
without in the Lobby , or the great Chamber , when
you shall be put in , i' the Closet , by this Lord , and by
that Lady ,
Nay , then I am satisfied : he shall go .
HOrace ! Welcome .
Gentlemen , hear you the news ?
What news , my Quintus ?
Our melancholick Friend , Propertius ,
Hath clos 'd himself up in his Cynthia 's Tomb ;
And will by no intreaties be drawn thence .
Nay , good Master Crispinus , pray you , bring
neer the Gentleman .
Crispinus ?
Hide me , good Gallus : Tibullus , shel-
ter me .
Make your approach , sweet Captain .
What means this , Horace ?
I am surpriz 'd again , farewell .
Stay , Horace .
What , and be tir 'd on , by yond ' Vulture ?
No:
Ph?bus
defend me .
' Slight ! I hold my life ,
This same is he met him in Holy-street .
Troth , 'tis like enough .
This act of Propertius re -
lisheth very strange with me .
By
By thy leave , my neat scoundrel : what , is this
the mad Boy you talk't on ?
I , this is Master Albius , Captain .
Give me thy hand , Agamemnon ; we hear abroad
thou art the Hector of Citizens : what saist thou ?
are
we welcome to thee , noble Neoptolemus ?
Welcome , Captain , by Jove , and all the Gods
i'the Capitol ? ?
No more , we conceive thee .
Which of these is
thy Wedlock , Menelaus ?
thy Hellen ?
thy Lucrece ?
that
we may do her Honour ; mad Boy ?
She i' the little fine Dressing , Sir , is my Mistris .
For fault of a better , Sir .
A better , prophane Rascal ?
I cry the mercy
( my good scroil ) was't thou ?
No harm , Captain .
She is a Venus , a Vesta , a Melpomene : Come hi-
ther Penelope ; what 's thy name , Iris ?
My name is Chloe , Sir ; I am a Gentlewoman .
Thou art in merit to be an Empress ( Chloe ) for
an Eye and a Lip ; thou hast an Emperors Nose : kiss
me again : 'tis a vertuous Punk ; so .
Before Jove , the
Gods were a sort of Goslings , when they suffered so
sweet a Breath to perfume the Bed of a Stinkard : thou
hadst ill fortune , Thisbe ; the Fates were infatuate ; they
were , Punk ; they were .
That 's sure , Sir : let me crave your name , I
pray you , Sir .
I am known by the name of Captain Tucca ,
Punk ; the noble Roman , Punk : a Gentleman , and a
Commander , Punk .
In good time : a Gentleman , and a Commander ?
that 's as good as a Poet , methinks .
A pretty Instrument ! It 's my Cousin Cytheris
Viol , this : is't not ?
Nay , play Cousin , it wants but such a Voyce
and Hand , to grace it , as yours is .
Alas , Cousin , you are merrily inspir 'd .
'Pray you play , if you love me .
Yes , Cousin : you know , I do not hate you .
A most subtil Wench ! How she hath baited him
with a Viol yonder , for a Song !
Cousin , 'pray you call Mistris Chloe ; she shall
hear an Essay of my Poetry .
I 'll call her .
Come hither , Cockatrice : here 's
one , will set thee up , my sweet Punk ; set thee up .
Are you a Puet , so soon , Sir ?
Wife : mum .
S O N G.
LOve is blind , and a wanton ;
In the whole World , there is scant
One such another :
No, not his Mother .
He hath pluckt her Doves and Sparrows ,
To Feather his sharp Arrows ,
And alone prevaileth ,
Whilst sick Venus waileth .
But if Cypris once recover
The wag ; it shall behove her
To look better to him :
Or she will undo him .
O , most odoriferous Musick !
A , ha ! Stinkard .
Another Orpheus , you Slave ,
another Orpheus ! an Arion , riding on the Back of a
Dolphin , Rascal !
Have you a Copy of this Ditty , Sir ?
Master Albius has .
I , but in truth , they are my Wives Verses ; I
must not shew 'em .
Shew 'em , Bankrupt , shew 'em ; they have Salt
in 'em , and will brook the Air , Stinkard .
How ?
to his bright Mistris , Canidia ?
I , Sir , that 's but a borrowed name ; as Ovid 's Co-
rinna , or Propertius his Cynthia , or your Nemesis , or Delia ,
It 's the name of Horace his Witch , as I remember .
Why ?
the Ditt 'is all borrowed ; 'tis Horace 's :
hang him Plagiary .
How ?
he borrow of Horace ?
he shall pawn
himself to ten Brokers , first .
Do you hear , Poetasters ?
I know you to be Men of Worship ?
He shall write
with Horace , for a Talent : and let Mec?nas ,
and his
whole Colledge of Criticks take his part ; thou shalt
do 't , young Ph?bus :
thou shalt , Phaeton , thou shalt .
Alas , Sir , Horace ! he is a meer Spunge ; nothing
but Humours and Observation ; he goes up and down
sucking from every Society , and when he comes home
squeezes himself dry again .
I know him , I.
Thou saist true , my poor poetical Fury , he will
pen all he knows .
A sharp Thorny-tooth 'd Satyrical
Rascal , fly him ; he carries Hey in his Horn : he will
sooner lose his best Friend , than his least Jest .
What
he once drops upon Paper , against a Man , lives eternal-
ly to upbraid him in the Mouth of every Slave , Tankard -
bearer , or Water-man ; not a Bawd , or a Boy that
comes from the Bake-house , but shall point at him : 'tis
all Dog , and Scorpion ; he carries Poyson in his Teeth ,
and a Sting in his Tail .
Fough , Body of Jove ! I 'll
have the Slave whipt one of these days for his Sa -
tyrs and his Humours , by one casheer 'd Clark or ano -
We 'll under-take him , Captain .
I , and tickle him i'faith , for his arrogancy and
his impudence , in commending his own things ; and
for his translating .
I can trace him i'faith .
O , he is
the most open fellow living ; I had as lieve as a new
Sute I were at it .
Say no more then , but do it ; 'tis the only way
to get thee a new Suite ; sting him , my little Neufts ;
I 'll give you instructions : I 'll be your intelligencer ,
we 'll all joyn , and hang upon him like so many Horse -
leaches , the Players and all .
We shall sup together ,
soon ; and then we 'll conspire i'faith .
O , that Horace had staied still here .
So , would not I : for both these would have
turn 'd Pythagoreans then .
What , mute ?
I , as Fishes i' faith : come , Ladies , shall we go ?
We wait you , Sir . But Mistris Chloe asks , if you
have not a God to spare for this Gentleman .
Who , Captain Tucca ?
I ; he .
Yes , if we can invite him along , he shall be Mars .
Has Mars any thing to do with Venus ?
O , most of all , Lady .
Nay , then I pray ' let him be invited : and what
shall Crispinus be ?
Mercury ?
Mistris Chloe .
Mercury ?
that 's a Poet , is't ?
No, Lady ; but somewhat inclining that way :
he is a Herald at Arms .
A Herald at Arms ?
good : and Mercury ?
pretty :
he has to do with Venus too ?
A little with her Face , Lady ; or so .
' Tis very well ; pray ' let 's go , I long to be at it .
Gentlemen , shall we pray your companies along ?
You shall not only pray , but prevail , Lady ,
Come , sweet Captain .
Yes , I follow : but thou must not talk of this
now , my little Bankrupt .
Captain , look here : mum .
I 'll go write , Sir .
Do , do , stay : there 's a Drachm to purchase
Ginger-bread for thy Muse .
the door Lictor .
You are a Player , you say .
I , an't please your Worship .
Good : and how are you able to give this In-
telligence ?
Marry , Sir , they directed a Letter to me , and
my fellow-sharers .
Speak lower , you are not now i' your Theatre ,
Stager : my Sword , Knave .
They directed a Letter to
you , and your fellow-sharers : forward .
Yes , Sir ; to hire some of our properties ; as a
Scepter , and Crown , for Jove ; and a Caduceus for Mer-
cury : and a Petasus ? ?
Caduceus ?
and Petasus ?
Let me see your Letter .
This is a Conjuration ; a Conspiracy , this .
Quickly , on
with my Buskins : I 'll act a Trag?die ,
i' faith .
Will no-
thing but our Gods serve these Poets to prophane ?
Player , I thank thee .
The Emperour shall
take knowledge of thy good service .
Who 's there now ?
Look , Knave .
A Crown and a Scepter ?
this is good
Rebellion , now !
' Tis your 'pothecary , Sir , Master Minos .
What tell 'st thou me of 'pothecaries , Knave ?
Tell him ; I have Affairs of State in Hand ; I can talk
to no 'pothecaries , now .
Heart of me ! Stay the 'pothe-
cary there .
You shall see , I have fish't out a cunning piece of Plot
now : They have had some intelligence , that their pro-
ject is discover 'd , and now have they dealt with my
'pothecary , to Poyson me ; 'tis so ; knowing that I
meant to take Physick to day : As sure as Death , 'tis
Jupiter , I thank thee , that thou hast yet made
me so much of a Politician .
You are welcome , Sir ;
take the Potion from him there ; I have an Antidote more
than you wote off , Sir ; throw it on the Ground there :
Now fetch in the Dog ; and yet we cannot tarry
to try Experiments now : Arrest him , you shall go with
me , Sir ; I 'll tickle you , 'pothecary ; I 'll give you a Gli-
ster , i'faith .
Have I the Letter ?
I , 'tis here .
Come ,
your Fasces , Lictors : The half Pikes and the Halberds ,
take them down from the Lares , there .
Player , assist
Whither now , Asinius Lupus , with this Armory ?
I cannot talk now ; I charge you , assist me :
Treason , Treason .
How ?
Treason ?
I : if you love the Emperour , and the State ,
follow me .
GOds and Goddesses , take your several Seats , Now ,
Mercury , move your Caduceus , and in Jupiter 's name
command silence .
In the name of Jupiter , silence .
The Crier of the Court hath too clarified a
Peace , Momus .
Oh , he is the God of reprehension ; let him
' Tis his Office .
Mercury , go forward , and pro-
claim after Ph?bus ,
our high Pleasure , to all the Deities
that shall partake this high Banquet .
Yes , Sir .
The great , &c .
Of his , &c .
Willing , &c .
The great God , Jupiter ,
Of his licentious goodness ,
Willing to make this Feast , no Fast
From any , &c .
Nor to , &c .
To be , &c .
He gives , &c .
To speak , &c .
And to , &c .
And there , &c .
Shall need , &c .
Than any , &c .
Nor any , &c .
Shall need , &c .

But , since , &c .
In these , &c .
It shall , &c .
to break , &c .
To change ,&c .
As the , &c .
And the , &c .
And Jupiter , &c .
From any manner of pleasure ;
Nor to bind any God or Goddess ,
To be any thing the more God or God -
dess , for their names :
He gives them all free Licence ,
To speak no wiser than Persons of baser
Titles ;
And to be nothing better , than common
Men , or Women .
And therefore no God
Shall need to keep himself more strictly
to his Goddess ,
Than any Man do 's to his Wife .
Nor any Goddess
Shall need to keep her self more strictly
to her God ,
Than any Woman do 's to her Husband .
But , since it is no part of Wisdom ,
In these days , to come into Bonds ;
It shall be lawful for every Lover ,
To break loving Oaths ,
To change their Lovers , and make Love
to others ,
As the heat of every ones Blood ,
And the spirit of our Nectar shall inspire .
And Jupiter , save Jupiter .
So : now we may play the Fools , by Autho-
To play the Fool by Authority , is Wisdom .
Away with your mattery sentences , Momus ;
they are too grave and wise for this meeting .
Mercury , give our Jester a Stool , let him sit by ;
and reach him of our Cates .
Do 'st hear , mad Jupiter ?
We 'll have it enacted ,
He that speaks the first wise word , shall be made
What sai 'st thou ?
Is't not a good mo-
tion ?
Deities , are you all agreed ?
Agreed , great Jupiter .
I have read in a Book , that to play the Fool
wisely , is high Wisdom .
How now , Vulcan ! will you be the first Wi-
zard ?
Take his Wife , Mars , and make him Cuckold
Come Cockatrice .
No, let me alone with him , Jupiter : I 'll make
you take heed , Sir , while you live again ; if there be
twelve in a company , that you be not the wisest
of 'em .
No more ; I will not indeed , Wife , hereafter ;
I 'll be here : mum .
Fill us a Bowl of Nectar , Ganymede : we will
drink to our Daughter Venus .
Look to your Wife Vulcan : Jupiter begins to
court her .
Nay , let Mars look to it : Vulcan must do as
Venus do 's bear .
Sirrah , Boy : Catamite .
Look , you play Gany-
mede well now , you Slave .
Do not spill your Nectar ;
Carry your Cup even : so .
You should have rub 'd your
Face with Whites of Eggs , you Rascal ; till your Brows
had shone like our sooty Brothers here , as sleek as a
Horn-Book : or ha' steept your Lips in Wine , till you
made 'em so plump , that Juno might have been jealous
of 'em .
Punck , kiss me Punck .
Here , Daughter Venus , I drink to thee .
' Thank you , good Father Jupiter .
Why , Mother Juno! Gods and Fiends ! what ,
wilt thou suffer this ocular temptation ?
Mars is inrag 'd , he looks big , and begins to
stut for anger .
Well plaid , Captain Mars .
Well
Well said , Minstrel Momus : I must put you in ?
must I ?
When will you be in good fooling of your self ,
Fiddler ?
never ?
O , 'tis our fashion to be silent when there is a
better Fool in place ever .
Thank you , Rascal .
Fill to our Daughter Venus , Ganymede , who fills
her Father with affection .
Wilt thou be ranging Jupiter before my Face ?
Why not , Juno ?
why should Jupiter stand in
awe of thy Face , Juno ?
Because it is thy Wives Face , Jupiter .
What , shall a Husband be afraid of his Wives
Face ?
will she paint it so horribly ?
We are a King ,
Cot-quean ; and we will reign in our Pleasures ; and
we will cudgel thee to death , if thou find fault with us .
I will find fault with thee , King Cuckold-maker :
what , shall the King of Gods turn the King of Good
Fellows , and have no fellow in Wickedness ?
This
makes our Poets , that know our Prophaneness , live as
prophane as we : By my God-head , Jupiter ; I will
joyn with all the other Gods here , bind thee hand and
foot , throw thee down into the Earth , and make a poor
Poet of thee , if thou abuse me thus .
A good Smart tongu 'd Goddess ; a right Juno .
Juno , we will cudgel thee , Juno : we told thee
so yesterday , when thou wert jealous of us for Thetis .
Nay , to day she had me in inquisition too .
Well said my fine Phrigian fry , inform , inform .
Give me some Wine ( King of Heralds ) I may drink to
my Cockatrice .
No more , Ganymede , we will Cudgel thee ,
Juno : by Styx we will .
I , 'tis well , Gods may grow impudent in Iniqui-
ty , and they must not be told of it ? ?
Yea , we will knock our Chin against our
Breast , and shake thee out of Olympus into an Oyster-
boat , for thy scolding .
Your Nose is not long enough to do it , Jupiter ,
if all thy Stumpets , thou hast among the Stars , took
thy part .
And there is never a Star in my Fore-head ,
but shall be a Horn , if thou persist to abuse me .
A good Jest i' faith .
We tell thee , thou anger 'st us , Cot-quean ; and
we will thunder thee in pieces for thy Cot-queanity .
Another good Jest .
O , my Hammers and my Cyclops ! this Boy fills
not Wine enough , to make us kind enough to one another .
Nor thou hast not collied thy Face enough ,
I 'll ply the Table with Nectar , and make them
Heaven is like to have but a lame Stinker , then .
" Wine , and good Livers make true Lovers : I 'll
sentence them together .
Here Father , here Mother ,
for shame , drink your selves drunk , and forget this dis -
sention : you two should cling together before our Fa -
ces , and give us example of Unity .
O , excellently spoken , Vulcan , on the sudden !
Jupiter , may do well to prefer his Tongue to some
Office for his Eloquence .
His Tongue shall be Gentleman-usher to his Wit ,
and still go before it .
An excellent fit Office !
I , and an excellent good Jest besides
What , have you hired Mercury to cry your Jests
you make ?
Momus you are envious .
Why , you Whorson Block-head , 'tis your only
block of Wit in fashion ( now a days ) to applaud other
Folks Jests .
True : with those that are not Artificers themselves .
Vulcan , you nod ; and the mirth of the Jest droops .
He has fill 'd Nectar so long till his Brain swims in it .
What , do we nod , Fellow Gods ?
sound Mu-
sick , and let us startle our Spirits with a Song .
Do , Apollo ; thou art a good Musician .
What says Jupiter ?
Ha ?
ha ?
A Song .
Why , do , do , sing .
Bacchus , what say you ?
Ceres ?
But , to this Song ?
Sing for my part .
Your Belly weighs down your Head , Bacchus :
here 's a Song toward .
Begin , Vulcan ? ?
What else ?
what else ?
Say , Jupiter ? ?
Mercury ? ?
I say , say ? ?
S O N G.
WAke , our mirth begins to dye :
Quicken it with Tunes and Wine :
Raise your Notes , your out : fie , fie ,
This drowziness is an ill sign .
We banish him the Quire of Gods ,
that droops agen :
Then all are Men ,
For here 's not one , but nods .
I like not this sudden and general heaviness a -
mongst our God-heads : 'tis somewhat ominous .
Apollo ,
command us lowder Musick , and let Mercury and Momus
contend to please , and revive our Sences .
S O N G.
THen , in a free and lofty strain ,
Our broken Tunes we thus repair ;
And we answer them again ,
Running division on the panting Air :
To celebrate this feast of sence ,
As free from scandal as offence .
Here is Beauty for the Eye ;
For the Ear sweet Melody ;
Ambrosiack odours , for the smell ;
Delicious Nectar , for the taste ;
For the touch , a Ladies waste ;
Which doth all the rest excel !
I : This hath wak't us .
Mercury , our Herald ;
go from our self , the great God Jupiter , to the great
Emperor , Augustus C?sar : And command him from
us ( of whose Bounty he hath received his Sir-name ,
Augustus ) that for a Thank-offering to our Beneficense ,
he presently Sacrifice , as a Dish to this Banquet , his
beautiful and wanton Daughter Julia .
She 's a curst
Quean tell him ; and plays the scold behind his Back :
Therefore let her be Sacrific 'd .
Command him this ,
Mercury , in our high name of Jupiter Altitonans .
Stay , Feather-footed Mercury , and tell Augustus ,
from us the great Juno Saturnia ; if he think it hard to do ,
as Jupiter hath commanded him , and Sacrifice his Daugh -
ter , that he had better to do so ten times , than suffer her to
love the well-nos 'd Poet , Ovid ; whom he shall do well
to whip , or cause to be whipt about the Capitol , for
soothing her in her Follies .
mogenes , Pyrgus , Julia , Cytheris , Plautia , Chloe .
WHat sight is this ?
Mec?nas !
Horace ! say !
Have we our Senses ?
Do we hear and see ?
Or are these but imaginary Objects
Drawn by our Phantasie ?
Why speak you not ?
Let us do Sacrifice ?
Are they the Gods ?
Reverence , Amaze , and Fury fight in me .
What , do they kneel ?
Nay , then I see 'tis true
I thought impossible : O , impious sight !
Let me divert mine Eyes ; the very thought
Everts my Soul with Passion : look not , Man
There is a Panther , whose unnatural Eyes
Will strike thee dead : turn then and dye on her
With her own Death .
What means Imperial C?sar ?
What ?
would you have me let the Stumpet live ,
That , for this Pageant , earn so many deaths ?
Boy , slink Boy .
'Pray Jupiter we be not follow 'd by the scent , Master .
Say , Sir , what are you ?
I play Vulcan , Sir .
But what are you , Sir ?
Your Citizen and Jeweller , Sir .
And what are you Dame?
I play Venus , Forsooth ,
I ask not what you play , but what you are .
Your Citizen and Jewellers Wife , Sir .
And you , good Sir ?
Your Gentleman Parcel-Poet , Sir .
O , that prophaned Name !
And are these seemly Company for thee ,
Degenerate Monster ?
all the rest I know ,
And hate all knowledge for their hateful sakes .
Are you that first the Deities inspir 'd
With skill of their high Natures and their Powers ,
The first abusers of their useful Light ;
Prophaning thus their Dignities in their forms ;
And making them like you , but Counterfeits ?
O , who shall follow Vertue and embrace her ,
When her false Bosom is found nought but Air ?
And yet of those embraces Centaurs spring ,
That War with human Peace , and poyson Men .
Who shall , with greater Comforts , comprehend
Her unseen Being and her Excellence ;
When you that teach , and should eternize her ,
Live as she were no Law unto your Lives :
Nor liv 'd her self but with your idle Breaths ?
If you think Gods but fain 'd and Vertue painted ,
Know we sustain an actual Residence ;
And with the Title of an Emperor ,
Retain his Spirit and Imperial Power ;
By which ( in imposition too remiss ,
Licentious Naso , for thy violent wrong ,
In soothing the declin 'd Affections
Of our base Daughter ) we exile thy Feet
From all approach to our Imperial Court ,
On pain of death ; and thy mis-gotten Love
Commit to patronage of Iron Doors ;
Since her soft-hearted Sire cannot contain her .
O , good my Lord , forgive ; be like the Gods .
Let Royal bounty ( C?sar ) mediate .
There is no bounty to be shew 'd to such ,
As have no real goodness : Bounty is
But live in worship of that Idol , Vice ,
As if there were no vertue , but in shade
Of strong imagination , meerly enforc't ?
This shews their knowledge is meer Ignorance ;
Their farfetch Dignity of Soul , a Phansie ;
And all their square pretext of Gravity
A meer vain glory : hence , away with 'em .
I will prefer for knowledge , none , but such
As rule their Lives by it , and can becalm
All Sea of humour with the Marble Trident
Of their strong Spirits : Others fight below
With Gnats and Shadows , others nothing know .
WHat 's become of my little Punk , Venus , and the
Poult-foot Stinkard , her Husband ?
ha ?
O , they are rid home i' the Coach , as fast as the
Wheels can run .
God Jupiter is banisht , I hear : and his Cocka -
trice , Juno , lock't up .
' Heart , an' all the Poetry in Par-
nassus get me to be a Player again , I 'll sell 'em my share
for a Sesterce .
But this is humorous Horace , that Goat-
footed envious Slave ; he 's turn 'd faun now , an Infor-
mer , the Rogue : 'tis he has betraid us all .
Did you
not see him with the Emperor crouching ?
Well , follow me .
Thou shalt Libel and I 'll
Cudgel the Rascal .
Boy , provide me a Truncheon .
Revenge shall gratulate him , tam Marti , quam Mer-
I , but Master ; take heed how you give this out ;
Horace is a Man of the Sword .
' Tis true , in troth : they say , he 's Valiant .
Valiant ?
so is mine Arse ; Gods , and Fiends !
I 'll blow him into Air , when I meet him next : He dares
not fight with a Puck-fist .
Master , here he comes .
Horace
passes by .
Where ?
Jupiter same thee , my good
Poet ; my noble Prophet ; my little fat
I scorn to beat the Rogue i' the
Court ; and I saluted him , thus fair , because he
should suspect nothing , the Rascal : Come , we 'll go see
how forward our Journey-man is toward the untrussing
of him .
Do you hear , Captain ?
I 'll write nothing in it
but innocence : because I may swear I am innocent .
Nay , why pursue you not the Emperor for your
Reward now , Lupus ?
Stay , Asinius ;
You and your Stager , and your Band of Lictors :
I hope your Service merits more respect ,
Than thus , without a thanks to be sent hence !
Well , well , jest on , jest on .
Thou base unworthy Groom .
I , I , 'tis good .
Was this the Treason ?
this the dangerous Plot ,
Thy clamorous Tongue so bellowed through the Court ?
Hadst thou no other Project to encrease
Thy grace with C?sar , but this wolvish Train ,
To prey upon the Life of innocent Mirth
And harmless Pleasures , bred of noble Wit ?
Away , I lothe thy Presence ; such as thou ,
They are the Moths and Scarabes of a State ;
The bane of Empires , and the Dregs of Courts ;
Who ( to endear themselves to any Employment )
Care not whose fame they blast , whose life they endanger :
And under a disguis 'd and Cobweb mask
Of love , unto their Soveraign , vomit forth
Their own prodigious Malice ; and pretending
To be the Props and Columns of his safety ,
The Guards unto his Person , and his Peace ,
Disturb
Disturb it most , with their false Lapwing-cries .
C?sar shall know of this ; believe it .
C?sar doth know it ( Wolf ) and to his knowledge ,
He will ( I hope ) reward your base endeavours .
" Princes that will but hear , or give access
" To such officious Spies , can ne 're be safe :
" They take in Poyson with an open Ear ,
" And , free from danger , become Slaves to fear .
Let me be banisht Life ;
Since the chief end of Life is there concluded :
Within the Court is all the Kingdom bounded ,
And as her sacred Sphear doth comprehend
Ten thousand times so much , as so much Place
In any part of all the Empire else ;
So every Body , moving in her Sphear ,
Contains Ten thousand times as much in him ,
As any other , her choice Orb excludes .
As in a Circle , a Magician , then
Is safe against the Spirit he excites ;
But out of it is subject to his rage ,
And loseth all the Vertue of his Art :
So I , exil 'd the Circle of the Court ,
Lose all the good Gifts , that in it I 'joy 'd .
" No Vertue currant is , but with her Stamp :
" And no Vice vicious blauncht with her white Hand .
The Court 's the abstract of all Rome 's desert ;
And my dear Julia , th ' abstract of the Court .
Methinks , now I come neer her , I respire
Some Air of that late comfort , I receiv 'd :
And while the Evening , with her modest Vail ,
Gives leave to such poor Shaddows as my self ,
To steal abroad , I , like a heartless Ghost ,
Without the living Body of my Love ,
Will here walk , and attend her .
For I know
Not far from hence she is imprisoned ,
And hopes , of her strict Guardian , to bribe
So much admittance , as to speak to me ,
And chear my fainting Spirits with her Breath .
Julia , Ovid .
OVid ?
my Love ?
Here , heavenly Julia .
Here ?
and not here ?
O , how that word doth play
With both our Fortunes , differing , like our selves ,
Both one ; and yet divided , as oppos 'd ?
I high , thou low ?
O , this our plight of Place
Doubly presents the two lets of our love ,
Local and Ceremonial height , and lowness :
Both ways , I am too high , and thou too low .
Our Minds are even , yet : O , why should our Bodies ,
That are their Slaves , be so without their Rule ?
I 'll cast my self down to thee ; If I dye ,
I 'll ever live with thee : no height of Birth ,
Of Place , of Duty , or of cruel Power ,
Shall keep me from thee ; should my Father lock
This Body up within a Tomb of Brass ,
Yet I 'll be with thee .
If the forms , I hold
Now in my Soul , be made one substance with it ;
That Soul immortal ; and the same 'tis now ;
Death cannot raze th ' effects , she now retaineth :
And then , may she be any where she will .
The Souls of Parents rule not Childrens Souls ,
When Death sets both in their dissolv 'd Estates ;
Then is no Child nor Father : then Eternity
Frees all from any Temporal respect .
I come , my Ovid , take me in thine Arms :
And let me breath my Soul into thy Breast .
O , stay , my Love : the hopes thou dost conceive
Of thy quick Death , and of thy future Life ,
Are not authentical .
Thou choosest Death ,
So thou might 'st joy thy love in th ' other Life .
But know ( my Princely love ) when thou art dead ,
Thou only must survive in perfect Soul ;
And in the Soul are no Affections :
We powr out our Affections with our Blood ;
And with our Bloods affections fade our Loves .
" No Life hath Love in such sweet state as this ;
" No Essence is so dear to moody Sense ,
" As Flesh and Blood , whose quintessence is Sense .
" Beauty , compos 'd of Blood , and Flesh moves more ,
" And is more plausible to Blood and Flesh ,
" Than spiritual Beauty can be to the Spirit .
Such apprehension as we have in Dreams
( When sleep , the bond of Senses , locks them up )
Such shall we have when Death destroys them quite .
If love be then thy Object change not Life ;
Live high and happy still : I still below ,
Close with my Fortunes , in thy height shall joy .
Ay me , that Vertue , whose brave Eagles Wings
With every stroke blow Stars in burning Heaven ;
Should like a Swallow ( preying toward Storms )
Fly close to Earth : and with an eager Plume ,
Pursue those Objects which none else can see ,
But seem to all the World the empty Air .
Thus thou ( poor Ovid ) and all vertuous Men
Must prey like Swallows on invisible Food ;
Pursuing Flies , or nothing : and thus Love ,
And every Worldly Phansie , is transpos 'd
By worldly tyranny to what plight it list .
O , Father , since thou gav 'st me not my Mind ,
Strive not to rule it : Take , but what thou gav 'st
To thy disposure : Thy Affections
Rule not in me ; I must bear all my Griefs ;
Let me use all my Pleasures : vertuous Love
Was never scandal to a Goddess state .
But he 's inflexible ! and , my dear Love ,
Thy Life may chance be shortned by the length
Of my unwilling Speeches to depart .
Farewel sweet Life : though thou be yet exil 'd
Th' officious Court , enjoy me amply still :
My Soul , in this my Breath enters thine Ears ,
And on this turrets Floor will I lye dead ,
Till we may meet again .
In this proud height ,
I kneel beneath thee in my prostrate Love ,
And kiss the happy Sands that kiss thy Feet .
" Great Jove submits a Scepter , to a Cell ;
" And Lovers e 're they part will meet in Hell .
Ovid , Farewel all Company ; and if I could
All light with thee : Hells Shade should hide my Brows ,
Till thy dear Beauties Beams redeem 'd my Vows .
Ovid , my Love : alas , may we not stay
A little longer ( think 'st thou ) undiscer n 'd ?
For thine own good , fair Goddess , do not stay .
Who would ingage a Firmament of Fires ,
Shining in thee , for me , a falling Star ?
Be gone sweet Life-blood : if I should discern
Thy self but toucht , for my sake , I should dye .
I will be gone , then ; and not Heaven it self
Shall draw me back .
Yet Julia , if thou wilt ,
A little longer , stay .
I am content .
O , mighty Ovid ! what the sway of Heaven
Could not retire , my Breath hath turned back .
Who shall go first , my Love ?
my passionate Eyes
Will not endure to see thee turn from me .
If thou go first , my Soul will follow thee .
Then we must stay .
Ay me , there is no stay
In amorous Pleasures : if both stay , both dye .
I hear thy Father ; hence my Deity .
Fear forgeth sounds in my deluded Ears ;
I did not hear him : I am mad with love .
Q 2 There
There is no Spirit , under Heaven , that works
With such illusion : yet such Whitchcraft kill me ,
Ere a sound Mind , without it , save my Life .
Here , on my Knees , I worship the blest Place
That held my Goddess ; and the loving Air ,
That clos 'd her Body in his Silken Arms :
Vain Ovid ! kneel not to the Place , nor Air ;
She 's in thy Heart : rise then , and worship there .
" The truest Wisdom silly Men can have ,
" Is dotage , on the Follies of their Flesh .
And lov 'd to make inflictions fear 'd , not felt ;
Griev 'd to reprove , and joyful to reward ,
More proud of Reconcilement than Revenge ,
Resume into the late state of our love ,
Worthy Cornelius Callus , and Tibullus :
You both are Gentlemen ; you , Cornelius ,
A Soldier of Renown , and the first Provost
That ever let our Roman Eagles fly
On swarthy ?gypt , quarried with her Spoils .
Yet ( not to bear cold Forms , nor Mens Out-terms ,
Without the inward Fires , and Lives of Men )
You both have Vertues , shining through your shapes ;
To shew , your Titles are not writ on Posts ,
Or hollow Statues , which the best Men are ,
Without Promethean stuffings reach't from Heaven !
Sweet Poesies sacred Garlands crown your Gentry :
Which is , of all the Faculties on Earth ,
The most abstract , and perfect ; if she be
True born , and nurst with all the Sciences .
She can so mould Rome , and her Monuments ,
Within the liquid Marble of her Lines ,
That they shall stand fresh and miraculous ,
Even , when they mix with innovating Dust ;
In her sweet Streams shall our brave Roman Spirits
Chase , and swim after Death , with their choise Deeds
Shining on their white Shoulders ; and therein
Shall Tyber , and our famous Rivers fall
With such attraction , that th ' ambitious Line
Of the round World shall to her center shrink ,
To hear their Musick : And , for these high Parts ,
C?sar shall reverence the Pierian Arts .
Your Majesties high Grace to Poesie ,
Shall stand 'gainst all the dull Detractions
Of leaden Souls ; who ( for the vain assumings
Of some , quite worthless of her Soveraign wreaths )
Contain her worthiest Prophets in contempt .
Happy is Rome of all Earths other States ,
To have so true , and great a President ,
For her inferiour Spirits to imitate ,
As C?sar is ; who addeth to the Sun ,
Influence and lustre : in increasing thus
His Inspirations , kindling Fire in us .
Ph?bus
himself shall kneel at C?sar 's Shrine ,
And deck it with Bay-garlands dew 'd with Wine ,
To quit the Worship C?sar does to him :
Where other Princes , hoisted to their Thrones
By Fortunes possionate and disordered Power ,
Sit in their height , like Clouds before the Sun ,
Hindring his comforts ; and ( by their excess
Of cold in Vertue , and cross heat in Vice )
Thunder and Tempest on those Learned Heads ,
Whom C?sar with such honour doth advance .
All human Business Fortune doth command
Without all order ; and with her blind Hand ,
She , blind , bestows blind Gifts : that still have nurst ,
They see not who , nor how , but still , the worst .
C?sar , for his rule , and for so much stuff
As Fortune puts in his hand , shall dispose it
( As if his Hand had Eyes , and Soul , in it )
With worth and judgment .
" Hands , that part with Gifts ,
" Or will restrain their use , without desert ,
" Or with a misery , numm 'd to Vertues right ,
" Work , as they had no Soul to govern them ,
" And quite reject her : sev'ring their Estates
" From human order .
Whosoever can ,
" And will not cherish Vertue , is no Man .
Virgil is now at hand , Imperial C?sar .
Romes Honour is at hand then .
Fetch a Chair ,
And set it on our Right-hand ; where 'tis fit ,
Romes Honour and our own should ever sit .
Now he is come out of Campania ,
I doubt not , he hath finisht all his ?neids ,
Which , like another Soul , I long t ' enjoy .
Me-
c ?nas ,
Gallus ,
What think* you three , of Virgil , Gentlemen ,
( That are of his Profession , though rankt higher )
Or Horace , what saist thou , that art the poorest ,
And likeliest to envy , or to detract ?
C?sar speaks after common Men , in this ,
To make a difference of me , for my poorness :
As if the filth of Poverty sunk as deep
Into a knowing Spirit , as the bane
Of Riches doth into an ignorant Soul .
No, C?sar , they be pathless moorish Minds ,
That being once made rotten with the Dung
Of damned Riches , ever after sink
Beneath the steps of any Villany .
But knowledg is the Nectar , that keeps sweet
A perfect Soul , even in this Grave of Sin ;
And for my Soul , it is as free as C?sars :
For what I know is due I 'll give to all .
" He that detracts , or envies vertuous Merit ,
" Is still the covetous and the ignorant Spirit .
Thanks , Horace , for thy free and wholsom sharpness :
Which pleaseth C?sar more than servile fauns .
" A flatter 'd Prince soon turns the Prince of Fools .
And for thy sake , we 'll put no difference more
Between the great and good for being poor .
Say then , lov 'd Horace , thy true thought of Virgil .
I judge him of a rectified Spirit ,
By many Revolutions of discourse ,
( In his bright Reasons influence ) refin 'd
From all the tartarous Moods of common Men ;
Bearing the nature and similitude
Of a right heavenly Body ; most severe
In fashion and collection of himself :
And then as clear and confident as Jove .
And yet so chaste and tender is his Ear ,
In suffering any Syllable to pass ,
That he thinks may become the honour 'd name
Of Issue to his so examin 'd self ;
That all the lasting Fruits of his full Merit
In his own Poems , he doth still distaste :
As if his Minds Piece , which he strove to paint ,
Could not with Fleshly Pencils have her right .
But to approve his Works of soveraign worth ,
This Observation ( methinks ) more than serves ;
And is not vulgar .
That , which he hath writ ,
Is with such Judgment , labour 'd , and distill 'd
Through all the needful uses of our Lives ,
That could a Man remember but his Lines ,
He should not touch at any serious Point ,
But he might breath his Spirit out of him .
You mean , he might repeat part of his Works ,
As fit for any conference he can use ?
True , Royal C?sar .
Worthily observ 'd :
And a most worthy Vertue in his Works .
What thinks material Horace of his Learning ?
His Learning favours not the School-like gloss ,
That most consists in ecchoing Words and Terms ,
And soonest wins a Man an empty Name :
Nor
Nor any long , or far-fetch Circumstance ,
Wrapt in the curious Generalties of Arts :
But a direct and analytick Sum
Of all the worth and first effects of Arts .
And for his Poesie , 'tis so ramm 'd with Life ,
That it shall gather strength of Life , with being ,
And live hereafter more admir 'd than now .
This one consent , in all your Dooms of him ,
And mutual loves of all your several Merits ,
Argues a truth of merit in you all .
Welcom to C?sar , Virgil .
C?sar and Virgil
Shall differ but in sound ; to C?sar , Virgil
( Of his expressed greatness ) shall be made
A second Sir-name , and to Virgil , C?sar .
Where are thy famous ?neids ?
do us grace
to let us see , and surfeit on their sight .
Worthless they are of C?sars gracious Eyes ,
If they were perfect ; much more with their wants :
Which yet are more , than my time could supply .
And , could great C?sar 's expectation
Be satisfied with any other Service ,
I would not shew them .
Virgil is too modest ;
Or seeks , in vain , to make our longings more .
Shew them , sweet Virgil .
Then , in such due fear
As fits Presenters of great Works , to C?sar ,
I humbly shew them .
Let us now behold
A human Soul made visible in Life ;
And more refulgent in a sensless Paper ,
Than in the sensual Complement of Kings .
Read , read , thy self , dear Virgil ; let not me
Prophane one Accent with an untuned Tongue :
" Best matter , badly shown , shews worse , than bad .
See then this Chair , of purpose set for thee
To read thy Poem in ; refuse it not .
" Vertue , without Presumption , place may take
" Above best Kings , whom only she should make .
It will be thought a thing ridiculous
To present Eyes , and to all future times
A gross untruth ; that any Poet (void
Of Birth or Wealth , or temporal Dignity )
Should , with decorum , transcend C?sar 's Chair .
" Poor Vertue rais 'd , high Birth and Wealth set under ,
" Crosseth Heav'ns courses , and makes Worldings wonder .
The course of Heaven , and Fate it self in this
Will C?sar cross ; much more all worldly Custom .
" Custom , in course of Honour , ever Errs :
" And they are best , whom Fortune least prefers .
Horace hath ( but more strictly ) spoke our thoughts .
The vast rude swinge of general Confluence
Is , in particular ends , exempt from Sense :
And therefore reason ( which in right should be
The special Rector of all harmony )
Shall shew we are a Man , distinct by it ,
From those , whom Custom rapteth in her preass .
Ascend then , Virgil : and where first by chance
We here have turn 'd thy Book , do thou first read .
Great C?sar hath his will : I will ascend .
' Twere simple Injury to his free Hand ,
That sweeps the Cob-webs , from un-used Vertue ,
And makes her shine proportion 'd to her worth ,
To be more nice to entertain his Grace ;
Than he is choise , and liberal to afford it .
Gentlemen of our Chamber , guard the Doors ,
And let none enter ; peace .
Begin , good Virgil .
Mean while , the skies 'gan thunder , and in tail
Of that , fell powring Storms of Sleet and Hail :
The Tyrian Lords and Trojan Youth , each where
* Julius .
With Venus Dardane *Nephew , now , in fear
Seek out for several shelter through the Plain ;
Whilst Floods come rowling from the Hills amain .
* ?neas .
Dido a Cave , The Trojan *Prince the same
?
Lighted upon .
There , Earth and Heavens great ?Dame ,
That hath the charge of Marriage , first gave sign
Unto this Contract ; Fire and Air did shine ,
As guilty of the match ; and from the Hill
The Nymphs with shreekings do the Region fill .
Here first began their bane ; This day was ground
Of all their ills : For now , nor Rumours sound ,
Nor nice respect of State moves Dido ought ;
Her love no longer now by stealth is sought :
She calls this Wedlock , and with that fair Name
Covers her fault .
Forthwith the Brute and Fame ,
Through all the greatest Lybian Towns is gone ;
Fame , a fleet Evil , than which is swifter none :
That moving grows , and flying gathers strength ;
Little at first , and fearful ; but at length
She dares attempt the Skies , and stalking proud
With Feet on Ground , her Head doth pierce a Cloud !
This Child , our Parent Earth , stird up with spight
Of all the Gods , brought forth ; and , as some write ,
* C ?us
Enceli-
dus , &c .
She was last Sister of that Giant* Race ,
That thought to scale Jove 's Court ; right swift of pace ,
And swifter far of Wing : a Monster vast ,
And dreadful .
Look , how many Plumes are plac't
On her huge Corps , so many waking Eyes
Stick underneath : and ( which may stranger rise
In the report ) as many Tongues she bears ,
As many Mouths , as many listning Ears .
Nightly , in midst of all the Heaven she flies ,
And through the Earths dark shadow shreeking cries ;
Nor do her Eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep :
By day on tops of Houses she doth keep ,
Or on high Towers ; and doth thence affright
Cities and Towns of most conspicuous sight .
As covetous she is of Tales and Lyes ,
As prodigal of Truth : This Monster , &c .
Gallus , Tibullus , Horace , Equi-
tes Ro .
COme , follow me , assist me , second me : where 's
the Emperor ?
Eques 1 .
Sir , you must pardon us .
C?sar is private now ; you may not enter .
Not enter ?
Charge 'em , upon their Allegiance ,
Eques 1 .
We have a charge to the contrary , Sir .
I pronounce you all Traitors , horrible Traitors :
What ?
do you know my Affairs ?
I have matter of danger , and state to impart to C?sar .
What noise is there ?
who 's that names C?sar ?
A Friend to C?sar .
One that for C?sar 's good
would speak with C?sar .
Who is't ?
look , Cornelius .
Eques 1 .
Asinius Lupus .
O , bid the turbulent Informer hence ;
We have no vacant Ear , now , to receive
Th' unseason 'd Fruits of his officious Tongue .
You must avoid him there .
I conjure thee , as thou art C?sar , or respect 'st
thine own safety , or the safety of the State , C?sar :
Hear me , speak with me , C?sar ; 'tis no common Bu-
siness I come about ; but such as being neglected , may
concern the Life of C?sar .
The Life of C?sar ?
Let him enter .
Virgil
keep thy seat .
Bear back there : whither will you ?
keep
By
By thy leave good man Usher : mend thy Peruke ;
Lay hold on Horace there ; and on Mec?nas ,
Li-
Romans , offer no rescue , upon your allegiance :
Read , Royal C?sar .
I'le tickle you , Satyr .
He will , Humours , he will : He will squeeze you ,
Poet puckfist .
I'le lop you off , for an unprofitable branch , you
Satyrical Varlet .
I , and Epaminondas your Patron , here , with his
Flaggon Chain ; Come , resign : Though 'twere your
great Grand-fathers , the Law has made it mine now , Sir .
Look to him , my party-colour 'd Rascals ; look to
What is this , Asinius Lupus ?
I understand it
Not understand it ?
A Libel , C?sar : a dangerous ,
seditious Libel : a Libel in picture .
A Libel !
I , I found it in this Horace his Study , in Mec?nas
his house , here ; I challenge the Penalty of the Laws a -
gainst 'em .
I , and remember to beg their Land betimes ;
before some of these hungry Court-hounds scent it
Shew it to Horace : Ask him if he know it .
Know it ?
His hand is at it , C?sar .
Then 'tis no Libel .
It is the imperfect body of an Emblem , C?sar , I
began for Mec?nas
An Emblem ! right : That 's Greek for a Libel .
Do but mark , how confident he is .
A just man cannot fear , thou foolish Tribune ;
Not , though the malice of traducing tongues ,
The open vastness of a Tyrant 's Ear ,
The sensless rigour of the wrested Laws ,
Or the Red Eyes of strain 'd Authority
Should , in a point , meet all to take his Life .
His Innocency is armour 'gainst all these .
Innocence ! O Impudence ! Let me see , let me see .
Is not here an Eagle ! And is not that Eagle meant by
C?sar ?
ha ?
Do 's not C?sar give the Eagle ?
Answer me ;
what sayest thou ?
Hast thou any Evasion , Stinkard ?
Now he 's turn 'd dumb .
I'le tickle you , Satyr .
Pish : Ha , ha .
Dost thou pish me ?
Give me my long Sword .
With reverence to great C?sar , worthy Romans ,
Observe but this ridiculous Commenter :
The soul to my device , was in this Distick :
Thus , oft , the base and ravenous multitude
Survives , to share the Spoils of Fortitude .
Which is this body , I have figur 'd here ,
A Vulture ? ? ?
A Vulture ?
I , now , 'tis a Vulture .
O , abomina -
ble ! monstrous ! monstrous ! has not your Vulture a
Beak ?
has it not Legs , and Talons , and Wings , and Fea -
thers ?
Touch him , old Buskins .
And therefore must it be an Eagle ?
Respect him not , good Horace : Say your device .
A Vulture , and a Wolf ? ? ?
A Wolf ! good : That 's I ; I am the Wolf : My
Name 's Lupus ; I am meant by the Wolf .
On , on , a Vul-
ture and a Wolf ? ? ?
Preying upon the Carcass of an Ass ?
An Ass ! Good still : That 's I too ; I am the Ass .
You mean me by the Ass ?
'Pr'y thee , leave braying then .
If you will needs take it , I cannot with modesty
give it from you .
But , by that beast , the old Egyptians
Were wont to figure in their Hieroglyphicks ,
Patience , Frugality , and Fortitude ;
For none of which we can suspect you , Tribune .
Who was it , Lupus , that inform 'd you first ,
This should be meant by us ?
Or was't your Comment ?
No, C?sar : A Player gave me the first light of it
I , an honest Sycophant-like Slave , and a Politici-
an besides .
Where is that Player ?
He is without here .
Call him in .
Call in the Player there : Master ?sop , call
Player : where is the Player ?
Bear back : None
but the Player enter .
Yes , this Gentleman , and his Achates must .
'Pray you , Master Usher ; we 'll stand close ,
' Tis a Gentleman of Quality , this ; though he be
somewhat out of Clothes , I tell ye .
Come ?sop , hast
a Bay-leaf i' thy mouth ?
Well said , be not out , Stinkard .
Thou shalt have a Monopoly of playing confirm 'd to thee
and thy Convoy , under the Emperor 's Broad Seal , for
this Service .
Is this he ?
I , C?sar , this is he .
Let him be whipt .
Lictors , go take him hence .
And Lupus , for your fierce Credulity ,
One fit him with a pair of larger Ears :
' Tis C?sar 's Doom , and must not be revok't .
We hate to have our Court and Peace disturb 'd
With these Quotidian Clamours .
See it done .
Gag him , we may have his silence .
C?sar hath done like C?sar .
Fair and just
Is his award , against these brainless Creatures .
' Tis not the wholesome sharp Morality ,
Or modest anger of a Satyrick Spirit ,
That hurts or wounds the body of a State ;
But the sinister application
Of the malicious , ignorant , and base
Interpreter : who will distort , and strain
The general scope and purpose of an Author ,
To his particular and private Spleen .
We know it , our dear Virgil , and esteem it
A most dishonest practice in that man ,
Will seem too witty in anothers work .
What would Cornelius Gallus , and Tibullus ?
Nay , but as thou art a Man , dost hear ?
a Man
of Worship , and Honourable : Hold , here , take thy
Chain again .
Resume , mad Mec?nas .
What ! dost
thou think I meant t ' have kept it , bold boy ?
No: I
did it but to fright thee ; I , to try how thou would 'st take
What ! will I turn Shark upon my Friends , or my
Friends Friends ?
I scorn it with my three Souls .
Come ,
I love Bully Horace as well as thou dost , I : 'tis an honest
Give me thy wrist , Helicon .
Dost thou
think I'le second e 're a Rhinoceros of them all , against
thee ?
ha ?
or thy Noble Hippocrene , here ?
I'le turn Sta -
ger first , and be whipt too : dost thou see , Bully ?
You have your will of C?sar : use it Romans .
Virgil shall be your Pr?tor ; and our self
Will here sit by , Spectator of your sports ;
And think it no Impeach of Royalty .
Our Ear is now too much prophan 'd ( grave Maro )
With these distastes , to take thy sacred Lines :
Put up thy Book , till both the time and we
Be fitted with more hallowed circumstance
For the receiving so divine a work .
Proceed with your design .
Thanks to great C?sar .
Tibullus , draw you the Indictment then , whilst
Horace arrests them on the Statute of Calumny : Mec?nas ,
and
and I , will take our Places here .
Lictors , assist him .
I am the worst accuser under Heaven .
Tut , you must do 't : 'twill be noble mirth .
I take no knowledge that they do malign me .
I , but the world takes knowledge .
Would the world knew ,
How heartily I wish a fool should hate me .
Body of Jupiter ! What ! will they arraign my
brisk Poetaster , and his poor Journey-man , ha ?
Would
I were abroad skeldring for a Drachm , so I were out of
his Labyrinth again ; I do feel my self turn Stinkard al-
But I must set the best Face I have upon't now :
well said , my divine , deft Horace , bring the whorson de-
tracting Slaves to the Bar , do .
Make 'em hold up their
Spread Golls : I'le give in Evidence for thee , if thou wilt .
Take Courage , Crispinus ; would thy Man had a clean
VVhat must we do , Captain ?
Thou shalt see anon : Do not make division with
thy Legs so .
What 's he , Horace ?
I only know him for a motion , C?sar .
I am one of thy Commanders , C?sar ; a Man
Do you know him , Cornelius ?
He 's one that hath had the Mustring , or Convoy
of a Company , now and then : I never noted him by any
other Imployment .
We will observe him better .
Lictor , proclaim silence in the Court .
In the Name of C?sar , silence .
Let the Parties , the accuser and the accused , pre -
sent themselves .
The accuser , and the accused , present your selves
in Court .
Read the Indictment .
Rufus Laberius Crispinus , and Demetrius Fanni-
us , Hold up your hands , You are , before this time , joyntly
and severally Indicted , and here presently to be arraigned , up -
on the Statute of Calumny , or Lex Remmia ( the one by
the Name of Rufus Laberius Crispinus , alias Crispinas ,
Poetaster , and Plagiary ; the other by the Name of De-
metrius Fannius , Play-dresser , and Plagiary ) , That you ,
( not having the Fear of Ph?bus ,
or his Shafts , before your
Eyes ) , contrary to the Peace of our Liege Lord , Augustus
C?sar , his Crown and Dignity , and against the Form of a
Statute , in that case made and provided ; have most ignorant-
ly , foolishly , and ( more like you selves ) maliciously , gone a -
bout to deprave , and calumniate the Person and Writings of
Quintus Horacius Flaccus , here present , Poet , and Priest
to the Muses : and to that end have mutually conspir 'd and
plotted , at sundry times , as by several means , and in sun -
dry places , for the better accomplishing your base and envious
purpose ; taxing him , falsly , of Self-love , Arrogancy , Im -
pudence , Railing , filching by translation , &c .
Of all
which Calumnies , and every of them , in manner and form
aforesaid ; What answer you ?
Are you guilty , or not
guilty ?
Not guilty , say .
Not guilty .
How will you be tried ?
By the Roman Gods , and the Noblest Romans .
By the Roman Gods , and the Noblest Ro -
Here sits Mec?nas
and Cornelius Gallus .
Are you contented to be tried by these ?
I , so the noble Captain may be joyn 'd with them
in Commission , say .
I , so the noble Captain may be joyn 'd with
them in Commission .
What says the Plaintiff ?
I am content .
Captain , then take your place .
Alas , my worshipful Pr?tor ! 'tis more of thy
gent 'ness than of my deserving , I wusse .
But since it
hath pleas 'd the Court to make choice of my Wis-
dom and Gravity , come , my Calumnious Varlets :
Let 's hear you talk for your selves , now , an hour or
What can you say ?
Make a noise .
By thunder-darting Jove , the King of Gods ;
And by the Genius of Augustus C?sar ;
By your own white and uncorrupted Souls ;
And the deep reverence of our Roman Justice ;
To judge this Case , with truth and equity :
As bound , by your Religion , and your Laws .
Now read the Evidence : But first demand
Of either Prisoner , if that Writ be theirs .
Shew this unto Crispinus .
Is it yours ?
Say , I : what ! dost thou stand upon it , Pimp ?
Do not deny thine own Minerva , thy Pallas , the issue of
thy brain .
Yes , it is mine .
Shew that unto Demetrius .
Is it yours ?
It is .
There 's a Father , will not deny his own Bastard ,
now , I warrant thee .
Read them aloud .
Rampe up my genius ; be not retrograde :
But boldly nominate a Spade , a Spade .
What , shall thy lubrical and glibbery Muse
Live , as she were defunct , like Punk in Stews ?
Excellent ! )
Alas ! that were no modern consequence ,
To have Cothurnal Buskins frighted hence .
No, teach thy Incubus to Poetize ;
And throw abroad thy spurious snotteries ,
Upon that puft-up lump of barmy froth .
Ah , ha ! )
Or clumsie chil-blain 'd judgment : that with Oath ,
Magnificates his Merit ; and bespawls
The conscious time , with humerous fome and brawls ,
As if his Organons of Sense would crack
The sinews of my Patience .
Break his back ,
O Poets all , and some : For now we list
Of strenuous Vengeance to clutch the fist .
I marry , this was written like a Hercules in Poetry ,
Excellently well threatned !
And as strangely worded , C?sar .
We observe it .
The other , now .
This 's a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too :
this 'll do well .
Our Muse is in mind for th ' untrussing a Poet ;
I slip by his Name ; for most men do know it :
A Critick , that all the World bescumbers
With Satyrical humours , and Lyrical numbers :
Art thou there , boy ? )
And for the most part , himself doth advance
With much Self-love , and more Arrogance .
Good again . )
And ( but that I would not be thought a Prater )
I could tell you , he were a translater .
I know the Authors from whence he has stole ,
And could trace him too , but that I understand 'em
not full and whole .
That Line is broke loose from all his fellows :
Chain him up shorter , do . )
The best Note I can give you to know him by ,
Is , that he keeps Gallants company ;
Whom I could wish , in time should him fear ,
Lest after they buy Repentance too dear .
Well said .
This carries 'palm with it .
And why , thou motly Gull ?
why should they fear ?
When hast thou known us wrong , or tax a friend ?
I dare thy malice , to betray it .
Now thou curl 'st up , thou poor and nasty Snake ,
And shrink 'st thy poys 'nous head into thy bosom :
Out Viper , thou that eat 'st thy Parents , hence .
Rather , such speckled Creatures , as thy self ,
Should be eschew 'd , and shun 'd : such as will bite
And gnaw their absent friends , not cure their Fame ;
Catch at the loosest laughters , and affect
To be thought Jesters ; such as can devise
Things never seen , or heard , t 'impair mens Names ,
And gratifie their credulous adversaries ;
Will carry tales , do basest offices ,
Cherish divided fires , and still increase
New flames , out of old embers ; will reveal
Each secret that 's committed to their trust :
These be black Slaves : Romans , take heed of these .
Thou twang 'st right , little Horace ; they be indeed
A couple of chap-faln Curs .
Come , We of the Bench ,
Let 's rise to the Urn , and condemn 'em quickly .
Before you go together ( worthy Romans )
We are to tender our Opinion ;
And give you those Instructions , that may add
Unto your even Judgment in the Cause :
Which thus we do commence : First , you must know ,
That were there is a true and perfect merit ,
There can be no dejection ; and the scorn
Of humble baseness , oftentimes , so works
In a high Soul , upon the grosser Spirit ,
That to his bleared and offended Sense ,
There seems a hideous Fault blaz 'd in the Object ;
When only the Disease is in his Eyes .
Here-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax't
Of Impudence , Self-love , and Arrogance ,
By these who share no merit in themselves ;
And therefore , think his Portion is as small .
For they , from their own guilt , assure their Souls ,
If they should confidently praise their works ,
In them it would appear Inflation :
Which , in a full , and well digested Man ,
Cannot receive that foul abusive name ,
But the fair title of Erection .
And , for his true use of translating Men ,
It still hath been a work of as much palm ,
In clearest Judgments , as t ' invent , or make
His sharpness , that is most excusable ;
As being forc't out of a suffering Vertue ,
Oppressed with the licence of the time :
And howsoever Fools , or jerking Pendants ,
Players , or such like Buffoons , barking wits ,
May with their beggarly , and barren trash ,
Tickle base Vulgar Ears , in their despite ;
This ( like Jove 's thunder ) shall their pride controul ,
" The honest Satyr hath the happiest Soul .
Now , Romans , you have heard our thoughts ; Withdraw
when you please .
Remove the accused from the Bar .
Who holds the Urn to us ?
ha ?
Fear nothing :
I'le quit you , mine honest pitiful Stinkards ; I'le do 't .
Captain , you shall eternally girt me to you , as I
am generous .
Go to .
Tibullus , Let there be a Case of Vizards private -
ly provided : we have found a Subject to bestow them
It shall be done , C?sar .
Here be words , Horace , able to bastinado a Mans
Please it , great C?sar , I have Pills about me
( Mixt with the whitest kind of Ellebore )
Would give him a light Vomit ; that should purge
His Brain , and Stomach of those tumorous Heats :
Might I have leave to minister unto him .
O ! be his ?sculapius , gentle Horace ;
You shall have leave , and he shall be your Patient .
Virgil , use your authority , command him forth .
C?sar is careful of your health , Crispinus ;
And hath himself chose a Physician
To minister unto you : take his Pills .
They are somewhat bitter , Sir , but very wholsome ;
Take yet another ; so : Stand by , they 'll work anon .
Romans , return to your several seats : Lictors ,
bring forward the Urn ; and set the accused at the
Quickly , you whorson egregious Varlets ; Come
What ! shall we sit all day upon you ?
You
make no more haste , now , than a Beggar upon Pattins ;
or a Physician to a Patient that has no Money , you Pil-
Rufus Laberius Crispinus , and Demetrius Fanni-
us , hold up your Hands .
You have ( according to the
Roman Custom ) put your selves upon trial to the
Urn , for divers and sundry Calumnies , whereof ,
you have before this time been Indicted , and are now
presently Arraigned : Prepare your selves to hearken
to the Verdict of your Tryers .
Caius Cilnius Me-
c ?nas
pronounceth you , by this Hand-writing , Guil-
Cornelius Gallus , Guilty .
Pantilius Tucca ? ?
Parcel-guilty , I.
He means himself : for it was he indeed
Suborn 'd us to the Calumny .
I , you whorson Cantharides ! was't I ?
I appeal to your Conscience , Captain .
Then you confess it now .
I do , and crave the mercy of the Court .
What faith Crispinus ?
O , the Captain , the Captain ? ?
My Physick begins to work with my Patient ,
I see .
Captain , stand forth and answer .
Hold thy peace , Poet Pr?tor : I appeal from
thee to C?sar , I.
Do me right , Royal C?sar .
Marry , and I will , Sir . Lictors , gag him : do .
And put a Case of Vizards o 're his head ,
That he may look bi-fronted as he speaks .
Gods and Friends ! C?sar ! thou wilt not , C?sar ,
wilt thou ?
Away , you whorson Vultures ; away .
You
think I am a dead Corps now , because C?sar is dispos 'd
to jest with a Man of Mark , or so .
Hold your hook't
Talons out of my flesh , you inhumane Harpies .
Go
to , do 't .
What ! will the Royal Augustus cast away
a Gent 'man of Worship , a Captain and a Comman-
der , for a Couple of Condemn 'd Caitive Calumnious
Cargo 's ?
Dispatch , Lictors .
Forward , Tibullus .
Demand what cause they had to maligne Horace .
In troth , no great cause , not I ; I must confess :
but that he kept better Company ( for the most part )
than I : and that better Men lov 'd him than lov 'd
me : and that his Writings thriv 'd better than mine ,
and were better lik't , and grac't : nothing else .
Thus envious Souls repine at others good .
If this be all , faith , I forgive thee freely .
Envy me still , so long as Virgil loves me ,
Gallus , Tibullus , and the best-best C?sar ,
My dear Mec?nas :
while these , with many more
( Whose names I wisely slip ) shall think me worthy
Their honour 'd and ador 'd Society ,
And read and love , prove and applaud my Poems ;
I would not wish but such as you should spight them .
O ? ?
How now , Crispinus ?
O , I am sick ? ?
A Bason , a Bason , quickly ; our Physick works .
Faint not , Man .
O ?
retrograde ?
reciprocal ?
What 's that , Horace ?
Retrograde , and reciprocal Incubus are come up .
Thanks be to Jupiter .
O ?
glibbery ?
lubrical ?
defunct ?
O ?
Well said ; here 's some store .
What are they ?
Glibbery , lubrical , and defunct .
O , they came up easie .
O ?
O ?
What 's that ?
Nothing yet .
Magnificate ?
That came up somewhat hard .
What chear , Crispinus ?
O , I shall cast up my ?
spurious ?
snotteries ?
Chilblain 'd ?
O ?
O ?
clumsie ?
That clumsie stuck terribly .
What 's all that , Horace ?
Spurious , snotteries , chilblain 'd , clumsie .
O Jupiter .
Who would have thought there should ha' been
such a deal of Filth in a Poet ?
O ?
barmy froth ?
What 's that ?
?
Puffie ?
inflate ?
turgidous ?
Barmy froth , puffie , inflate , turgidous , and ventosi-
tous are come up .
O terrible windy words .
A sign of a windy Brain .
O ?
Oblatrant ?
furibund ?
fatuate ?
strenuous ?
Here 's a deal ; oblatrant , furibund , fatuate , strenuous .
Now all 's come up , I trow .
What a Tumult he
had in his Belly !
No, there 's the often conscious damp behind still .
O ?
conscious ?
It 's come up , thanks to Apollo and ?sculapius :
Yet there 's another ; you were best take a Pill more .
O , no ; O ?
O ?
O ?
O ?
Force your self then a little with your Finger .
O ?
O ?
Prorumped ?
What a noise it made ! as if his Spi-
rit would have prorumpt with it .
O ?
O ?
Help him ; it sticks strangely , what ever it is .
O ?
Now it 's come ; clutcht .
Clutcht ?
It 's well that 's come up ; it had but a
narrow Passage .
O ? ?
Again , hold him , hold his Head there .
Snarling Gusts ?
quaking Custard .
How now , Crispinus ?
O ?
Nay , that are all we , I assure you .
How do you feel your self ?
Pretty and well , I thank you .
These Pills can but restore him for a time ;
Not cure him quite of such a Malady ,
Caught by so many Surfeits , which have fill 'd
His Blood and Brain thus full of Crudities :
' Tis necessary therefore he observe
A strict and wholesom Diet .
Look you take
Each Morning of old Cato 's Principles
A good Draught next your Heart , and walk upon't ,
Till it be well digested : Then come home ,
And taste a piece of Terence , suck his Phrase
In stead of Liquorish ; and , at any hand ,
Shun Plautus , and old Ennius ; they are Meats
Too harsh for a weak Stomack .
Use to read
( But not without a Tutor ) the best Greeks ,
As Orpheus , Mus?us , Pindarus ,
Hesiod , Callimachus , and Theocrite ,
High Homer ; but beware of Lycophron ,
He is too dark and dangerous a Dish .
You must not hunt for wild outlandish Terms ,
To stuff out a peculiar Dialect ;
But let your Matter run before your Words .
And if at any time you chance to meet
Some Gallo-Belgick Phrase , you shall not straight
Rack your poor Verse to give it entertainment ,
But let it pass ; and do not think your self
Much damnified , if you do leave it out ,
When nor your Understanding , nor the Sense
Could well receive it .
This fair Abstinence ,
In time , will render you more sound and clear :
And this have I prescrib 'd to you , in place
Of a strict Sentence ; which till he perform ,
Attire him in that Robe .
And henceforth learn
To bear your self more humbly ; not to swell ,
Or breath your insolent and idle Spite
On him whose Laughter can your worst affright .
Take him away .
Jupiter guard C?sar .
And for a week or two see him lockt up
In some dark Place , remov 'd from Company ;
He will talk idly else after his Physick .
Now to you , Sir . Th' Extremity of Law
Awards you to be branded in the Front ,
For this your Calumny : But since it pleaseth
Horace ( the Party wrong 'd ) t ' intreat of C?sar
A Mitigation of that juster Doom ,
With C?sar 's Tongue thus we pronounce your Sentence .
Demetrius Fannius , thou shalt here put on
That Coat and Cap , and henceforth think thy self
No other than they make thee ; vow to wear them
In every fair and generous Assembly ,
Till the best sort of Minds shall take to knowledge
As well thy Satisfaction , as thy Wrongs .
Only ( grave Pr?tor ) here , in open Court ,
I crave , the Oath for good Behaviour
May be administred unto them both .
Horace , it shall : Tibullus , give it them .
Rufus Laberius Crispinus , and Demetrius Fan-
nius , lay your Hands on your Hearts .
You shall here so -
lemnly attest and swear , That never ( after this instant ) ei-
ther at Booksellers Stalls , in Taverns , Two-peny Rooms , Ty-
ring-houses , Noblemens Butteries , Puisne 's Chambers ( the best
and farthest Places where you are admitted to come ) you
shall once offer or dare ( thereby to endear your self the more
to any Player , Enghle , or guilty Gull in your Company ) to
malign , traduce , or detract the Person or Writings of Quin-
tus Horacius Flaccus or any other eminent Man , transcend -
ing you in merit , whom your Envy shall find cause to work
upon , either for that , or for keeping himself in better
Acquaintance , or enjoying better Friends ; or if ( transported
by any sudden and desperate Resolution ) you do , That then
you shall not under the Bastoun , or in the next Presence , be-
ing an honourable Assembly of his Favourers , be brought as
voluntary Gentlemen to undertake the forswearing of it .
Neither shall you at any time (ambitiously affecting the Title
of the Untrussers or Whippers of the Age ) suffer the Itch of
Writing to over-run your Performance in Libel , upon pain of
being taken up for Lepers in Wit , and ( losing both your
Time and your Papers ) be irrecoverably forfeited to the
Hospital of Fools .
So help you our Roman Gods , and the
Genius of Great C?sar .
So , now dissolve the Court .
And thanks to C?sar ,
That thus hath exercis 'd his Patience .
We have , indeed , you worthiest Friends of C?sar .
It is the Bane and Torment of our Ears ,
To hear the Discords of those jangling Rimers ,
That with their bad and scandalous Practices
Bring all true Arts and Learning in contempt .
But let not your high thoughts descend so low
