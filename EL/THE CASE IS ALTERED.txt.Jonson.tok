YOU woful wights , give ear a
while ,
And mark the tenor of my stile ,
Enter Onion in haste .
Which shall such trembling hearts unfold ,
As seldom hath to fore been told ,
Such chances are , and doleful news , ?? ?
Fellow Juniper ! peace a god 's
As may attempt your wits to muse .
Godso , hear , man ! a pox a god
on you .
And cause such trickling tears to
pass ,
Except your hearts be flint or brass : ?? ?
Juniper ! Juniper !
To hear the news which I shall tell ,
That in Custella once befel .
'Sblood , where didst thou learn to corrupt
a man in the midst of a verse , ha ?
Godslid , man , service is ready to
go up , man : you must slip on your coat ,
and come in ; we lack waiters pitifully .
A pitiful hearing ; for now must I
of a merry cobler become mourning crea -
Well , you 'll come .
Go to , a word to the wise ,
away , fly , vanish :
Lie there the weeds that I disdain to wear .
God save you , master Juniper .
What signior Antonio Balladino!
welcome sweet Ingle .
And how do you , sir ?
Faith you see , put to my shifts
here , as poor retainers be oft-times .
Sirrah ,
Antony , there 's one of my fellows mightily
enamoured of thee ; and I faith , you slave ,
now you 're come , I 'll bring you together :

you know him ?
No, not yet , I assure you .
O he is one as right of thy humour
as may be , a plain simple rascal , a true
dunce ; marry he hath been a notable
villain in his time : he is in love , sirrah , with
a wench , and I have preferred thee to him ;
thou shalt make him some pretty paradox ,
or some allegory .
How does my coat sit ?
well ?
I , very well .
Enter Onion .
Nay , godso , fellow Juniper , come
Art thou there , mad slave ?
Icome with a powder .
Sirrah , fellow Onion ,
I must have you peruse this gentleman well ,
and do him good offices of respect and
kindnesses , as instances shall be given .
Nay , good master Onion , what do
you mean , I pray you , sir ?
you are too
respective , in good faith .
I would not you should think so ,
sir ; for though I have no learning , yet I
honour a scholar in any ground of the earth ,
Shall I request your name , sir ?
My name is Antonio Balladino .
Balladino! you are not pageant
poet to the city of Milan , sir , are you ?
I supply the place , sir , when a worse
cannot be had , sir .
I cry you mercy , sir ; I love you
the better for that , sir ; by Jesu , you must
pardon me , I knew you not ; but I 'll pray
to be better acquainted with you , sir , I have
seen of your works .
I am at your service , good master
Onion ; but concerning this maiden that
you love , sir , what is she ?
O did my fellow Juniper tell you ?
marry , sir , she is , as one may say , but a
poor man 's child indeed , and for mine own
part , I am no gentleman born , I must con-
fess ; but my mind to me a kingdom is
Truly a very good saying .
' Tis somewhat stale ; but that 's no
O 'tis the better ; such things ever
are like bread , which the staler it is , the
more wholsome .
' Tis but a hungry comparison , in
my judgment .
Why I 'll tell you , master Onion , I
do use as much stale stuff , though I say
it myself , as any man does in that kind , I
am sure .
Did you see the last pageant I
set forth ?
No faith , sir ; but there goes a
huge report on't .
Why you shall be one of my M??cen-
asses ; I 'll give you one of the books ; O
you 'll like it admirably .
Nay that 's certain , I 'll get my
fellow Juniper to read it .
Read it , sir ! I 'll read it to you .
Tut , then I shall not chuse but like
Why look you , sir , I write so plain ,
and keep that old decorum , that you must
of necessity like it : marry , you shall have
some now ( as for example , in plays ) that
will have every day new tricks , and write
you nothing but humours ; indeed this
pleases the gentlemen , but the common sort
they care not for't ; they know not what to
make on't ; they look for good matter they ,
and are not edified with such toys .
You are in the right , I 'll not give a
halfpenny to see a thousand on 'em .
I was
at one the last term ; but and ever I see a
more roguish thing , I am a piece of cheese ,
and no Onion : nothing but kings and
princes in it , the fool came not out a jot .
True , sir , they would have me
make such plays ; but as I tell 'em , and
they 'll give me twenty pounds a play , I 'll
not raise my vein .
Oni , No, it were a vain thing and you
should , sir .
Tut , give me the penny , I care not
for the gentlemen I ; let me have a good
ground , no matter for the pen , the plot shall
carry it .
Indeed that 's right , you are in print
already for the best plotter .
I , I might as well have been put in
for a dumb shew too .
I , marry , sir , I marle you were not .
Stand aside , sir , a while .
Enter an armed sewer , some half dozen in
mourning coats following , and pass by
with service .
Enter Valentine .
How now , friend , what are you
there ?

Would you speak
with any man here ?
I , or else I must have returned you
no answer .
Friend , you are somewhat too pe-
remptory , let 's crave your absence ; nay ,
never scorn it , I am a little your better in
this place .
I do acknowledge it .
Do you acknowledge it ?
nay , then
you shall go forth ; I 'll teach you how you
shall acknowledge it another time ; go ,
void , I must have the hall purged ; no set-
ting up of a rest here , pack , begone .
I pray you , sir , is not your name
Onion ?
Your friend as you may use him ,
and master Onion ; say on .
Master Onion with a murrain ;
come , come , put off this lion 's hide , your
ears have discovered you .
Why Peter ! do
not I know you , Peter ?
Godso , Valentine ?
O can you take knowledge of me
now , sir ?
Good lord , sirrah , how thou art
altered with thy travel !
Nothing so much as thou art with
thine office : but sirrah , Onion , is the count
Ferneze at home ?
I , bully , he is above , and the lord
Paulo Ferneze his son , and madam Aurelia
and madam Ph??nixella his daughters ; but
O Valentine !
How now , man ! how dost thou ?
Faith , sad , heavy , as a man of my
coat ought to be .
Why , man , thou wert merry enough
even now .
True ; but thou knowest
All creatures here sojourning upon this
wretched earth ,
Sometimes have a fit of mourning , as well
as a fit of mirth .
O Valentine , mine old lady is dead , man .
Dead ?
I ' faith .
When died she ?
Marry , to-morrow shall be three
months ; she was seen going to heaven ,
they say , about some five weeks agone :

this news .

Juniper salutes him .
What , Valentine ! fellow Onion ,
take my dish , I prithee .
You rogue , sirrah ,
tell me how thou dost , sweet Ingle .
Faith , Juniper , the better to see thee
thus folick .
Nay , slid I am no changling , I am
Juniper still .
I keep the pristinate1 ; ha ,
you mad hieroglyphick , when shall we
swagger ?
Hieroglyphick ?
what meanest thou
by that ?
Mean ! Godso , is't not a good
word , man ?
what , stand upon the meaning
with your friends .
Puh , abscond .
Why but stay , stay ; how long has
this sprightly humour haunted thee ?
Foh , humour , a foolish natural
gift we have in the ??quinoxial .
Natural , 'slid it may be supernatural
all this .
Valentine , I prithee ruminate thy-
self welcome .
What fortuna de la guerra .
O how pitifully are these words
forc 'd ,
As though they were pumpt out on 's belly .
Sirrah , Ingle , I think thou hast
seen all the strange countries in Christendom
since thou went 'st .
I have seen some , Juniper .
You have seen Constantinople ?
I , that I have .
And Jerusalem , and the Indies ,
and Goodwin-sands , and the tower of Baby-
lon , and Venice , and all ?
I , all : no , marle , and he have a
nimble tongue , if he practise to vault thus
from one side of the world to another .
O it 's a most heavenly thing to
travel , and see countries , especially at sea ,
and a man had a patent not to be sick .

his life .

Never better , gentlemen , I faith .

Why how now , fellows ! all here ,
and nobody to wait above , now they are
ready to rise ?
look up , one or two ; signior
Francisco Colonia 's man , how does your
good master ?
In health , sir ; he will be here anon .
Is he come home then ?
I , sir , he is not past six miles hence ;
he sent me before to learn if count Ferneze
were here , and return him word .
Yes , my lord is here , and you may
tell your master , he shall come very hap -
pily to take his leave of lord Paulo Ferneze ,
who is now instantly to depart , with other
noble gentlemen , upon special service .
I will tell him , sir .

Marry , that does signior Maximilian ,

Who! Maximilian of Vicenza ?

Juniper was not designed to blunder in the expression ; pristinate appears to be the true reading , and it means that he keeps his old humour and disposition , alluding to antiquum obtinet , in Terence .

I , he ; do you know him ?
Know him ! O yes , he 's an excellent
brave soldier .
I , so they say ; but one of the
most vain-glorious men in Europe .
He is indeed marry exceeding
And that is rare .
What ?
Why , to see a vain-glorious man
Well , he is so , I assure you .
Enter Juniper .
What no farther yet ! come on ,
you precious rascal , Sir Valentine , I 'll give
you a health i' faith ; for the heavens , you
mad Capricio , hold hook and line .
My lord .
Sirrah , go up to signior Angelo ,
And pray him , if he can , devise some means
To leave my father , and come speak with
I will , my lord .
Well , heaven be auspicious in the event ,
For I do this against my genius ,
And yet my thoughts cannot propose a
reason ,
Why I should fear or faint thus in my hopes ,
Of one so much endeared to my love .
Some spark it is , kindled within the soul ,
Whose light yet breaks not to the outer
sense ,
That propagates this timorous suspect ;
His actions never carried any face
Of change , or weakness ; then I injure him
In being thus cold conceited of his faith .
O , here he comes .
Enter Angelo .
How now , sweet lord , what 's the
matter ?
Good faith his presence makes me
half asham 'd
Of my stray 'd thoughts .
Boy , bestow yourself .
Where is my father , signior Angelo ?
Marry in the gallery , where your
lordship left him .
That 's well .
Then , Angelo , I will
be brief ,
Since time forbids the use of circumstance .
How well you are receiv 'd in my affection ,
Let it appear by this one instance only ,
That now I will deliver to your trust
The dearest secrets , treasur 'd in my bosom .
Dear Angelo , you are not every man ,
But one , whom my election hath design 'd ,
As the true proper object of my soul .
I urge not this t ' insinuate my desert ,
Or supple your try 'd temper with soft
phrases ;
True friendship lothes such oily compliment ;
But from the abundance of that love that
flows
Through all my spirits , is my speech enforc 'd .
Before your lordship do proceed
too far ,
Let me be bold to intimate thus much ,
That whatsoe 'er your wisdom hath t ' expose ,
Be it the weightiest and most rich affair
That ever was included in your breast ,
My faith shall poise it , if not ?? ? ? ? ?
O no more .
Those words have wrapt me with their sweet effects ,
So freely breath 'd , and so responsible
To that which I endeavour 'd to extract ,
Arguing a happy mixture of our souls .
Why , were there no such sympa-
thy , sweet lord ,
Yet the impressure of those amble favours
I have deriv 'd from your unmatched spirit ,
Would bind my faith to all observances .
How ! favours , Angelo! O speak not
of them ,
They are mere paintings , and import no merit .
Looks my love well ?
thereon my hopes
are plac 'd ;
Faith , that is bought with favours , cannot last .
Enter Boy .
My lord .
How now ?
You are sought for all about the house within ;
The count your father calls for you .
God !
What cross events do meet my purposes ?
Now will he violently fret and grieve
That I am absent .
Boy , say I come pre -
Sweet Angelo , I cannot now insist
Upon particulars , I must serve the time ,
The main of all this is , I am in love .
Why starts your lordship ?
I thought I heard my father
coming hitherward , list , ha ?
I hear not any thing , it was but
your imagination sure .
No ?
No, I assure your lordship .
I would work safely .
Why has he no knowledge of it then ?
O no ;
No creature yet partakes it but yourself
In a third person , and believe me , friend ,
The world contains not now another spirit ,
To whom I would reveal it .
Hark ! hark !

Signior Paulo! lord Fer-
neze !
A pox upon those brazen-throated slaves ,
What are they mad , trow ?
Alas , blame not them ,
Their services are ( clock-like ) to be set
Backward and forward , at their lord 's com-
You know my father 's wayward , and his humour
Feed both his grief and his impatience .
And those affections in him are like powder ,
Apt to enflame with every little spark ,
And blow up reason ; therefore , Angelo ,

I know not , my lord .
See , call him .
He is coming this way , let 's with -
draw a little .

No, my lord .
No, my lord ! I shall have shortly

He is not , he is no where , is he ?

Why I 'll tell you , signior ,
He 'll bandy with me word for word ; nay
more ,
Put me to silence , strike me perfect dumb ,
And so amaze me , that oft-time I know not
Whether to check or cherish his presump -
tion ;
Therefore , good signior ?? ?
Sweet lord , satisfy yourself , I am
not now to learn how to manage my affec-
tions ; I have observed and know the dif -

man ; I can distinguish them ; the property
of the wretch is , he would hurt , and can-
not ; of the man , he can hurt , and will

Go to my merry daughter ; O
these looks
Agree well with your habit , do they not ?
Enter Juniper .
Tut , let me alone .
By your
favour , this is the gentleman , I think : sir ,
you appear to be an honourable gentleman ,
I understand , and could wish ( for mine own
part ) that things were conden't otherwise
than they are : but ( the world knows ) a
foolish fellow , somewhat proclive and hasty ,
he did it in a prejudicate humour ; marry
now , upon better computation , he wanes ,
he melts , his poor eyes are in a cold sweat .
Right noble signior , you can have but com-
punction ; I love the man , tender your
Doth any man here understand
this fellow ?
O god , sir , I may say frustra to
the comprehension of your intellection .
Before the lord , he speaks all
riddle , I think .
I must have a comment , ere I can conceive
Why he sues to have his fellow
Onion pardo n 'd ,
And you must grant it , signior .
O with all my soul , my lord ; is
that his motion ?
I , sir , and we shall retort these
kind favours with all alacrity of spirit we
can , sir , as may be most expedient , as well
for the quality as the cause ; till when , in
spite of this compliment , I rest a poor
cobler , servant to my honourable lord here ,
your friend and Juniper .
How , Juniper !
I , signior .
He is a sweet youth , his tongue
has a happy turn when he sleeps .
Enter Paulo Ferneze , Francisco Colonia ,
Angelo , Valentine .
I , for then it rests .
O , sir , you 're
welcome :
Why God be thanked , you are found at last :
Signior Colonia , truly you are welcome ,
I am glad to see you , sir , so well return 'd .
I gladly thank your honour ;
Yet indeed I 'm sorry for such cause of
heaviness
As has possest your lordship in my absence .
O Francisco , you knew her what
she was .
She was a wise and honourable
I , was she not ?
well , weep not ,
she is gone .
Passion 's dull 'd eye can make two griefs of one .
Whom death marks out , virtue nor blood
can save ;
Princes , as beggars , all must feed the grave .
Are your horse ready , lord Paulo ?
I , signior , they stay for us at the gate .
Well , 'tis good .
Ladies , I will
take my leave of you ,
Be your fortunes , as yourselves , fair .
Come ,
let us to horse ,
Count Ferneze , I bear a spirit full of thanks
for all your honourable courtesies .
Sir , I could wish the number and
value of them more , in respect of your
But , signior Maximilian , I
pray you a word in private .
I faith , brother , you are fitted for a
general yonder .
Beshrew my heart ( if I
had Fortunatus ' hat here ) and I would not
wish myself a man , and go with you , only
t 'enjoy his presence .
Why do you love him so well ,
sister ?
No, by my troth ; but I have such
an odd pretty apprehension of his humour ,
methinks , that I am e 'en tickled with the
conceit of it .
O he is a fine man .
And methinks another may be as
fine as he .
O Angelo! do you think I do urge
my comparison against you ?
no , I am not
so ill bred as to be a depraver of your
worthiness : believe me , if I had not some
hope of your abiding with us , I should
never desire to go out of black whilst I
lived ; but learn to speak i' the nose , and
turn puritan presently .
I thank you , lady , I know you can
Come , do you take it so ?
I faith
you wrong me .
I , but madam ,
Thus to disclaim in all the effects of pleasure ,
May make your sadness seem so much
affected ,
And then the proper grace of it is lost .
Indeed , sir , if I did put on this
sadness
Only abroad , and in society ,
And were in private merry , and quick
humour 'd ,
Then might it seem affected , and abhorr 'd ;
But as my looks appear , such is my spirit ,
Drown 'd up with confluence of grief and
melancholy ,
That , like to rivers , run through all my
veins ,
Quenching the pride and fervour of my
My honourable lord , no more .
There is the honour of my blood engag 'd
For your son 's safety .
Signior , blame me not
For tending his security so much ;
He is mine only son , and that word only
Hath , with its strong and repercussive sound ,
Struck my heart cold , and given it a deep
Why but stay , I beseech you , had
your lordship ever any more sons than this ?
Why have not you known it ,
Maximilian ?
Let my sword fail me then .
I had one other , younger born
than this ,
By twice so many hours as would fill
The circle of a year , his name Camillo ,
Whom in that black and fearful night I lost ,
( 'Tis now a nineteen years agone at least ,
And yet the memory of it sits as fresh
Within my brain as 'twere but yesterday )
It was the night wherein the great Chamont ,
The general of France , surpriz 'd Vicenza ;
Methinks the horror of that clamorous shout
His soldiers gave when they attain 'd the
wall ,
Yet tingles in mine ears : methinks I see
With what amazed looks , distracted thoughts ,
And minds confus 'd , we , that were citizens ,
Confronted one another ; every street
Was fill 'd with bitter self-tormenting cries ,
And happy was that foot that first could
press
The flow 'ry champain , bordering on Verona .
Here I (employ 'd about my dear wife 's
safety ,
Whose soul is now in peace ) lost my Camillo ,
Who sure was murder 'd by the barbarous
soldiers ,
Or else I should have heard ?? ? my heart is great ,
Sorrow is faint , and passion makes me sweat .
Grieve not , sweet Count , com-
fort your spirits , you have a son , a noble
gentleman , he stands in the face of honour ;
for his safety let that be no question ; I am
master of my fortune , and he shall share
with me .
Farewell , my honourable lord :
ladies , once more adieu .
For yourself ,
madam , you are a most rare creature , I tell
you so , be not proud of it , I love you .
Come , lord Paulo , to horse .
Adieu , good signior Francisco ;
farewell , sister .
Sound a tucket , and as they pass every one
severally departs ; Maximilian , Paulo
Ferneze , and Angelo remain .
How shall we rid him hence ?
Why well enough .
Sweet signior
Maximilian ,
I have some small occasion to stay ,
If it may please you but take horse afore ,
I 'll overtake you ere your troops be rang 'd .
Your motion doth taste well ; lord
Ferneze , I go .
Now if my love , fair Rachel , were
so happy
As to look forth .
See fortune doth me grace
Enter Rachel .
Before I can demand .
How now , love ?
Where is your father ?
Gone abroad , my lord .
That 's well .
I , but I fear he 'll presently return .
Are you now going , my most honour 'd
lord ?
I , my sweet Rachel ,
Before god she is a sweet wench .
Rachel , I hope I shall not need to
urge
The sacred purity of our affects ,
As if it hung in trial or suspence ;
Since in our hearts , and by our mutual vows ,
It is confirm 'd and seal 'd in sight of heaven .
Nay , do not weep; why stare you ?
fear
not , love ,
Your father cannot be return 'd so soon .
I prithee do not look so heavily ;
Thou shalt want nothing .
No! is your presence nothing ?
I shall want that , and wanting that , want
all ;
For that is all to me .
Content thee , sweet ,
I have made choice here of a constant friend ,
This gentleman ; on whose zealous love
I do repose more , than on all the world ,
Thy beauteous self excepted ; and to him
Have I committed my dear care of thee ,
As to my genius , or my other soul .
Receive him , gentle love , and what defects
My absence proves , his presence shall sup -
The time is envious of our longer stay .
Farewell , dear Rachel .
Most dear lord , adieu ,
Heaven and honour crown your deeds and
Faith tell me , Angelo , how dost
thou like her ?
Troth , well , my lord ; but shall I
speak my mind ?
I prithee do .
She is deriv 'd too meanly to be
wife
To such a noble person in my judgment .
Nay , then thy judgment is too
mean , I fear :
Didst thou ne 'er read , in difference of
good ,
' Tis more to shine in virtue than in blood .
Come , you are so sententious , my
Enter Jaques .
Here comes her father .
How dost
thou , good Jaques ?
God save thee , Jaques .
What should this mean ?
Rachel ,
open the door .
'Sblood how the poor slave looks ,
as though
He had been haunted by the spirit Lar ,
Or seen the ghost of some great Satrapas
In an unsavory sheet .
I muse he spake not , belike he was
amaz 'd ,
Coming so suddenly , and unprepared .
Well , let 's go .
700
more ,
At least for this affright .
What a cold sweat
Flow 'd o 'er my brows , and over all my bo-
som !
Had I not reason ?
to behold my door
Beset with unthrifts , and myself abroad ?
Why , Jaques ?
was there nothing in the
house
Worth a continual eye , a vigilant thought ,
Whose head should never nod , nor eyes once
wink ?
Look on my coat , my thoughts , worn quite threadbare ,
That time could never cover with a nap ,
And by it learn , never with knaps of sleep
To smother your conceits of that you keep.
But yet I marvel why these gallant youths
Spoke me so fair , and I esteem 'd a beggar ?
The end of flattery is gain or lechery :
If they seek gain of me , they think me rich ;
But that they do not .
For their other object ,
' Tis in my handsome daughter , if it be :
And , by your leave , her handsomeness may
tell them
My beggary counterfeits , and that her neatness
Flows from some store of wealth , that breaks
my coffers
With this same engine , love to mine own breed ;
But this is answer 'd : Beggars will keep fine
Their daughters , being fair , though them -
selves pine .
Well , then it is for her ; I , 'tis sure for her ,
And I make her so brisk for one of them ,
That I might live alone once with my gold .
O 'tis a sweet companion , kind and true ;
A man may trust it when his father cheats
him ,
Brother , or friend , or wife .
O wondrous pelf !
That which makes all men false , is true it -
But now this maid is but suppos 'd my daughter ;
For I being steward to a lord of France
Of great estate and wealth , call 'd lord Cha -
mont ,
He gone into the wars , I stole his treasure ;
( But hear not any thing ) I stole his treasure ,
And this his daughter , being but two years
old ,
Because it lov 'd me so , that it would leave
The nurse herself , to come into mine arms ,
And had I left it , it would sure have dy 'd .
Now herein I was kind , and had a con-
science ;
And since her lady-mother , that did die
In child-bed of her , lov 'd me passing well ,
It may be nature fashion 'd this affection ,
Both in the child and her : but he 's ill
bred
That ransacks tombs , and doth deface the dead .
I 'll therefore say no more , suppose the rest .
Here have I chang 'd my form , my name
and hers ,
And live obscurely , to enjoy more safe
Enter Rachel .
My dearest treasure : but I must abroad .
Rachel !
What is your pleasure , sir ?
Rachel , I must abroad .
Lock thyself in , but yet take out the key ,
That whosoever peeps in at the key-hole ,
May yet imagine there is none at home .
I will , sir .
But hark thee , Rachel , say a thief
should come ,
And miss the key , he would resolve indeed
None were at home , and so break in the ra -
ther :
Ope the door , Rachel ; set it open , daughter ;
But sit in it thyself , and talk aloud ,
As if there were some more in house with
thee :
Put out the fire , kill the chimney 's heart ,
That it may breathe no more than a dead
man ;
The more we spare , my child , the more we gain .
What says my fellow Onion ?
come
All of a house , sir , but not fellows ;
you are my lord 's steward : but I pray you
what think you of love , sir ?
Of love , Onion ! why it 's a very ho-
nourable humour .
Nay , if it be but worshipful , I care
Go to , it 's honourable , check not
at the conceit of the gentleman .
But in truth , sir , you shall do well to
think well of love : for it thinks well of you ,
in me , I assure you .
Gramercy , fellow Onion ; I do think
well , thou art in love , art thou ?
Partly , sir ; but I am asham 'd to say
Well , I will further it in thee to any
honest woman , or maiden , the best I can .
Why now you come near him , sir ,
he doth vaile , he doth remunerate , he doth
imperfection to your worship .
But who is it thou lovest , fellow
Onion ?
Marry , a poor man 's daughter ; but
none of the honestest , I hope .
Why , wouldst thou not have her
honest ?
O no , for then I am sure she would
not have me .
' Tis Rachel de Prie .
Why she hath the name of a very vir-
tuous maiden .
So she is , sir ; but the fellow talks
in quiddities , he .
What wouldst thou have me do in the
matter ?
Do nothing , sir , I pray you , but
speak for me .
In what manner ?
My fellow Juniper can tell you , sir .
Why as thus , sir : your worship
may commend him for a fellow fit for con-
sanguinity , and that he shaketh with desire
of procreation , or so .
That were not so good , methinks .
No, sir ! why so , sir ?
what if you
should say to her , corroborate thyself , sweet
soul , let me distinguish thy paps with my
fingers , divine mumps , pretty Pastorella !
lookest thou so sweet and bounteous ?
com-
fort my friend here .
Well I perceive you wish I should
say something may do him grace , and fur-
ther his desires , and that be sure I will .
I thank you , sir ; God save your
life , I pray God , sir .
Your worship is too good to live
long ; you 'll contaminate me no service .
Command thou wouldst say ; no ,
good Juniper .
Health and wealth , sir .
This wench will I solicit for myself ,
Making my lord and master privy to it ;
And if he second me with his consent ,
I will proceed , as having long ere this
Thought her a worthy choice to make my
Room for a case of matrons , colour 'd
black ;
How motherly my mother 's death hath made us !
I would I had some girls now to bring up ;
O I could make a wench so virtuous ,
She should say grace to every bit of meat ,
And gape no wider than a wafer 's thick -
ness ;
And she should make French curt 'sies so
most low ,
That every touch should turn her over backward .
Sister , these words become not
your attire ,
Nor your estate ; our virtuous mother 's death
Should print more deep effects of sorrow in
us ,
Than may be worn out in so little time .
Sister , i' faith you take too much
tobacco ,
It makes you black within , as y ' are without .
What true-stitch sister , both your sides
alike !
Be of a slighter work ; for of my word ,
You shall be sold as dear , or rather dearer .
Will you be bound to customs and to rites ,
Shed profitable tears , weep for advantage ,
Or else do all things as you are inclin 'd ?
Eat when your stomach serves ( saith the
physician )
Not at eleven and six .
So , if your humour
Be now affected with this heaviness ,
1 Give it the reins , and spare not , as I do
In this my pleasurable appetite .
It is precisianism to alter that
With austere judgment , that is given by na -
I wept , you saw too , when my mother dy 'd ;
For then I found it easier to do so ,
And fitter with my mode , than not to weep.
But now 'tis otherwise ; another time
Perhaps I shall have such deep thoughts of
her ,
That I shall weep afresh some twelve month hence ;
And I will weep , if I be so dispos 'd ,
And put on black as grimly then as now .
Let the mind go still with the body 's stature ,
Judgment is fit for judges , give me nature .
See , signior Angelo , here are the
ladies ;
Go you and comfort one , I 'll to the other .
Therefore I come , sir ; I 'll to the
God save you , ladies ; these sad modes of
yours ,
That make you choose these solitary walks ,
Are hurtful for your beauties .
If we had them .
Come , that condition might be for
your hearts ,
When you protest faith , since we cannot see them .
But this same heart of beauty , your sweet
face ,
Is in mine eye still .
1 Give ME the reins , and spare not , as I do . ]
She is saying , it is best to follow one 's humour , and not to check it by art and rule : and she means , that if Ph??nixella is really afflicted , she should indulge her heaviness , as long as her nature prompted her so to do ; and this sense leads us to read it , instead of me .
Give it the reins ?? ? that is , the heaviness you are now affected with .
702
O you cut my heart
With your sharp eye .
Nay , lady , that 's not so ,
Your heart 's too hard .
My beauty 's heart ?
O no .
I mean that regent of affection , madam ,
That tramples on all love with such con-
tempt
In this fair breast .
No more , your drift is savour 'd ;
I had rather seem hard-hearted ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Than hard-favour 'd ;
Is that your meaning , lady ?
Go to , sir ;
Your wits are fresh I know , they need no spur .
And therefore you will ride them .
Say , I do ,
They will not tire , I hope ?
No, not with you .
Hark you , sweet lady .
' Tis much pity , madam ,
You should have any reason to retain
This sign of grief , much less the thing de-
Griefs are more fit for ladies than
their pleasures .
That is for such as follow nought
but pleasures .
But you that temper them so well with virtues ,
Using your griefs so , it would prove them
pleasures ;
And you would seem , in cause of griefs and pleasures ,
Equally pleasant .
Sir , so I do now .
It is the excess of either that I strive
So much to shun , in all my prov 'd endea -
vours ,
Although perhaps , unto a general eye ,
I may appear most wedded to my griefs ;
Yet doth my mind forsake no taste of plea -
sure ,
I mean that happy pleasure of the soul ,
Divine and sacred contemplation
Of that eternal and most glorious bliss ,
Proposed as the crown unto our souls .
I will be silent ; yet that I may
serve
But as a decade in the art of memory ,
To put you still in mind of your own virtues ,
When your too serious thoughts make you
too sad ,
Accept me for your servant , honour 'd lady .
Those ceremonies are too common ,
signior Francis ,
For your uncommon gravity and judgment ,
And fits them only that are nought but cere -
Come , I will not sue stalely to be
your servant ,
But a new term , will you be my refuge ?
Your refuge ! why , sir ?
That I might fly to you when all
else fail me .
An' you be good at flying , be my
Nay , take away the p .
Tut , then you cannot fly .
I 'll warrant you : I 'll borrow Cu-

Mass , then I fear me you will do
strange things .
I pray you blame me not , if I suspect you ;
Your own confession simply doth detect you .
Nay , and you be so great in Cupid 's books ,
' Twill make me jealous .
You can with your
looks
( I 'll warrant you ) enflame a woman 's heart ,
And at your pleasure take love 's golden dart ,
And wound the breast of any virtuous maid .
Would I were hence ! good faith , I am
afraid
You can constrain one , ere they be aware ,
To run mad for your love .
O this is rare .
Close with my daughters , gentle -
men ! well done ,
' Tis like yourselves : nay , lusty Angelo ,
Let not my presence make you baulk your
sport ;
I will not break a minute of discourse
' Twixt you and one of your fair mistresses .
One of my mistresses ?
why thinks
your lordship
I have so many ?
Many ! no , Angelo ,
I do not think th'ast many , some fourteen
I hear thou hast , even of our worthiest
dames
Of any note in Milan .
Nay , good my lord , fourteen ! it is
not so .
By th ' mass that is't ; here are
their names to shew ,
Fourteen , or fifteen to one .
Good Angelo ,
You need not be asham 'd of any of them ,
They are gallants all .
'Sblood you are such a lord .
Nay stay , sweet Angelo , I am dis -
pos 'd
A little to be pleasant past my custom .
He 's gone , he 's gone , I have disgrac 'd him
Daughters , take heed of him , he 's a wild youth ;
Look what he says to you , believe him not ,
He will swear love to every one he sees .
Francisco , give them counsel , good Fran-
cisco ,
I dare trust thee with both , but him with neither .
Your lordship yet may trust both
them with him .
Well , go your ways , away .
How
now , Christophero ,
What news with you ?
I have an humble suit to your good
A suit , Christophero! what suit , I
prithee ?
I would crave pardon at your lord -
ship 's hands ,
If it seem vain or simple in your sight .
I 'll pardon all simplicity , Christo -
phero ;
What is thy suit ?
Perhaps , being now so old a bat-
chelor ,
I shall seem half unwise , to bend myself
In strict affection to a poor young maid .
What ! is it touching love , Christo -
phero ?
Art thou dispos 'd to marry ?
why 'tis well .
I , but your lordship may imagine
now ,
That I , being steward of your honour 's house ,
If I be married once , will more regard
The maintenance of my wife , and of my
charge ,
Than the due discharge of my place and office .
No, no , Christophero , I know thee
Good faith , my lord , your honour
may suspect it ;
But ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Then I should wrong thee ; thou
hast ever been
Honest and true , and will be still I know .
I , but this marriage alters many
men ,
And you may fear it will do me , my lord ;
But ere it do so , I will undergo
Ten thousand several deaths .
I know it , man .
Who wouldst thou have , I prithee ?
Rachel de Prie ,
If your good lordship grant me your consent .
Rachel de Prie ! what the poor
beggar 's daughter ?
She 's a right handsome maid , how poor soever ,
And thou hast my consent with all my heart .
I humbly thank your honour ; I 'll
now ask
Her father .
Do so , Christophero ; thou shalt
do well .
' Tis strange ( she being so poor ) he should
affect her !
But this is more strange that myself should
love her .
I spy 'd her lately at her father 's door ,
And if I did not see in her sweet face
Gentry and nobleness , ne 'er trust me more ;
But this persuasion fancy wrought in me ,
That fancy being created with her looks ;
For where love is , he thinks his basest ob -
ject
Gentle and noble : I am far in love ,
And shall be forc 'd to wrong my honest
steward ,
For I must sue and seek her for myself .
How much my duty to my late dead wife ,
And my own dear renown , soe 'er it sways ,
I 'll to her father straight , love hates delays .
Come on , i'faith , let 's to some exer-
cise or other , my hearts .
Fetch the hilts ; fellow Juniper , wilt thou
play ?
I cannot resolve you ; 'tis as I am
fitted with the ingenuity , quantity , or qua -
lity of the cudgel .
How dost thou bastinado the poor
cudgel with terms !
O Ingle , I have the phrases , man ,
and the anagrams , and the epitaphs , fitting
the mystery of the noble science .
I 'll be hang 'd an' he were not misbe-
gotten of some fencer .
Sirrah , Valentine , you can resolve
me now , have they their masters of defence
in other countries , as we have here in Italy ?
O lord , I ; especially they in Utopia :
there they perform their prizes and chal-
lenges with as great ceremony as the Italian ,
or any nation else .
Indeed ! how is the manner of it ,
for god 's love , good Valentine ?
Ingle , I prithee make recourse
unto us ; we are thy friends and familiars ,
sweet Ingle .
Why thus , sir .
God a mercy , good Valentine ; nay ,
go on .
Silentium bonus socius Onionus ,
good fellow Onion , be not so ingenious and
So , sir ; and how ?
how , sweet
Ingle ?
Marry , first they are brought to the
public theatre .
What ! ha' they theatres there ?
Theatres ! I , and plays too , both
tragedy and comedy , and set forth with as
much state as can be imagined .
By god 's so , a man is nobody till
he has travell 'd .
And how are their plays ?
as ours
are ?
extemporal ?
O no ; all premeditated things , and
some of them very good , i' faith ; my
master used to visit them often when he
was there .
Why how , are they in a place where
any man may see them ?
I , in the common theatres , I tell
But the sport is at a new play , to ob -
serve the sway and variety of opinion that
passeth it .
A man shall have such a con-
fus 'd mixture of judgment , pour 'd out in
the throng there , as ridiculous as laughter
One says he likes not the writing ,
another likes not the plot , another not the
playing : and sometimes a fellow , that
comes not there past once in five years , at a

in censuring as the best , and swear by god 's
foot he would never stir his foot to see a
hundred such as that is .
I must travel to see these things , I
shall never think well of myself else .
Fellow Onion , I 'll bear thy charges ,
and thou wilt but pilgrimize it along with
me to the land of Utopia .
Why but methinks such rooks as
these should be ashamed to judge .
Not a whit ; the rankest stinkard of
them all will take upon him as peremptory ,
as if he had writ himself in artibus magister .
And do they stand to a popular cen-
sure for any thing they present ?
I , ever , ever ; and the people gene -
rally are very acceptive , and apt to applaud
any meritable work ; but there are two sorts
of persons that most commonly are infectious
to a whole auditory .
What be they ?
I , come , let 's know them .
It were good they were noted .
Marry , one is the rude barbarous
crew , a people that have no brains , and yet
grounded judgments ; these will hiss any
thing that mounts above their grounded ca -
pacities ; but the other are worth the obser-
vation , i' faith .
Where be they ?

Faith , a few capricious gallants .
Capricious ! stay , that word 's for
And they have taken such a habit of
dislike in all things , that they will approve
nothing , be it never so conceited or elabo-
rate ; but sit dispersed , making faces and
spitting , wagging their upright ears , and cry ,
filthy , filthy ; simply uttering their own con-
dition , and 2 using their wryed countenances
instead of a vice , to turn the good aspects of
all that shall sit near them , from what they
Enter Martino with cudgels .
O that 's well said ; lay them down ;
come , sirs ,
Who plays , fellow Juniper , Sebastian , Balthasar ?
Somebody take them up , come .
Ingle , Valentine ?
Not I , sir , I profess it not .
Who ?
Come , but one bout ; I 'll give 'em
thee , i' faith .
Why here 's Martino .
Foh , he ! alas ! he cannot play a
whit , man .
That 's all one ; no more could
you in statu quo prius .
Martino , play with him ; every man has his
beginning and conduction .
Will you not hurt me , fellow
Onion ?
Hurt thee ?
no ; and I do , put me
among pot-herbs ,
And chop me to pieces .
Come on .
By your favour , sweet bullies , give
them room , back , so .
Martino , do not look so thin upon the matter .
Ha ! well play 'd , fall over to my
leg now : so , to your guard again : excel -
lent ! to my head now : make home your
blow : spare not me , make it home , good ,
good again .
Why how now , Peter !
Godso , Onion has caught a bruise .
Couragio! be not capricious ;
what !
Capricious ! not I , I scorn to be ca -
pricious for a scratch ,
Martino must have another bout ; come .
No, no , play no more ,
play no more .

had rather play with one that had skill by
By my troth , fellow Onion , 'twas
against my will .
Nay , that 's not so , 'twas against my
head ;
But come , we 'll ha' one bout more .
Not a bout , not a stroke .
No more , no more .
Why I 'll give you demonstration
how it came ,
Thou openedst thy dagger to falsify over
with the backsword trick , and he interrupt-
ed before he could fall to the close .
No, no , I know best how it was ,
better than any man here .
I felt his play
presently ; for look you , I gathered upon
him thus , thus , do you see ?

lock , and took it single on the head .

We have this sentiment again , expressed in the same words , in the induction to Every man out of his humour :
" Using his wryed looks ,
" In nature of a vice , to wrest and turn
" The good aspect of those that shall sit near him . "
And this shews The case is altered to have been in the number of Jonson 's earliest productions ; for we often find him repeating a thought or expression in his later plays , which he had before made use of , in some former piece .
How ! a cobweb , Martino! I will
have another bout with you .
' Swounds , do
you first break my head , and then give me
a plaster in scorn ?
Come , to it , I will have
a bout .

Would you abase yourself to speak to me ?
' Tis no abusing , father : my intent
Is to do further honour to you , sir ,
Than only speak ; which is to be your son .

To rattle out the battles of my thoughts ;
One comes to hold me talk , while t 'other

Will take his daughter from him to defame

Now it is sure this is my daughter 's neat-
ness

No, my good lord ,

Got that attire she wears from top to toe .
Why , father , this is nothing .
O yes , good my lord .
Indeed it is not .
Nay , sweet lord , pardon me , do not
dissemble ;
Hear your poor beadsman speak : 'tis re -
quisite
That I ( so huge a beggar ) make account
Of things that pass my calling .
She was
born
To enjoy nothing underneath the sun ;
But that , if she had more than other beggars ,
She should be envied : I will tell you then
How she had all she wears .
Her warm
shoes ( God wot )
A kind maid gave her , seeing her go bare -
foot
In a cold frosty morning ; God requite her .
Her homely stockings ?? ? ? ? ?
Father , I 'll hear no more , thou
mov'st too much
With thy too curious answer for thy daughter ,
That doth deserve a thousand times as
I 'll be thy son-in-law , and she shall wear
Th' attire of countesses .
O , good my lord ,
Mock not the poor ; remembers not your
lordship
That poverty is the precious gift of God ,
As well as riches ?
tread upon me , rather
Than mock my poorness .
Rise , I say ;
When I mock poorness , then heaven make
me poor .
See , here 's the count Ferneze , I
will tell him
That he may seek the sooner to redeem
God save your lordship .
You are right welcome , sir .
I would I brought such news as
might deserve it .
What ! bring you me ill news ?
' Tis ill , my lord ,
Yet such as usual chance of war affords ,
And for which all men are prepar 'd that
use it ,
And those that use it not but in their friends ,
Or in their children .
Ill news of my son ,
My dear and only son , I 'll lay my soul !
Ah me accurs 'd ! thought of his death doth
wound me ,
And the report of it will kill me quite .
' Tis not so ill , my lord .
How then ?
He 's taken prisoner , and that 's all .
That 's enough , enough ;
I set my thoughts on love , on servile love ,
Forget my virtuous wife , feel not the
dangers ,
The bands and wounds of my own flesh and
blood ,
And therein am a madman ; therein plagu 'd
With the most just affliction under heaven .
Is Maximilian taken prisoner too ?
No, good my lord ; he is return 'd
with prisoners .
Is't possible ! can Maximilian
Return and view my face without my son ,
For whom he swore such care as for himself ?
My lord , no care can change the
events of war .
O in what tempests do my for-
tunes sail !
Still wrack 'd with winds more foul and con-
trary
3Than any northern gust , or southern flawe ,
That ever yet inforc 'd the sea to gape ,
And swallow the poor merchant 's traffick up .
First in Vicenza lost I my first son ,
Next here in Milan my most dear lov 'd
lady ,
And now my Paulo prisoner to the French ;
Which last being printed with my other
griefs ,
Doth make so huge a volume , that my
breast
Cannot contain them .
But this is my love ;
I must make love to Rachel : heaven hath
thrown
This vengeance on me most deservedly ,
Were it for nought but wronging of my
My lord , since only money may redress
The worst of this misfortune , be not griev 'd ;
Prepare his ransom , and your noble son
Shall greet your cheared eyes with the
more honour .
I will prepare his ransom ; gra -
cious heaven
Grant his imprisonment may be his worst ,
Honour 'd and soldier-like imprisonment ,
And that he be not manacled and made
A drudge to his proud foe .
And here I
vow ,
Never to dream of seemless amorous toys ,
Nor aim at other joy on earth ,
But the fruition of mine only son .
He 's gone : I knew it ; this is our hot
I will believe them , I : they may come in
Like simple wooers , and be arrant thieves ,
And I not know them .
' Tis not to be told
What servile villainies men will do for gold .
O it began to have a huge strong smell ,
With lying so long together in a place ;
I 'll give it vent , it shall ha' shift enough ;
And if the devil , that envies all goodness ,
Have told them of my gold , and where I
kept it ,
I 'll set his burning nose once more a work ,
To smell where I remov 'd it .
Here it is ;
I 'll hide , and cover it with this horse-dung .
Who will suppose that such a precious nest
Is crown 'd with such a dunghill excrement ?
In , my dear life , sleep sweetly , my dear
child ,
" Scarce lawfully begotten , but yet gotten ,
" And that 's enough . "
Rot all hands that
come near thee ,
Except mine own .
Burn out all eyes that
see thee ,
Except mine own .
All thoughts of thee be poison
To their enamour 'd hearts , except mine own .
I 'll take no leave , sweet prince , great em -
peror ,
But see thee every minute : king of kings ,
I 'll not be rude to thee , and turn my back
In going from thee , but go backward out ,
With my face toward thee , with humble
None is within , none overlooks my wall ;
To have gold , and to have it safe , is all .

LORD Chamont , and your va -
liant friend there , I cannot
say , welcome to Milan ; your thoughts and
that word are not musical ; but I can say ,
you are come to Milan .
Mort dieu .
Gar??on !
Gentlemen ( I would call an em -
peror so ) you are now my prisoners ; I am
sorry , marry this , spit in the face of your
fortunes , for your usage shall be honour-
We know it , signior Maximilian ;
The fame of all your actions sounds nought
else
But perfect honour from her swelling cheeks .
It shall do so still , I assure you , and
I will give you reason : there is in this last
action (you know ) a noble gentleman of our
party , and a right valiant , semblably pri-
soner to your general , as your honour 'd
selves to me , for whose safety this tongue
has given warrant to his honourable father ,
the count Ferneze .
You conceive me .
I , signior .
Well , then I must tell you your
ransoms be to redeem him .
What think
you ?
your answer .
Marry , with my lord 's leave , here I
say , signior ,
This free and ample offer you have made
Agrees well with your honour , but not ours ;
For I think not but Chamont is as well born
As is Ferneze ; then , if I mistake not ,
He scorns to have his worth so underprised ,
That it should need an adjunct in exchange
Of any equal fortune .
Noble signior ,
I am a soldier , and I love Chamont ;
Ere I would bruise his estimation
With the least ruin of mine own respect
In this vile kind , these legs should rot with
irons ,
This body pine in prison , till the flesh
Drop from my bones in flakes , like wither 'd
leaves ,
In heart of autumn , from a stubborn oak .
Monsieur Gasper , ( I take it so is
your name ) misprise me not ; I will trample
on the heart , on the soul of him that shall
say I will wrong you : what I purpose you
cannot now know , but you shall know , and
doubt not to your contentment .
Lord
Chamont , I will leave you , whilst I go in
and present myself to the honourable count ;
till my regression , so please you , your noble
feet may measure this private , pleasant , and
most princely walk .
Soldiers , regard them
and respect them .
O ver bon ! excellenta gull , he
tak 'a my lord Chamont for monsieur Gas -
pra , and monsieur Gaspra for my lord Cha -
O dis be brave for make a me
laugh'e , ha , ha , ha ; O my heart tickla .
I , but your lordship knows not what
hard fate
Might have pursu 'd us , therefore howsoe 'er
The changing of our names was necessary ,
And we must now be careful to maintain
This error strongly , which our own device
Hath thrust into their ignorant conceits ;
For should we ( on the taste of this good
fortune )
Appear ourselves , 'twould both create in
them
A kind of jealousy , and perchance invert
Those honourable courses they intend .
True , my dear Gasper ; but this
hang-by here
Will ( at one time or other ) on my soul ,
Discover us .
A secret in his mouth
Is like a wild bird put into a cage ,
Whose door no sooner opens , but 'tis out .
But , sirrah , if I may but know
Thou utter 'st it .
Utteria vat , monsieur ?
That he is Jasper , and I true Cha -
O pardonne moy , fore my tongue
shall put out de secreta ,
Shall breed de cankra in my mouth .
Speak not so loud , Pacue .
Foe , you shall hear fool , for all your
long ear , reguard monsieur : you be de
Chamont , Chamont be Gaspra .
Enter Count Ferneze , Maximilian , Francisco ,
Aurelia , Ph??nixella , Finio .
Peace , here comes Maximilian .
O belike that 's the count Ferneze ,
that old man .
Are those his daughters , trow ?
I sure , I think they are .
Fore god , the taller is a gallant lady .
So are they both , believe me .
True , my honourable lord , that
Chamont was the father of this man .
O that may be , for when I lost
my son ,
This was but young , it seems .
Faith , had Camillo liv 'd ,
He had been much about his years , my
He had indeed .
Well , speak no
more of him .
Signior , perceive you the error ?
'twas no good office in us to stretch the re -
Count Fer-
neze , let summer sit in your eye ; look
chearfully , sweet count ; will you do me
the honour to confine this noble spirit within
the circle of your arms ?
Honour 'd Chamont , reach me
your valiant hand ;
I could have wish 'd some happier accident
Had made the way unto this mutual know -
ledge
Which either of us now must take of other ;
But sure it is the pleasure of our fates ,
That we should thus be rack 'd on fortune 's
Let us prepare with steeled patience
To tread on torment , and with minds con-
firm 'd ,
Welcome the worst of envy .
Noble lord , 'tis thus .
I have here
( in mine honour ) set this gentleman free ,
without ransom ; he is now himself , his va -
lour hath deserved it , in the eye of my judg-
Monsieur Gasper , you are dear to
me : fortuna non mutat genus .
But to the
main , if it may square with your lordship 's
liking , his love , I could desire that he were
now instantly employed to your noble ge -
neral in the exchange of Ferneze for your-
self , it is the business that requires the tender
hand of a friend .
I , and it would be with more
speed effected , if he would undertake it .
True , my lord .
Monsieur Gasper ,
how stand you affected to this motion ?
My duty must attend his lordship 's
What says the lord Chamont ?
My will doth then approve what
these have urg 'd .
Why there is good harmony , good
musick in this .
Monsieur Gasper , you shall
protract no time , only I will give you a bowl
of rich wine to the health of your general ,
another to the success of your journey , and
a third to the love of my sword .
Why how now , sister , in a motly
muse ?
Go to , there 's somewhat in the wind , I see .
Faith , this brown study suits not with your
black ;
Your habit and your thoughts are of two
Good faith , methinks that this young
lord Chamont
Favours my mother , sister , does he not ?
A motherly conceit ; O blind ex -
cuse ,
Blinder than love himself .
Well , sister , well ;
Cupid has ta'en his stand in both your eyes ,
The case is alter 'd .
And what of that ?
Nay , nothing but a saint .
Another Bridget , one that for a face
Would put down Vesta , in whose looks doth
swim
The very sweetest cream of modesty .
You to turn tippet ! fie , fie ; will you give
A packing penny to virginity .
I thought you 'd dwell so long in Cyprus
isle ,
You 'd worship madam Venus at the length :
But come , the strongest fall , and why not
you ?
Nay , do not frown .
Go , go , you fool .
Well , I may jest , or so ; but Cupid
knows
My taking is as bad , or worse than hers .
O , monsieur Gasper , if thou be 'st a man ,
Be not afraid to court me ; do but speak ,
Challenge thy right , and wear it ; for I swear ,
Till thou arriv 'dst , ne 'er came affection
Enter Pacue , Finio .
Come on , my sweet finical Pacue ,
the very prime
Of pages , here 's an excellent place for us to
practise in ;
Nobody sees us here ; come , let 's to it .

Contenta ; reguarde vou le premier .
Sirrah , Finio .
Mort dieu le pesant .
Didst thou see Valentine ?
Valentine ! no ,
No!
Sirrah , Onion , whither goest ?

Monsieur Pacue .

Jesu ! by ga , who think we shall
meete here ?
By this hand , I am not a little proud
of it , sir .
This trick is only for the chamber ,
it cannot be cleverly done abroad .
Well , what say you for dis den ,

Young gentlemen , spirits of blood ,

ton , do Onion a good turn now .
Que que , parla monsieur , what ist ?
Faith , teach me one of these tricks .
O me shall do presently ; stand you

Nay , then you wrong me .
Well , and ever I come to be great ?? ?
You be big enough for de Onion
I mean a great man .
Then thou 'dst be a monster .
Well , god knows not what fortune
may do , command me , use me from the
soul to the crown , and the crown to the
soul ; meaning not only from the crown of
the head , and the sole of the foot , but also
the foot of the mind and the crowns of the
I cannot stay now , young gentle -
men , but ?? ? ? ? ? time was , time is , and time
shall be .
Enter Chamont , Camillo .
Sweet Gasper , I am sorry we must
part ;
But strong necessity enforces it .
Let not the time seem long unto my friend ,
Till my return ; for by our love I swear
( The sacred sphere wherein our souls are
knit )
I will endeavour to effect this business
With all industrious care and happy speed .
My lord , these circumstances would
come well
To one less capable of your desert
Than I , in whom your merit is confirm 'd
With such authentical and grounded proofs .
Well , I will use no more .
Gasper ,
Farewell , my honour 'd lord .
Commend me to the lady , my
good Gasper .
I had remember 'd that , had not
you urg 'd it .
Once more adieu , sweet Gasper .
My good lord .
Thy virtues are more precious than
thy name ;
Kind gentleman , I would not sell thy love
For all the earthly objects that mine eyes
Have ever tasted .
Sure thou art nobly
born ,
However fortune hath obscur 'd thy birth ;
For native honour sparkles in thine eyes .
How may I bless the time wherein Cha -
mont ,
My honour 'd father , did surprize Vicenza ,
Where this my friend ( known by no name )
was found ,
Being then a child , and scarce of power to
speak ,
To whom my father gave this name of Gasper ,
And as his own respected him to death ;
Since when we two have shar 'd our mutual
fortunes
With equal spirits , and but death 's rude hand ,
No violence shall dissolve the sacred band .
Enter Juniper in his shop , singing .
To him
Fellow , Juniper , no more of thy
songs and sonnets ; sweet Juniper , no more
of thy hymns and madrigals ; thou sing 'st ,
but I sigh .
What 's the matter , Peter , ha ?
what in an academy still ! still in sable and
black costly array , ha ?
Prithee rise , mount , mount , sweet
Juniper ; for I go down the wind , and yet I
puff , for I am vext .
Ha , bully ! vext ! what , intoxi-
cate ! is thy brain in a quintessence , an
idea , a metamorphosis , an apology , ha ,
rogue ?
Come , this love feeds upon thee , I
see by thy cheeks , and drinks healths of
vermilion tears , I see by thine eyes .
I confess Cupid 's carouse , he plays
super negulum with my liquor of life .
Tut , thou art a goose to be Cupid 's
gull ; go to ; no more of this contempla -
tions and calculations ; mourn not , for Ra -
chel 's thine own .
For that let the higher powers work ;
but sweet Juniper , I am not sad for her , and
yet for her in a second person , or if not , yet
so in a third .
How ! second person ! away ,
In the crotchets already ! longitude
and latitude ! what second ?
what person ?
ha ?
Juniper , I 'll bewray myself before
thee , for thy company is sweet unto me ;
but I must intreat thy helping hand in the
Tut , no more of this surquedry ;
I am thine own ad unguem , upsie freeze1 ;
pell mell , come , what case ?
what case ?
For the case , it may be any man 's
case , as well as mine .
Rachel I mean ;
but I 'll meddle with her anon ; in the mean
time , Valentine is the man has wronged
How ! my Ingle wrong thee ! is't
possible !
Your Ingle ! hang him , infidel .
Well , and if I be not revenged on him , let
Peter Onion ( by the infernal gods ) be turned
to a leek , or a scalion .
I spake to him for a
ditty for this handkerchief .
Why , has he not done it ?
Done it ! not a verse , by this hand .
O in diebus illis ! O preposterous !
well , come , be blith ; the best inditer of
them all is sometimes dull .
Fellow Onion ,
pardon mine Ingle ; he is a man has imper-
fections and declinations , as other men
have ; his muse sometimes cannot curvet ,
nor prognosticate and come off , as it should ;
no matter , I 'll hammer out a paraphrase for
thee myself .
No, sweet Juniper , no ; danger doth
breed delay ; love makes me choleric , I
can bear no longer .
Not bear what ?
my mad meridian
Not bear what ?
Cupid 's burden , 'tis too heavy , too
tolerable ; and as for the handkerchief and
the posie , I will not trouble thee ; but if
thou wilt go with me into her father 's back -
side , old Jaques ' back-side , and speak for me
to Rachel , I will not be ingratitude ; the old
man is abroad and all .
Art thou sure on't ?
As sure an obligation .
Let 's away then ; come , we spend
time in a vain circumference ; trade , I
casheer thee till to-morrow : fellow Onion ,
for thy sake I finish this workiday .
God a mercy , and for thy sake I 'll
at any time make a holiday .
Enter Angelo , Rachel .
Nay , I prithee , Rachel , I come to
comfort thee ,
Be not so sad .
O signior Angelo ,
No comfort but his presence can remove
This sadness from my heart .
Nay , then you 're fond ,
And what that strength of judgment and
election
That should be attendant on your years and
Will you , because your lord is taken prisoner ,
Blubber and weep , and keep a peevish stir ,
As though you would turn turtle with the
news ?
Come , come , be wise .
'Sblood say your
lord should die ,
And you go mar your face as you begin ,
What would you do , trow ?
who would
care for you ?
But this it is , when nature will bestow
Her gifts on such as know not how to use
them ;
You shall have some , that had they but once
quarter
Of your fair beauty , they would make it
shew
A little otherwise than you do this ,
Or they would see the painter twice an
hour ;
And I commend them I , that can use art
With such judicial practice .
You talk idly ;
If this be your best comfort , keep it still ,
My senses cannot feed on such sour cates .
And why , sweet heart ?
Nay , leave , good signior .
Come , I have sweeter viands yet
in store .
Enter Onion and Juniper .
In any case , mistress Rachel .
Rachel !
God 's pity , signior Angelo , I hear
my father ; away for God 's sake .
'Sblood , I am bewitch 'd , I think ;
this is twice now I have been served thus .
Pray God he meet him not .
O brave ! she 's yonder : O ter-
rible ! she 's gone .
Yea , so nimble in your dilemmas ,
and your hyperboles !
Hay my love ! O my love at the first sight ,
by the mass !
O how she scudded ! O sweet scud ,
how she tripped ! O delicate trip and go !
Come , thou art enamoured with
the influence of her profundity ; but , sirrah ,
hark a little .
O rare ! what ?
what ?
passing ,
i'faith ! what is't ?
what is't ?
What wilt thou say now , if Rachel
stand now , and play hity-tity through the
key-hole , to behold the equipage of thy
person ?
O sweet equipage ! try , good Ju-
niper , tickle her , talk , talk ; O rare !
Mistress Rachel , ( watch then if her
father come ; )
Rachel ! Madona ! Rachel ! No.
Say I am here ; Onion , or Peter , or
No, I 'll knock ; we 'll not stand

This last phrase is of the same meaning with upsee Dutch , which occurs in the Alchemist , and is there explained .

the matter .
Well said , sweet Juniper .
Hori-
zons ! hang 'em , knock , knock .
Who 's there ! father ?
Father ! no ; and yet a father , if
you 'll please to be a mother .
Well said , Juniper ; to her again ; a
smack or two more of the mother .
Do you hear , sweet soul , sweet
radamant , sweet mathavel ?
one word , Mel-
pomene , are you at leisure ?
At leisure ! what to do ?
To do what ! to do nothing , but
to be liable to the extasy of true love 's exi-
gent , or so ; you smell my meaning .
Smell ! filthy , fellow Juniper , filthy .
Smell ! O most odious !
How filthy ?
Filthy by this finger .
Smell ! smell
a rat , smell a pudding .
Away , these tricks
are for trulls ; a plain wench loves plain
dealing ; I 'll upon her myself , smell to
march-pain wench .
With all my heart ; I 'll be legiti-
mate and silent as an apple-squire ; I 'll see
nothing , and say nothing .
Sweet heart ! sweet heart !
And bag pudding , ha , ha , ha .
Jaques within .
What Rachel ! my girl ,
what Rachel !
God 's lid .
What Rachel !
Here I am .
What rakehel calls Rachel ?
Otreason to my love !
It 's her father , on my life ! how
shall we intrench and edify ourselves from
him ?
O coney-catching Cupid !
Enter Jaques .
How is my back-side ?
where ?
what
come they for ?
What are they ?
Rachel ! thieves ! thieves !
Stay , villain , slave .
Rachel , untie my dog .
Nay , thief , thou canst not 'scape .
I pray you , sir .
Ah pitiful Onion ! that thou hadst a
Why Rachel ! when I say , let loose
my dog ,
Garlick , my mastiff , let him loose , I say .
For god 's sake hear me speak ,
keep up your cur .
I fear not Garlick , he 'll not bite
Onion his kinsman ; pray God he come out ,
and then they 'll not smell me .
Well then deliver ; come , deliver ,
What should I deliver ?
O thou wouldst have me tell thee ,
wouldst thou ?
Shew me thy hands , what
hast thou in thy hands ?
Here be my hands .
Stay , are thy fingers-ends begrim 'd
with dirt ?
no , thou hast wip 'd them .
Wip 'd them !
I , thou villain ; thou art a subtil
Put off thy shoes ; come , I will see
them ;2 give me a knife here , Rachel , I 'll
rip the soles .
No matter , he 's a cobler , he can
mend them .
What , are you mad ?
are you de-
testable ?
would you make an anatomy of
me ?
think you I am not true orthography ?
Orthography , anatomy !
For God 's sake be not so invio-
lable , I am no ambuscado ; what predica -
ment call you this ?
why do you intimate so
much ?
I can feel nothing .
By 'r lady , but Onion feels something .
Soft , sir , you are not yet gone ;
shake your legs , come , and your arms , be
brief : stay , let me see these drums , these
kilderkins , these bombard slops , what is it
charms 'em so .
Nothing but hair .
That 's true , I had almost forgot this
rug , this hedgehog 's nest , this hay-mow ,
this bear 's-skin , this heath , this furze-bush .
O let me go , you tear my hair ,
you revolve my brains and understanding .
Heart , thou art somewhat eas 'd ;
half of my fear
Hath ta'en his leave of me , the other half
Still keeps possession in despight of hope ,
Until these amorous eyes court my fair
Dear , I come to thee ; friend , why art not
not gone ?
Avoid , my soul 's vexation ; Satan , hence ;
Why do 'st thou stare on me ?
why do 'st
thou stay !

Wip 'd them !
I , thou villain ; thou art a subtil knave .

We said before , that Jonson , in the character of Jaques , hath copied the Euclio of Plautus ; and this scene is an imitation of the Latin , where Strobilus is examined by the miser in the like manner .
But the pleasantries of this scene are within the bounds of nature ; and severer judgment instructed Jonson not to outrage his characters , as Plautus did before him .
Jaques examines both the hands of Juniper , but he does not , like Euclio , bid him produce his third hand .

Rachel , send Gar-

I am gone , sir , I am gone ; for

Pack ; and thank God thou 'scap 'st
so well away .

Within me and without me ; first I think 'em ,

And drink it greedily with both mine eyes :

Though you break mine .

adieu , adieu ,
My feet part from you , but my soul dwells
with you .

O fortune my friend ,
and not fortune my foe ,
I come down to embrace thee , and kiss thy
great toe .

Fellow Onion ! Peter !
Fellow Juniper .
What 's the old panurgo gone , de-
parted cosmografied , ha ?
O , I ; and hark , sirrah .
Shall I tell
him ?
Nay , be brief , and declare ; stand
not upon conundrums now : thou knowest
what contagious speeches I have suffered for
thy sake , and he should come again and in-
vent me here .
He says true , it was for my sake , I
will tell him .
Sirrah , Juniper ! and yet I
will not .
What sayest thou , sweet Onion ?
And thou hadst smelt the scent of
me when I was in the tree , thou wouldst not
have said so : but , sirrah , the case is altered
with me , my heart has given love a box of
the ear , made him kick up his heels , i'faith .
Sayest thou me so , mad Greek !
how haps it ?
how chances it ?
I cannot hold it , Juniper ; have an
eye , look , have an eye to the door ; the old
proverb 's true , I see , Gold is but muck .
Nay , godso , Juniper , to the door ; an
eye to the main chance ; here , you slave ,
have an eye .
O inexorable ! O infallible ! O in-
tricate , divine , and superficial fortune !
Nay , it will be sufficient anon ;
here , look here !
O insolent good luck ! how didst
thou produce the intelligence of the gold
minerals ?
I 'll tell thee that anon ; here , make
shift , convey , cram .
I 'll teach you how
you shall call for Garlick again , i'faith .

I 'll go in my foot-cloth ?? ? that is , I 'll have my horse dress 'd in his caparisons and housings , as gentlemen used to ride ; and hence they were called foot-cloth nags .
?? ? ? ? ? What badge shall we give , what cullison ?
So in Every Man out of his Humour , " I'll give coats , that 's my humour : but I lack a cullisen . "
And I there observed , that no Dictionary will help us to the meaning of the word .
It seems to be something relative to a coat of arms , or a crest to point out whose livery the servants wore ; but if it ever was a term in heraldry , it is no longer in use , and now unknown to the heralds themselves .
Indeed it sometimes happens , that a variation of the spelling will direct us to the etymology and meaning of a word , which may be still retained in use , but with a little change and difference in the letters : but this supposition gives us no light here .
However , I must take leave to quote one passage from our poet , where a departure from the usual way of writing and pronunciation , led me to suspect it might possibly be a corruption , which I have since found is not so .
The passage I mean , is in his Elegy on the Lady Digby :
" With such a rarity , and not rouse art
" With all her aids , to save her from the seize
" Of vulture death , and those relentless clies ? "
The last word appeared to me either an error , or the same with claws , only varied in the spelling for the sake of rhime ; and such I have since found it to be .
For what we usually call the claws , is wrote , in Minshew , the cleyes of a crab , scorpion , &c .

What villain is the same that hath usurpt

Monsieur Gasper !

The whole incident of Paulo Ferneze 's being taken prisoner on the one side , and Chamont and Camillo on the other , with the exchanging their names , and Camillo 's being left for Chamont , is taken from the Captivi of Plautus .
The son of Hegio is taken prisoner ; and with a view to ransom his son by the exchange , Hegio buys Philocrates and Tyndarus , two Elian captives .
Tyndarus is slave to Philocrates , and is left under his master 's name , while the true Philocrates is sent to Elis , under the name of Tyndarus , to effect the liberty of Philoptolemus the son of Hegio .
The raud however is discovered to Hegio , before the return of Philocrates ; and Tyndarus is put to the torture , and sent to the mines .
At the return of Philoptolemus and Philocrates , with whom also there comes Stalagmus , a fugitive slave of Hegio , it is discovered that Tyndarus is the son of Hegio , who was carried away by Stalagmus at the age of four years , and sold by him to the father of Philocrates .
The reader will perceive from this account , the exact similitude between the copy and the original ; and I have been thus particular in pointing out the resemblance , for the assistance of those who may want the ability of comparing them together .
And by whose policy it was contriv 'd .
Speak truth , and be intreated courteously ;
But double with me , and resolve to prove
The extremest rigour that I can inflict .
My honour 'd lord , hear me with
patience ,
Nor hope of favour , nor the fear of torment ,
Shall sway my tongue from uttering of
' Tis well , proceed then .
The morn before this battle did
begin ,
Wherein my lord Chamont and I were ta'en ,
We vow 'd one mutual fortune , good or bad ,
That day should be embraced of us both ;
And urging that might worse succeed our
vow ,
We there concluded to exchange our names .
Then Maximilian took you for
True , noble lord .
' Tis false , ignoble wretch ,
' Twas but a complot to betray my son .
Count , thou lyest in thy bosom ,
Lye !
Nay , I beseech you , honour 'd gen-
tlemen ,
Let not the untimely ruin of your love
Follow these slight occurrents ; be assur 'd
Chamont 's return will heal these wounds
again ,
And break the points of your too piercing
Return ! I , when ?
when will Cha -
mont return ?
He 'll come to fetch you , will he ?
I , 'tis
You 'd have me think so , that 's your policy .
No, no , young gallant , your device is stale ;
You cannot feed me with so vain a hope .
My lord , I feed you not with a vain
hope ,
I know assuredly he will return ,
And bring your noble son along with him .
I , I dare pawn my soul he will re -
O impudent derision ! open scorn !
Intolerable wrong ! is't not enough
That you have play 'd upon me all this while ,
But still to mock me , still to jest at me ?
Fellows , away with him ; thou ill-bred slave ,
That sett 'st no difference 'twixt a noble
spirit
And thy own slavish humour ; do not think
But I 'll take worthy vengeance on thee ,
Alas , these threats are idle , like the
wind ,
And breed no terror in the guiltless mind .
Nay thou shalt want no torture , so
resolve ;
Bring him away .
Welcome the worst , I suffer for a
friend ,
Your tortures will , my love shall never , end .
Manent Maximilian , Aurelia , Ph??nixella ,
Alas ! poor gentleman , my father 's
rage
Is too extreme , too stern and violent .
O that I knew with all my strongest powers
How to remove it from thy patient breast !
But that I cannot , yet my willing heart
Shall minister , in spight of tyranny ,
To thy misfortune ; something there is in
him
That doth enforce the strange affection
With more than common rapture in my
breast :
For being but Jasper , he is still as dear
To me , as when he did Chamont appear .
But in good sadness , signior , do you
think
Chamont will e 'er return ?
Do I see your face , lady ?
I , sure , if love has not blinded you .
That is a question ; but I will as-
sure you no : I can see , and yet love is in
mine eye .
Well , the count your father
simply hath dishonour 'd me , and this steel
shall engrave it on his burgonet .
Nay , sweet signior .
Lady , I do prefer my reputation to
my life ;
But you shall rule me .
Come , let 's march .
I 'll follow , signior .
O sweet queen
of love !
Sovereign of all my thoughts , and thou fair
fortune ,
Who ( more to honour my affections )
Hast thus translated Gasper to Chamont !
Let both your flames now burn in one
bright sphere ,
And give true light to my aspiring hopes :
Hasten Chamont 's return , let him affect me ,
Though father , friends , and all the world
reject me .
Enter Angelo , Christophero .
Sigh for a woman ! would I fold
mine arms ,
Rave in my sleep , talk idly being awake ,

Pine and look pale , make love walks in the
night ,
To steal cold comfort from a day-star 's eyes .
Kit , thou'rt a fool ; wilt thou be wise ; then ,
lad ,
Renounce this boy-god 's nice idolatry ,
Stand not on compliment , and wooing
tricks ;
Thou lov'st old Jaques 's daughter , dost thou ?
Love her !
Come , come , I know't ; be rul 'd ,
and she 's thine own .
Thou'lt say , her father Jaques , the old
beggar ,
Hath paw n 'd his word to thee , that none
but thou
Shalt be his son-in-law .
He has .
He has !
Wilt thou believe him , and be made a cook ,
To wait on such an antique weather-cock ;
While he is more inconstant than the sea ,
His thoughts , Camelion-like , change every
No, Kit , work soundly , steal the wench away ,
Wed her , and bed her , and when that is
done ,
Then say to Jaques , shall I be your son ?
But come , to our device ; where is this
gold ?
Here , signior Angelo .
Bestow it , bid thy hands shed golden
drops ;
Let these bald French crowns be uncover 'd ,
In open sight to do obeysance
To Jaques ' staring eyes when he sets forth ;
The needy beggar will be glad of gold .
So now keep them aloof , and as he treads
This gilded path , stretch out his ambling
hopes
With scattering more and more , and as thou
goest ,
Cry Jaques , Jaques .
Tush , let me alone .
But first , I 'll play the ghost , I 'll call
him out ;
Kit , keep aloof .
But , signior Angelo ,
Where will yourself and Rachel stay for me ,
After the jest is ended ?
Mass , that 's true ,
At the old priory behind St .
Agreed , no better place : I 'll meet
you there .
Now to this geer , ?? ? Jaques ! Jaques !
what Jaques !
Who calls ?
who 's there ?
Jaques !
Who calls ?
Steward , he comes , he comes ,
Enter Jaques .
What voice is this ?
No body here ?
was I not call 'd ?
I was ;
And one cry 'd Jaques with a hollow voice .
I was deceiv 'd ; no , I was not deceiv 'd .
See , see , it wasan angel call 'd me forth .
Gold , gold , man-making gold ! another star !
Drop they from heav'n ?
no , no , my house ,
I hope ,
Is haunted with a fairy .
My dear Lar ,
My houshold god , my fairy , on my knees .
Jaques !
My Lar doth call me ; O sweet
voice ,
Musical as the spheres ! see , see , more gold !
Jaques !
Enter Rachel .
What Rachel , Rachel , lock my door ,
look to my house .
Jaques !
Shut fast my door ;
A golden crown , Jaques shall be a king .
To a fool 's paradise that path will
bring
Thee and thy houshold Lar .
What means my father ?
I wonder what strange humour ?? ? ? ? ?
Come , sweet soul ,
Leave wondering , start not , 'twas I laid this
plot ,
To get your father forth .
O Angelo!
O me no O 's , but hear ; my lord ,
your love ,
Paulo Ferneze , is return 'd from war ,
Lingers at Pont Valerio , and from thence ,
By post , at midnight last , I was conjur 'd
To man you thither .
Stand not on replies ,
A horse is saddled for you , will you go ?
And I am for you , if you will stay , why so .
O Angelo , each minute is a day
Till my Ferneze come ; come , we 'll away ,
Sweet soul , I guess thy meaning by
thy looks ;
At Pont Valerio thou thy love shalt see ,
But not Ferneze .
Steward , fare you well ;
You wait for Rachel too , when can you tell ?
Enter Jaques .
O in what golden circle have I
danc 'd !
Milan , these od 'rous and enflower 'd fields
Are none of thine ; no , here 's Elizium ;
Here blessed ghosts do walk ; this is the
court
And glorious palace , where the god of gold
Shines like the sun of sparkling majesty .
O my fair-feather 'd , my red-breasted birds ,
Come flie with me , I 'll bring you to a choir ,
Whose concert being sweeten 'd with your
sound ,
The musick will be fuller , and each hour
The ears shall banquet with your harmony .
O ! O ! O !
Enter Christophero .
At the old priory behind St .
Foy 's ,
I hope he will not make me lose my gold ,
And mock me too : perhaps they are within ;
I 'll knock .
O god , the case is alter 'd !
Rachel ! Angelo! signior Angelo!
Angels ! I , where ?
mine angels !
where 's my gold ?
Why Rachel ! O thou thievish Canibal !
Thou eat 'st my flesh in stealing of my gold .
What gold ?
What gold ?
Rachel ! call help ,
come forth !
I 'll rip thine entrails , but I 'll have my gold .
Rachel ! why com 'st thou not ?
I am un-
Ah me , she speaks not ! thou has slain my
What is the man possest , trow !
this is strange !
Rachel , I see , is gone with Angelo .
Well , I will once again into the priory ,
And see if I can meet them .
Enter Jaques .
' Tis too true ,
Th'ast made away my child , thou hast my gold :
O what hiena call 'd me out of doors ?
The thief is gone , my gold 's gone , Rachel 's
gone ,
All 's gone ! save I that spend my cries in vain ;
But I 'll hence too , and die , or end this pain .
Enter Juniper , Onion , Finio , Valentine .
' Swounds , let me go ; hey catso ,
catch him alive ; I call , I call , boy ; I come ,

my friend here .

couple of buzzards turn 'd to a pair of pea -
Signior Onion , lend me thy boy to

Signior Juniper , for once or so ; but
truth is , you must inveigle , as I have done ,
my lord 's page here , a poor follower of

be superintendant upon me ; he shall not be
addicted , he shall not be incident , he shall
not be incident , he shall not be incident ,

O sweet signior Juniper !
'Sblood stand away , princocks , do
not aggravate my joy .
Nay , good master Onion .
Nay , and he have the heart to draw
my blood , let him come .
I 'll slice you , Onion ; I 'll slice
I 'll cleave you , Juniper .
Why hold , hold , ho! what do you
mean ?
Let him come , Ingle ; stand by ,
boy , his alabaster blade cannot fear me .
Why hear you , sweet signior , let not
there be any contention between my master
and you about me ; if you want a page , sir ,
I can help you to a proper stripling .
Canst thou ?
what parentage ,
what ancestry , what genealogy is he ?
A French boy , sir .
Has he his French linguist ?
has
he ?
I , sir .
Then transport him ; here 's a cru-
sado for thee .
You will not imbezzle my servant
with your benevolence , will you ?
hold , boy ,
there 's a portmanteau for thee .
Lord , sir !
Do , take it , boy ; it 's three pounds
ten shillings , a portmanteau .
I thank your lordship .
Sirrah Ningle , thou art a traveller ,
and I honour thee .

rish thy muse , discourse .
Of what , sir ?
Of what thou wilt ; 'sblood , hang
Prithee , Valentine , assoile me one

Speak legibly , this game 's gone ,
without the great mercy of God .

Enter Finio , Pacue , Balthasar , Martino .
Where , where , Finio , where be
they ?
Go to , I 'll be with you anon .
O here 's the page , signior Juniper .
What says monsieur Onion , boy ?
What say you , sir ?
Tread out , boy .
Take up , you mean , sir .
Tread out , I say ; so , I thank you ,
is this the boy ?
Aue , monsieur .
Who gave you that name ?
Give me de name , vat name ?
He thought your name had been
Young gentleman , you must do more
than his legs can do for him , bear with him ,

O signior , no .

I 'll give
you good exhibition .

but shall lead you too .

for fellows , no more in occupation , no more
in corporation ; 'tis so , pardon me ; the
case is alter 'd ; this is law , but I 'll stand to

Well , then God save the duke 's
majesty ; is this any harm now ?
speak , is
this any harm now ?
No, nor good neither , 'sblood .
Do you laugh at me ?
do you
laugh at me ?
do you laugh at me ?
I , sir , we do .
You do indeed ?
I , indeed , sir .
' Tis sufficient ; page carry my
purse ; dog me .
Gentlemen , leave him not ; you see
in what case he is ; he is not in adversity ,
his purse is full of money ; leave him not .
Enter Angelo , with Rachel .
Nay , gentle Rachel .
Away , forbear , ungentle Angelo ,
Touch not my body with those impious
hands ,
That , like hot irons , sear my trembling heart ,
And make it hiss at your disloyalty .
Enter Chamont , Paulo Ferneze .
Was this your drift , to use Ferneze 's name ?
Was he your fittest stale ?
O wild dishonour !
Stay , noble sir .
'Sblood , how like a puppet do you
talk now !
Dishonour ! what dishonour ! come , come , fool ;
Nay , then I see y 'are peevish .
S'heart , dis -
honour !
To have you to a priest , and marry you ,
And put you in an honourable state .
To marry me ! O heaven ! can it
be ?
That men should live with such unfeeling souls ,
Without or touch or conscience of religion ?
Or that their warping appetites should spoil
Those honour 'd forms , that the true scale of
friendship
Had set upon their faces ?
Do you hear ?
What needs all this ?
say , will you have me ,
or no ?
I 'll have you gone , and leave me ,
if you would .
Leave you ! I was accurst to bring
you hither ,
And make so fair an offer to a fool .
A pox upon you , why should you be coy ,
What good thing have you in you to be
proud of ?
Are ye any other than a beggar 's daughter ?
Because you have beauty .
O god 's light !
a blast !
I , Angelo .
You scornful baggage ,
I lov 'd thee not so much , but now I hate thee .
Upon my knees , you heavenly
powers , I thank you ,
That thus have tam 'd his wild affections .
This will not do , I must to her
Rachel , O that thou sawest my heart , or
didst behold
The place from whence that scalding sigh evented !
Rachel , by Jesu , I love thee as my soul ,
Rachel , sweet Rachel .
What again return 'd
Unto this violent passion !
Do but hear me ;
By heaven I love you , Rachel .
Pray forbear .
O that my lord Ferneze were but here !
'Sblood an' he were , what would he
do !
This would he do , base villain .
My dear lord .
Thou monster ! even the soul of
treachery !
O what dishonour 'd title of reproach
May my tongue spit in thy deserved face !
Methinks my very presence should invert
The steeled organs of those traiterous eyes ,
To take into thy heart , and pierce it through .
Turn 'st thou them on the ground ! wretch ,
dig a grave
With their sharp points , to hide thy abhorred head .
Sweet love , thy wrongs have been too vio-
lent
Since my departure from thee , I perceive ;
But now true comfort shall again appear ,
And , like an armed angel , guard thee safe
From all th ' assaults of cover 'd villainy .
Come , monsieur , let us go , and leave this
wretch
To his despair .
My noble Ferneze .
What canst thou speak to me , and
not thy tongue ,
Forc 'd with the torment of thy guilty soul ,
Break that infected circle of thy mouth ,
Like the rude clapper of a crazed bell ?
I , that in thy bosom lodg 'd my soul ,
With all her train of secrets , thinking them
To be as safe and richly entertain 'd
As in a prince 's court , or tower of strength ,
And thou to prove a traitor to my trust ,
And basely to expose it ; O this world !
My honourable lord .
The very owl , whom other birds do
stare
And wonder at , shall hoot at thee ; and
snakes ,
In every bush , shall deaf thine ears with their ?? ?
Nay , good my lord , give end unto
your passions .
You shall see I will redeem your lost opinion .
My lord , believe him .
Come , be satisfy 'd ;
Sweet lord , you know our haste ; let us to
horse ,
The time for my engag 'd return is past .
Be friends again , take him along with you .
Come , signior Angelo , hereafter
prove more true .
Enter count Ferneze , Maximilian , Francisco .
Tut , Maximilian , for your ho-
nour 'd self ,
I am persuaded ; but no words shall turn
The edge of purpos 'd vengeance on that
Come , bring him forth to execution .
Enter Camillo bound , with servants .
I 'll hang him for my son , he shall not 'scape ,
Had he a hundred lives .
Tell me , vile slave ,
Think 'st thou I love my son ?
is he my flesh ?
Is he my blood , my life ?
and shall all these
Be tortur 'd for thy sake , and not reveng 'd ?
Truss up the villain .
My lord , there is no law to confirm
this action .
' Tis dishonourable .
Dishonourable , Maximilian !
It is dishonourable in Chamont ,
The day of his prefixt return is past ,
And he shall pay for't .
My lord , my lord ,
Use your extremest vengeance ; I 'll be glad
To suffer ten times more for such a friend .
O resolute and peremptory wretch !
My honour 'd lord , let us intreat a
I 'll hear no more ; I say , he shall
not live ;
Myself will do it .
Stay , what form is this
Stands betwixt him and me , and holds my
hand ?
What miracle is this ?
'tis my own fancy
Carves this impression in me ; my foft nature
That ever hath retain 'd such foolish pity
Of the most abject creature 's misery ,
That it abhors it .
What a child am I
To have a child ?
ah me ! my son , my son !
Enter Christophero .
O my dear love , what is become of
thee ?
What unjust absence layest thou on my
breast ,
Like weights of lead , when swords are at my back ,
That run me thorough with thy unkind
flight ,
My gentle disposition waxeth wild ;
I shall run frantick : O my love , my love !
Enter Jaques .
My gold , my gold , my life , my soul ,
my heaven !
What is become of thee ?
see , I 'll impart
My miserable loss to my good lord .
Let me have search , my lord , my gold is
My son , Christophero , think 'st
thou it possible
I ever shall behold his face again ?
O father , where 's my love ?
were
you so careless
To let an unthrift steal away your child ?
I know your lordship may find out
my gold .
For god 's sake pity me ; justice , sweet lord .
Now they have young Chamont ,
Christophero ,
Surely they never will restore my son .
Who would have thought you could
have been so careless
To lose your only daughter ?
Who would think
That looking to my gold with such hare 's
eyes ,
That ever open , I , even when I sleep ,
I thus should lose my gold , my noble lord ,
What says your lordship ?
O my son , my son !
My dearest Rachel !
My most honey gold !
Hear me , Christophero .
Nay , hear me , Jaques .
Hear me , most honour 'd lord .
What rule is here ?
O god , that we should let Cha -
mont escape .
Enter Aurelia , Ph??nixella .
I , and that Rachel , such a virtuous
maid ,
Should be thus stolen away .
And that my gold ,
Being so hid in earth , should be found out .
O confusion of languages , and yet
no tower of Babel !
Ladies , beshrew me , if you come
not fit
To make a jangling consort ; will you laugh
To see three constant passions .
Stand by ,
I will urge them ; sweet count , will you be comforted ?
It cannot be
But he is handled the most cruelly
That ever any noble prisoner was .
Steward , go chear my lord .
Well , if Rachel took her flight wil-
Sirrah , speak you touching your
daughter 's flight ?
O that I could so soon forget to
know
The thief again that had my gold , my gold .
Is not this pure ?
O thou base wretch , I 'll drag thee
through the streets ;
Enter Balthasar , and whispers with him .
And as a monster make thee wonder 'd at .
How now ?
Sweet gentleman , how too unwor-
thily
Art thou thus tortur 'd ! brave Maximilian ,
Pity the poor youth , and appease my father .
How ! my son return 'd ?
O Maxi-
milian ,
Francisco , daughters ! bid him enter here .
720
Enter Chamont , Ferneze , Rachel , Angelo .
Dost thou not mock me ?
O my dear Paulo ,
My lord Chamont !
My Gasper !
My gold , Rachel , my gold .
Somebody bid the beggar cease
his noise .
O signior Angelo , would you de-
ceive
Your honest friend , that simply trusted you ?
Well , Rachel , I am glad thou art here again .
I'faith she is not for you , steward .
I beseech you , madam , urge your
I will anon ; good Jaques , be con-
Now god-a-mercy fortune , and
sweet Venus .
Let Cupid do his part , and all is well .
Methinks , my heart 's in heaven
with this comfort .
Is this the true Italian courtesy ?
Ferneze , were you tortur 'd thus in France ?
By my soul 's safety ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? .
My most noble lord ,
I do beseech your lordship .
Honour 'd count ,
Wrong not your age with flexure of a knee ,
I do impute it to those cares and griefs
That did torment you in your absent son .
O worthy gentlemen , I am asham 'd
That my extreme affection to my son
Should give my honour so uncur 'd a maim ;
But my first son being in Vicenza lost .
How ! in Vicenza ! lost you a son
there ?
About what time , my lord ?
O the same night
Wherein your noble father took the town .
How long 's that since , my lord ?
can you remember ?
' Tis now well nigh upon the twen-
tieth year .
And how old was he then ?
I cannot tell ;
Between the years of three and four , I take it .
Had he no special note in his at-
tire ,
Or otherwise , that you can call to mind ?
I cannot well remember his attire ;
But I have often heard his mother say ,
He had about his neck a tablet ,
Given to him by the emperor Sigismund ,
His godfather , with this inscription ,
Under the figure of a silver globe ,
In minimo mundus .
How did you call your son , my lord ?
Camillo , lord Chamont .
Then no more my Gasper , but Ca -
millo ,
Take notice of your father .
Gentlemen ,
Stand not amaz 'd ; here is a tablet ,
With that inscription , found about his neck ,
That night , and in Vicenza , by my father ,
( Who being ignorant what name he had
Christen 'd him Gasper ; ) nor did I reveal
This secret , till this hour , to any man .
O happy revelation ! O blest hour !
O my Camillo!
O strange ! my brother !
Maximilian ,
Behold how the abundance of his joy
Drowns him in tears of gladness .
O my boy ,
Forgive thy father 's late austerity .
My lord , I delivered as much be-
fore , but your honour would not be per-
suaded ; I will hereafter give more obser-
vance to my visions ; I dreamt of this .
I can be still no longer , my good
lord ;
Do a poor man some grace amongst all your joys .
Why what 's the matter , Jaques ?
I am robb 'd ;
I am undone , my lord ; robb 'd and undone .
A heap of thirty thousand golden crowns
Stolen from me in one minute , and I fear
By her confederacy that calls me father ;
But she is none of mine , therefore , sweet lord ,
Let her be tortur 'd to confess the truth .
More wonders yet .
How , Jaques ! is not Rachel then
thy daughter ?
No, I disclaim in her ; I spit at her :
She is a harlot , and her customers ,
Your son , this gallant , and your steward
here ,
Have all been partners with her in my spoil ;
No less than thirty thousand .
Jaques , Jaques ,
This is impossible ; how shouldst thou come
To the possession of so huge a heap ,
Being always a known beggar ?
Out , alas !
I have betray 'd myself with my own tongue ;
The case is alter 'd .
Some one stay him here .
What means he to depart ?
count
Ferneze , upon my soul this beggar , this
beggar is a counterfeit .
Urge him : didst thou lose gold ?
O no , I lost no gold .
Said I not true ?
How ! didst thou first lose thirty
thousand crowns ,
And no no gold ?
was Rachel first thy child ,
And is she now no daughter ?
sirrah , Jaques ,
You know how far our Milan laws extend
For punishing of lyars .
I , my lord .
What shall I do ?
I have no starting-holes .
Monsieur Chamont , stand you , my honour 'd
For what , old man ?
Ill-gotten goods ne 'er thrive ;
I play 'd the thief , and now am robb 'd my-
I am not what I seem , Jaques de Prie ,
Nor was I born a beggar as I am ,
But some time steward to your noble father .
What , Melun , that robb 'd my father 's
treasure ,
Stole my sister ?
I , I ; that treasure 's lost , but Isabel ,
Your beauteous sister , here survives in Ra -
chel ;
And therefore on my knees ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Stay , Jaques , stay ;
The case still alters .
Fair Rachel , sister to the lord Cha -
mont !
Steward , your cake is dow , as well
as mine .
I see that honour 's flames cannot be
hid ,
No more than lightning in the blackest cloud .
Then , sirrah , 'tis true , you have
lost this gold .
I , worthy signior , thirty thousand
Mass , who was it told me , that a
couple of my men were become gallants of
late ?
Marry , 'twas I , my lord ; my man
told me .
Enter Onion and Juniper .
How now ! what pageant is this ?
Come , signior Onion , let 's not be
asham 'd to appear ;
Keep state , look not ambiguous now .
Not I , while I am in this suit .
Lordlings , equivalence to you all .
We thought good to be so good as
see you , gentlemen .
What , monsieur Onion !
How dost thou , good captain ?
What , are my hinds turn 'd gentle -
men ?
Hinds , sir ! 'sblood , and that word
will bear an action ; it shall cost us a thou-
sand pound a piece , but we 'll be reveng 'd .
Wilt thou sell thy lordship , count ?
What , peasants purchase lordships ?
Is that any novels , sir ?
O transmutation of elements ! it is
certified you had pages .
I , sir ; but it is known they
proved ridiculous ; they did pilfer , they did
purloin , they did procrastinate our purses ;
for the which wasting of our stock , we have
put them to the stocks .
And thither shall you two pre -
These be the villains that stole Jaques ' gold ;
Away with them , and set them with their
Onion , you will now be peel 'd .
The case is alter 'd now .
Good my lord , good my lord .
Away , scoundrel ; dost thou fear
a little elocution ?
Shall we be be confiscate now ?
shall we
droop now ?
Shall we be now in helogabolus ?
Peace , peace , leave thy gabling .
Away , away with them ; what 's
this they prate ?
Keep the knaves sure ; strict inquisition
Shall presently be made for Jaques ' gold ,
To be dispos 'd at pleasure of Chamont .
She is your own , lord Paulo , if
your father
Give his consent .
How now , Christophero! the case
is alter 'd .
With you as well as me ; I am content , sir .
With all my heart ; and in ex -
change of her ,
( If with you fair acceptance it may stand )
I tender my Aurelia to your love .
I take her from your lordship with
all thanks ,
And bless the hour wherein I was made
prisoner ,
For the fruition of this present fortune ,
So full of happy and unlook 'd-for joys .
Melun , I pardon thee ; and for the treasure
Recover it , and hold it as thine own :
It is enough for me to see my sister
Live in the circle of Ferneze 's arms ,
My friend , the son of such a noble father ;
And my unworthy self wrapt above all
By being the lord of so divine a dame .
Well , I will now swear the case is
Lady , fare you well ; I will sub -
due my affections .
Madam , as for you ,
you are a profest virgin , and I will be silent .
My honourable lord Ferneze , it shall be-
come you at this time not to be frugal , but
bounteous , and open-handed ; your fortune
hath been so to you , lord Chamont .
You are now no stranger ; you must be
welcome ; you have a fair , amiable , and
splendid lady : but signior Paulo , signior
Camillo , I know you valiant , be loving .
Lady , I must be better known to you .
Signiors , for you , I pass you not , though
I let you pass ; for in truth I pass not of you .
Lovers to your nuptials , lordlings to your
dances ; march fair all , for a fair march is
worth a king 's ransome .
