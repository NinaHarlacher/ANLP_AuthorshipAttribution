Open the Shrine , that I may see my Saint .
Hail the World 's Soul , and mine ! More glad than is
The teeming Earth to see the long 'd-for Sun
Peep through the Horns of the Celestial Ram ,
Am I , to view thy Splendor , darkning his ;
That lying here , amongst my other Hoards ,
Shew 'st like a Flame by Night , or like the Day
Struck out of Chaos , when all Darkness fled
Unto the Center .
O thou Son of Sol ,
( But brighter than thy Father ) let me kiss ,
With Adoration , thee , and every Relick
Of sacred Treasure in this blessed Room .
Well did wise Poets by thy glorious Name
Title that Age which they would have the best ;
Thou being the best of Things , and far transcending
All Style of Joy , in Children , Parents , Friends ,
Or any other waking Dream on Earth .
Thy Looks when they to Venus did ascribe ,
They should have given her Twenty thousand Cupids ;
Such are thy Beauties and our Loves ! Dear Saint ,
Riches , the dumb God , that giv'st all Men Tongues ,
That canst do naught , and yet mak 'st Men do all things ;
The Price of Souls ; even Hell , with thee to boot ,
Is made worth Heav'n .
Thou art Vertue , Fame ,
Honour , and all things else .
Who can get thee ,
He shall be Noble , Valiant , Honest , Wise ?
And what he will , Sir . Riches are in Fortune
A greater Good , than Wisdom is in Nature .
True , my beloved Mosca .
Yet I glory
More in the cunning Purchase of my Wealth ,
Than in the glad Possession , since I gain
No common way ; I use no Trade , no Venture ;
I wound no Earth with Plow-shares , I fat no Beasts
To feed the Shambles ; have no Mills for Iron ,
Oyl , Corn , or Men , to grind 'em into Powder :
I blow no subtil Glass , expose no Ships
To Threatnings of the furrow-faced Sea ;
I turn no Monies in the Publick Bank ,
Nor Usure Private .
No, Sir , nor devour
Soft Prodigals .
You shall ha' some will swallow
A melting Heir as glibly as your Dutch
Will Pills of Butter , and ne 'er purge for't ;
Tear forth the Fathers of poor Families
Out of their Beds , and Coffin them alive
In some kind clasping Prison , where their Bones
May be forth-coming , when the Flesh is rotten :
But your sweet Nature doth abhor these Courses ;
You loath the Widows or the Orphans Tears
X 2 Should
156 The Fox .
Should wash your Pavements , or their piteous Cries
Ring in your Roofs , and beat the Air for Vengeance .
Right , Mosca , I do loath it .
And besides , Sir ,
You are not like a Thresher , that doth stand
With a huge Flail , watching a Heap of Corn ,
And , hungry , dares not taste the smallest Grain ,
But feeds on Mallows , and such bitter Herbs ;
Nor like the Merchant , who hath fill 'd his Vaults
With Romagnia , and rich Candian Wines ,
Yet drinks the Lees of Lombards Vinegar :
You will not lie in Straw , whilst Moths and Worms
Feed on your sumptuous Hangings and soft Beds .
You know the Use of Riches , and dare give now
From that bright Heap , to me , your poor Observer ,
Or to your Dwarf , or your Hermaphrodite ,
Your Eunuch , or what other Houshold Trifle
Your Pleasure allows Maint 'nance ?
Hold thee , Mosca ,
Take of my Hand ; thou strik 'st on Truth in all ,
And they are envious term thee Parasite .
Call forth my Dwarf , my Eunuch , and my Fool ,
And let 'em make me sport .
What should I do ,
But cocker up my Genius , and live free
To all Delights my Fortune calls me to ?
I have no Wife , no Parent , Child , Allie ,
To give my Substance to ; but whom I make
Must be my Heir ; and this makes Men observe me :
This draws new Clients daily to my House ,
VVomen and Men , of every Sex and Age ,
That bring me Presents , send me Plate , Coin , Jewels ,
VVith hope that when I die ( which they expect
Each greedy minute ) it shall then return
Ten-fold upon them ; whilst some , covetous
Above the rest , see to engross me whole ,
And counter-work the one unto the other ,
Contend in Gifts , as they would seem in Love :
All which I suffer , playing with their Hopes ,
And am content to coin 'em into Profit ,
And look upon their Kindness , and take more ,
And look on that ; still bearing them in hand ,
Letting the Cherry knock against their Lips ,
And draw it by their Mouths , and back again .
How now !
They do bring you neither Play , nor University Show ;
And therefore do entreat you , that whatsoever they rehearse ,
May not fare a whit the worse , for the false Pace of the Verse .
If you wonder at this , you will wonder more e 're we pass ;
For know , here is inclos 'd the Soul of Pythagoras ,
That Juggler Divine , as hereafter shall follow ;
Which Soul ( fast and loose , Sir ) came first from Apollo ,
And was breath 'd into ?thalides , Mercurius his Son ,
Where it had the Gift to remember all that ever was done .
From thence it fled forth , and made quick Transmigration
To Goldy-lockt Euphorbus , who was kill 'd in good fashion ,
At the Siege of old Troy , by the Cuckold of Sparta .
Hermotimus was next ( I find it in my Charta )
To whom it did pass , where no sooner it was missing ,
But with one Pyrrhus of Delos it learn 'd to go a fishing ;
And thence did it enter the Sophist of Greece .
From Pythagore , she went into a beautiful Piece ,
Hight Aspasia , the Meretrix ; and the next Toss of her
Was again of a Whore she became a Philosopher ,
Crates the Cynick , ( as it self doth relate it )
Since Kings , Knights , and Beggars , Knaves , Lords , and Fools gat it ,
Besides Ox and Ass , Camel , Mule , Goat , and Brock ,
In all which it hath spoke , as in the Cobler 's Cock .
But I come not here to discourse of that Matter ,
Or his One , Two , or Three , or his great Oath , By Quater ,
His Musicks , his Trigon , his Golden Thigh ,
Or his telling how Elements shift ; but I
Would ask , how of late thou hast suffered Translation ,
And shifted thy Coat in these Days of Reformation ?
Like one of the Reformed , a Fool , as you see ,
Counting all old Doctrine Heresie .
But not on thine own forbid Meats hast thou ventur 'd ?
On Fish , when first a Carthusian I enter 'd .
Why , then thy dogmatical Silence hath left thee ?
Of that an obstreperous Lawyer bereft me .
O wonderful Change ! When Sir Lawyer forsook thee ,
For Pythagore 's sake , what Body then took thee ?
A good dull Moyl .
And how ! by that means
Thou wert brought to allow of the eating of Beans ?
But from the Moyl into whom didst thou pass ?
Into a very strange Beast , by some Writers call 'd an Ass ;
By others , a precise , pure , illuminate Brother ,
Of those devour Flesh , and sometimes one another ;
And will drop you forth a Libel , or a sanctified Lie ,
Betwixt every Spoonful of a Nativity-Pie .
Now quit thee , for Heaven , of that profane Nation ,
And gently report thy next Transmigration .
To the same that I am .
A Creature of Delight ?
And ( what is more than a Fool ) an Hermaphrodite ?
Now prithee , sweet Soul , in all thy Variation ,
Which Body would 'st thou chuse , to keep up thy Station ?
Troth , this I am in ; even here would I tarry .
' Cause here the Delight of each Sex thou canst vary ?
Alas , those Pleasures be stale and forsaken ;
No, 'tis your Fool wherewith I am so taken ,
The only one Creature that I can call Blessed ;
For all other Forms I have prov 'd most distressed .
Spoke true , as thou wert in Pythagoras still .
This learned Opinion we celebrate will ,
Fellow Eunuch , ( as behoves us ) with all our Wit and Art ,
To dignifie that whereof our selves are so great and special a Part .
Now very , very pretty : Mosca , this
VVas thy Invention ?
If it please my Patron ,
Not else .
It doth , good Mosca .
Then it was , Sir .
S O N G.
FOols , they are the only Nation
Worth Mens Envy or Admiration ;
Free from Care , or Sorrow-taking ,
Selves and others merry making :
All they speak or do is Sterling .
Your Fool he is your Great Man 's Darling ,
And your Ladies Sport and Pleasure ;
Tongue and Bable are his Treasure .
E'en his Face begetteth Laughter ,
And he speaks Truth free from Slaughter ;
He 's the Grace of every Feast ,
And sometimes the Chiefest Guest ;
Hath his Trencher and his Stool ,
When Wit waits upon the Fool .
O , who would not be
He , he , he ?
One knocks without .
VVho 's that ?
Away , look , Mosca .
Fool , be gone , 'tis Signior Voltore the Advocate ,
I know him by his Knock .
Fetch me my Gown ,
My Furs , and Night-caps ; say , my Couch 's changing :
And let him entertain himself a while
VVithout i' th ' Gallery .
Now , now , my Clients
Begin their Visitation ! Vulture , Kite ,
Raven , Gorcrow , all my Birds of Prey ,
That think me turning Carcass , now they come :
I am not for 'em yet .
How now ?
the news ?
A piece of Plate , Sir .
Of what bigness ?
Huge ,
Massie , and Antique , with your Name inscib 'd ,
And Arms engraven .
Good ! and not a Fox
Stretcht on the Earth , with fine delusive Sleights ,
Mocking a gaping Crow ?
ha , Mosca ?
Sharp , Sir .
Give me my Furs .
VVhy dost thou laugh so , Man ?
IThe Fox .
157
I cannot chuse , Sir , when I apprehend
What thoughts he has ( without ) now , as he walks :
That this might be the last gift he should give ;
That this would fetch you ; if you died to day ,
And gave him all , what he should be too morrow ;
What large return would come of all his venters ;
How he should worship 'd be , and reverenc 'd ;
Ride , with his Furs , and Foot-clothes ; waited on
By herds of Fools , and Clients ; have clear way
Made for his moile , as letter 'd as himself ;
Be call 'd the great , and learned Advocate :
And then concludes , there 's naught impossible .
Yes , to be learned , Mosca .
O , no : rich
Implies it .
Hood an Ass with reverend Purple ,
So you can hide his two ambitious Ears ,
And he shall pass for a cathedral Doctor .
My Caps , my Caps , good Mosca ; fetch him in .
Stay , Sir , your Ointment for your Eyes .
That 's true ;
Dispatch , dispatch : I long to have possession
Of my new Present .
That , and thousands more ,
I hope , to see you Lord of .
Thanks , kind Mosca .
And that , when I am lost in blended dust ,
And hundred such as I am , in succession ? ?
Nay , that were too much , Mosca .
You shall live ,
Still , to delude these Harpies .
Loving Mosca ,
' Tis well , my Pillow now , and let him enter .
Now , my fain 'd Cough , my Phthisick , and my Gout ,
My Apoplexy , Palsie , and Catarhs ,
Help , with your forced Functions , this my posture ,
Wherein , this three year , I have milk 'd their hopes .
He comes , I hear him (uh , uh , uh , uh ) O.
( Of all the rest ) are he , commands his love :
And you do wisely , to preserve it thus ,
With early visitation , and kind notes
Of your good meaning to him , which , I know ,
Cannot but come most grateful .
Patron , Sir ,
Here 's Signior Voltore is come ?
What say you ?
Sir , Signior Voltore is come , this morning ,
To visit you .
I thank him .
And hath brought
A piece of antique Plate , bought of S.
Mark ,
With which he here presents you .
He is welcome .
Pray him , to come more often Mos .
What says he ?
He thanks you , and desires you see him often .
My Patron ?
Bring him near , where is he ?
I long to feel his hand .
The Plate is here , Sir .
How fare you , Sir ?
I thank you , Signior Voltore ,
Where is the Plate ?
mine Eyes are bad .
I 'm sorry ,
To see you still thus weak .
That he is not weaker .
You are too munificent .
No, Sir , would to Heaven ,
I could as well give health to you , as that Plate .
You give , Sir , what you can .
I thank you .
Your love
Hath taste in this , and shall not be un-answer 'd .
I pray you see me often .
Yes , I shall , Sir .
Be not far from me .
Do you observe that , Sir ?
Harken unto me still : It will concern you .
You are a happy Man , Sir , know your good .
I cannot now last long ? ?
You are his Heir , Sir .
Am I? )
I feel me going , (uh , uh , uh , uh . )
I am sailing to my Port , (uh , uh , uh , uh ? )
And I am glad , I am so near my Haven .
Alas , kind Gentleman , well , we must all go ?
But Mosca ?
Age will conquer .
'Pry thee , hear me .
Am I inscrib 'd his Heir , for certain ?
Are you ?
I do beseech you , Sir , you will vouchsafe
To write me i' your Family .
All my hopes ,
Depend upon your worship .
I am lost ,
Except the rising Sun do shine on me .
It shall both shine , and warn thee , Mosca .
Sir ,
I am a Man , that have not done your love
All the worst Offices : here I wear your Keys ,
See all your Coffers , and your Caskets lockt ,
Keep the poor Inventory of your Jewels ,
Your Plate , and Moneys ; I 'm your Steward , Sir ,
Husband your Goods here .
But am I sole Heir ?
Without a Partner , Sir , confirm 'd this morning ;
The Wax is warm yet , and the Ink scarce dry
Upon the Parchment .
Happy , happy , me !
By what good chance , swees Mosca ?
Your desert , Sir ;
I know no second cause .
Thy modesty
Is loth to know it ; well , we shall requite it .
He ever lik 'd your course , Sir ; that first took him .
I oft have heard him say , how he admir 'd
Men of your large profession , that could speak
To every cause , and things meer contraries ,
Till they were hoarse again , yet all be Law ;
That , with most quick agility , could turn ,
And re-turn ; make knots , and undo them ;
Give forked Counsel ; take provoking Gold
On either hand , and put it up : these Men ,
He knew , would thrive , with their humility .
And ( for his part ) he thought , he should be blest
To have his Heir of such a suffering spirit ,
So wise , so grave , of so perplex 'd a Tongue ,
And loud withal , that could not wag , nor scarce
Lie still , without a fee ; when every word
Your Worship but lets fall , is a Cecchine !
Who 's that ?
one knocks , I would not have you seen , Sir .
And yet ?
pretend you came , and went in haste ;
I 'll fashion an excuse .
And , gentle Sir ,
When you do come to swim ; in golden Lard ,
Up to the Arms , in Hony , that your Chin
Is born up stiff , with fatness of the Flood ,
Think on your Vassal ; but remember me :
I ha' not been your worst of Clients .
Mosca ? ?
When will you have your Inventory brought , Sir ?
Or see a Copy of the Will ?
( anon )
I 'll bring 'em to you , Sir . Away , be gone
Put business i' your Face .
Excellent Mosca !
Come hither , let me kiss thee .
Keep you still , Sir .
Here is Corbaccio .
Set the Plate away ,
The Vulture 's gone , and the old Raven 's come .
Stand there , and multiply .
Now , shall we see
A wretch who is ( indeed ) more impotent ,
Than this can fain to be ; yet hopes to hop
Over his Grave .
Signior Corbaccio!
Yo ' are very welcome , Sir .
How do 's your Patron ?
Troth , as he did , Sir ; no amends .
What ?
mends he ?
No, Sir : he is rather worse .
That 's well .
Where is he ?
Upon his Couch , Sir , newly fall 'n asleep.
Do 's he sleep well ?
No wink , Sir , all this Night ,
Nor
158 The Fox .
Nor yesterday ; but slumbers .
Good ! He shall take
Some Counsel of Physicians : I have brought him
An Opiate here , from mine own Doctor ?
He will not hear of Drugs .
Why ?
I my self
Stood by , while 'twas made : saw all th ' Ingredients :
And know , it cannot but most gently work .
My life for his , 'tis but to make him sleep.
I , his last sleep , if he would take it .
Sir ,
He has no faith in Physick .
' Say you ?
'say you ?
He has no faith in Physick : he do 's think ,
Most of your Doctors are the greater danger ,
And worse Disease , t ' escape .
I often have
Heard him protest , that your Physician
Should never be his Heir .
Not I his Heir ?
Not your Physician , Sir . Corb .
O , no , no , no ,
I do not mean it .
No, Sir , nor their fees
He cannot brook : he says , they flay a Man ,
Before they kill him .
Right , I do conceive you .
And then , they do it by Experiment ;
For which the Law not only doth absolve 'em ,
But gives them great reward : and , he is loth
To hire his death , so .
It is true , they kill ,
With as much license , as a Judge .
Nay , more ;
For he but kills , Sir , where the Law condemns ,
And these can kill him too .
I , or me ;
Or any Man .
How do 's his Apoplex ?
Is that strong on him still ?
Most violent .
His Speech is broken , and his Eyes are set ,
His Face drawn longer , than 'twas wont ? ?
How ?
how ?
Stronger , than he was wont ?
No, Sir : his Face
Drawn longer than 'twas wont .
O , good .
His Mouth
Is ever gaping , and his Eye-lids hang .
A freezing numness stiffens all his Joints ,
And makes the colour of his Flesh like Lead .
' Tis good .
His Pulse beats slow , and dull .
Good symptoms still .
And from his Brain .
?
Ha ?
how ?
not from his Brain ?
Yes , Sir , and from his Brain ?
I conceive you , good . )
Flows a cold Sweat , with a continual Rhume ,
Forth the resolved corners of his Eyes .
Is't possible ?
yet I am better , ha !
How do 's he , with the swimming of his Head ?
O , Sir , 'tis past the Scotomy ; he now ,
Hath lost his feeling , and hath left to snort :
You hardly can perceive him , that he breaths .
Excellent , excellent , sure I shall out-last him :
This makes me young again , a score of Years .
I was a coming for you , Sir .
Has he made his Will ?
What has he giv'n me ?
No, Sir . Corb .
Nothing ?
ha ?
He has not made his Will , Sir . Corb .
Oh , oh , oh .
What then did Voltore , the Lawyer , here ?
He smelt a Carcass , Sir , when he but heard
My Master was about his Testament ;
As I did urge him to it , for your good ? ?
He came unto him , did he ?
I thought so .
Yes , and presented him this piece of Plate .
To be his Heir ?
I do not know , Sir . Corb .
True ,
I know it too .
By your own Scale , Sir .
Well ,
I shall prevent him , yet .
See Mosca , look ,
Here , I have brought a Bag of bright Cecchines ,
VVill quite weigh down his Plate .
Yea , marry , Sir .
This is true Physick , this your sacred Medicine ;
No talk of Opiates , to this great Elixir .
' Tis aurum palpabile , if not potabile .
It shall be minister 'd to him , in his Bowle ?
I , do , do , do .
Most blessed Cordial .
This will recover him .
Yes , do , do , do .
I think it were not best , Sir .
VVhat ?
To recover him .
O , no , no , no ; by no means .
VVhy , Sir , this
VVill work some strange effect , if he but feel it .
' Tis true , therefore forbear , I 'll take my venture :
Give me 't again .
At no hand ; pardon me ;
You shall not do your self that wrong , Sir . I
VVill so advise you , you shall have it all .
How ?
All , Sir , 'tis your right , your own ; no Man
Can claim a part : 'tis yours , without a rival ,
Decreed by destiny .
How ?
how , good Mosca ?
I 'll tell you , Sir . This fit he shall recover ;
I do conceive you .
And , on first advantage
Of his gain 'd sense , will I re-importune him
Unto the making of his Testament :
And shew him this .
Good , good .
' Tis better yet ,
If you will hear , Sir . Corb .
Yes , with all my heart .
Now , would I counsel you , make home with speed ;
There , frame a VVill ; whereto you shall inscribe
My Master your sole Heir .
And disinherit
My Son ?
O , Sir , the better : for that colour
Shall make it much more taking .
O , but colour ?
This Will , Sir , you shall send it unto me .
Now , when I come to inforce ( as I will do )
Your Cares , your Watchings , and your many Prayers ,
Your more than many Gifts , your this days Present ,
And last , produce your Will ; where ( without thought ,
Or least regard , unto your proper Issue ,
A Son so brave , and highly meriting )
The stream of your diverted love hath thrown you
Upon my Master , and made him your Heir :
He cannot be so stupid , or stone-dead ,
But out of Conscience , and meer Gratitude ? ?
He must pronounce me his ?
' Tis true .
This Plot
Did I think on before .
I do believe it .
Do you not believe it ?
Yes , Sir .
Mine own project .
Which when he hath done , Sir ?
Published me his Heir ?
And you so certain , to survive him ?
Being so lusty a Man ?
' Tis true .
Yes , Sir ?
I thought on that too .
See , how he should be
The very Organ , to express my thoughts !
You have not only done your self a good ?
But multiplied it on my Son .
' Tis right , Sir .
Stil , my invention .
' Lass , Sir , Heaven knows ,
It hath been all my study , all my care ,
( I ' e 'en grow grey withal ) how to work things ?
I do conceive , sweet Mosca .
You are he ,
For whom I labour , here .
I , do , do , do :
I 'll straight about it .
Rook go with you , Raven .
I know thee honest .
You do lie , Sir ? ?
And ?
Your knowledge is no better than your Ears , Sir .
I do not doubt , to be a Father to thee .
Nor I to gull my Brother of his Blessing .
I may ha' my youth restor 'd to me , why not ?
Your Worship is a precious Ass ?
What saist thou ?
I do desire your Worship , to make haste , Sir .
' Tis done , 'tis done , I go .
O , I shall burst ;
Let out my sides , let out my sides ?
Contain
Your flux of laughter , Sir : you know , this hope
Is such a bait , it covers any Hook .
O ,
The Fox .
159
O , but thy working , and thy placing it !
I cannot hold ; good Rascal , let me kiss thee :
I never knew thee , in so rare a humour .
Alas , Sir , I but do , as I am taught ;
Follow your grave instructions ; give 'em words ;
Pour Oyl into their Ears : and send them hence .
' Tis true , 'tis true .
What a rare punishment
Is avarice , to it self ?
I , with our help , Sir .
So many cares , so many maladies ,
So many fears attending on old age ,
Yea , death so often call 'd on , as no wish
Can be more frequent with 'em , their Limbs faint ,
Their Senses dull , their Seeing , Hearing , Going ,
All dead before them ; yea , their very Teeth ,
Their Instruments of eating , failing them :
Yet this is reckon 'd life ! Nay , here was one ,
Is now gone home , that wishes to live longer !
Feels not his Gout , nor Palsie , fains himself
Younger , by scores of Years , flatters his Age ,
With confident belying it , hopes he may
VVith Charms , like ?son , have his Youth restor 'd :
And with these thoughts so battens , as if Fate
VVould be as easily cheated on , as he ,
And all turns Air ! VVho 's that there , now ?
a third ?
Close , to your Couch again : I hear his Voice .
It is Corvino , our spruce Merchant .
Another bout , Sir , with your Eyes .
VVho 's there ?
How happy were you , if you knew it , now !
Why ?
what ?
wherein ?
The tardy Hour is come , Sir .
He is not dead ?
Not dead , Sir , but as good ;
He knows no Man .
How shall I do then ?
Why , Sir ?
I have brought him here a Pearl .
Perhaps , he has
So much remembrance left , as to know you , Sir ;
He still calls on you ; nothing but your name
Is in his Mouth : Is your Pearl Orient , Sir ?
Venice was never owner of the like .
Signior Corvino .
Signior Corvino .
He calls you , step and give it him .
H 's here , Sir ,
And he has brought you a rich Pearl .
How do you , Sir ?
Tell him , it doubles the twelf Caract .
Sir ,
He cannot understand , his Hearing 's gone ;
And yet it comforts him , to see you ?
Say ,
I have a Diamond for him , too .
Best shew't , Sir ,
Put it into his hand ; 'tis only there
He apprehends : he has his feeling , yet .
See how he grasps it ! Corv.
' Las , good Gentleman !
How pittiful the Sight is ! Mos .
Tut , forget , Sir .
The weeping of an Heir should still be laughter ,
Under a Visor .
Why ?
am I his Heir ?
Sir , I am sworn , I may not shew the Will ,
Till he be dead : But , here has been Corbaccio ,
Here has been Voltore , here were others too ,
I cannot number 'em , they were so many ,
All gaping here for Legacies ; but I ,
Taking the vantage of his naming you ,
( Signior Corvino , Signior Corvino ) took
Paper , and Pen , and Ink , and there I ask 'd him ,
Whom he would have his Heir ?
Who
Should be Executor ?
And ,
To any question , he was silent too ,
I still interpreted the nods , he made
( Through weakness ) for consent : and sent home th ' others ,
Nothing bequeath 'd them , but to cry , and curse .
O , my dear Mosca .
Do 's he not perceive us ?
No more than a blind Harper .
He knows no Man
No Face of Friend , nor name of any Servant ,
Who't was that fed him last , or gave him drink ?
Not those , he hath begotten , or brought up
Can he remember .
Has he Children .
Bastards ,
Some dozen , or more , that he begot on Beggers ,
Gypsies , and Jews , and black-Moors , when he was drunk ,
Knew you not that , Sir ?
' Tis the common Fable .
The Dwarf , the Fool , the Eunuch are all his ;
H'is the true Father of his Family ,
In all , save me : but he has giv'en 'em nothing .
That 's well , that 's well .
Art sure he does not hear us ?
Sure , Sir ?
why , look you , credit your own Sense .
The Pox approach , and add to your Diseases ,
If it would send you hence the sooner , Sir ,
For your incontinence , it hath deserv 'd it
Throughly , and throughly , and the Plague to boot .
( You may come near , Sir ) would you would once close
Those filthy Eyes of yours , that flow with slime ,
Like two Frog-pits ; and those same hanging Cheeks ,
Cover 'd with Hide , instead of Skin : ( nay , help , Sir )
That look like frozen Dish-clouts , set on end .
Or , like an old smok 'd wall , on which the Rain
Ran down in streaks .
Excellent , Sir , speak out ;
You may be louder yet : a Culvering ,
Discharged in his Ear , would hardly bore it .
His Nose is like a common shewer , still running .
' Tis good ! and , what his Mouth ?
A very draught .
O , stop it up ?
By no means .
'Pray you let me .
Faith I could stifle him rarely , with a Pillow .
As well as any Woman that should keep him .
Do as you will , but I 'll be gone .
Be so ;
It is your presence makes him last so long .
I pray you use no violence .
No, Sir ?
why ?
Why should you be thus scrupulous ?
'pray you , Sir .
Nay , at your discretion .
Well , good Sir , be gone .
I will not trouble him now , to take my Pearl .
Puh , nor your Diamond .
What a needless care
Is this afflicts you ?
Is not all here yours ?
Am not I here ?
whom you have made your Creature ?
That owe my being to you ?
Grateful Mosca !
Thou art my friend , my fellow , my companion ,
My partner , and shalt share in all my Fortunes .
Excepting one .
What 's that ?
Your gallant Wife , Sir .
Now , is he gone : we had no other means ,
To shoot him hence , but this , Volp .
My divine Mosca !
Thou hast to day out-gone thy self .
Who 's there ?
I will be troubled with no more .
Prepare
Me Musick , Dances , Banquets , all Delights ;
The Turk is not more sensual in his Pleasures ,
A Diamant ?
Plate ?
Cecchines ?
good mornings purchase ;
Why , this is better than rob Churches , yet :
Or fat , by eating (once a Month ) a Man .
VVho is't .
The beauteous Lady Would-bee , Sir ,
VVife to the English Knight , Sir Politique Would-bee ,
( This is the stile , Sir , is directed me )
Hath sent to know , how you have slept to night ,
And if you would be visited .
Not , now .
Some three hours hence .
?
I told the Squire so much .
When I am high with Mirth , and Wine : then , then .
' Fore Heaven , I wonder at the desperate valour
Of the bold English , that they dare let loose
Their VVives , to all encounters ! Mos .
Sir , this Knight
Had not his name for nothing , he is politique ,
And knows , how ere his VVife affect strange Airs ,
She
160 The Fox .
She hath not yet the Face to be dishonest :
But had she Signior Corvino 's Wives Face ?
Has she so rare a Face ?
O , Sir , the Wonder ,
The Blazing Star of Italy ! A Wench
O' the first Year ! a Beauty ripe as Harvest !
Whose Skin is whiter than a Swan all over !
Than Silver , Snow , or Lillies ! a soft Lip ,
Would tempt you to eternity of Kissing !
And Flesh that melteth in the touch to Blood !
Bright as your Gold , and lovely as your Gold !
Why had not I known this before ?
Alas , Sir ?
My self but yesterday discover 'd it .
How might I see her ?
O , not possible ;
She 's kept as warily as in your Gold ,
Never does come abroad , never takes Air ,
But at a Window .
All her Looks are sweet ,
As the first Grapes or Cherries , and are watch 'd
As neer as they are .
I must see her ?
Sir ,
There is a Guard of ten Spies thick upon her ,
All his whole Houshold ; each of which is set
Upon his Fellow , and have all their Charge ;
When he goes out , when he comes in , examin 'd .
I will go see her , though but at her Window .
In some Disguise then .
That is true : I must
Maintain mine own Shape still the same : We 'll think .
It is not Italy , nor France , nor Europe ,
That must bound me , if my Fates call me forth .
Yet , I protest , it is no salt Desire
Of seeing Countries , shifting a Religion ,
Nor any disaffection to the State
Where I was bred ( and unto which I owe
My dearest Plots ) hath brought me out ; much less
That idle , antick , stale , grey-headed Project
Of knowing Mens Minds and Manners , with Ulysses :
But a peculiar Humour of my Wifes ,
Laid for this height of Venice , to observe ,
To quote , to learn the Language , and so forth ?
I hope you travel , Sir , with License .
I dare the safelier converse ?
How long , Sir ,
Since you left England ?
Seven Weeks .
So lately !
You ha' not been with my Lord Ambassador ?
Not yet , Sir .
Pray you , what News , Sir , vents our Climate ?
I heard last night a most strange thing reported
By some of my Lord 's Followers , and I long
To hear how 'twill be seconded .
What was't , Sir ?
Marry , Sir , of a Raven that should build
In a Ship Royal of the King 's .
This Fellow ,
Does he gull me , trow ?
or is gull 'd ?
Your Name , Sir ?
My Name is Politick Would-be .
O , that speaks him .
A Knight , Sir ?
A poor Knight , Sir . Per .
Your Lady
Lies here in Venice , for Intelligence
Of Tires , and Fashions , and Behaviour ,
Among the Courtezans ?
the Fine Lady Would-be ?
Yes , Sir , the Spider and the Bee , oft-times ,
Suck from one Flower .
Good Sir Politick ,
I cry you mercy ; I have heard much of you :
' Tis true , Sir , of your Raven .
On your knowledg ?
Yes , and your Lion 's Whelping in the Tower .
Another Whelp !
Another , Sir . Pol .
Now , Heaven !
What Prodigies be these ?
The Fires at Berwick !
And the new Star ! These things concurring , strange !
And full of Omen ! Saw you these Meteors ?
I did , Sir .
Fearful ! Pray you , Sir , confirm me ,
Were there three Porpoises seen above the Bridge ,
As they give out ?
Six , and a Sturgeon , Sir .
I am astonish 'd .
Nay , Sir , be not so ;
I 'll tell you a greater Prodigy than these ? ?
VVhat should these things portend !
The very day
( Let me be sure ) that I put forth from London ,
There was a VVhale discover 'd in the River ,
As high as Wolwich , that had waited there
( Few know how many Months ) for the Subversion
Of the Stode-Fleet .
Is't possible ?
Believe it ,
' Twas either sent from Spain , or the Archdukes !
Spinola 's VVhale , upon my Life , my Credit !
VVill they not leave these Projects ?
VVorthy Sir ,
Some other News .
Faith , Stone the Fool is dead ,
And they do lack a Tavern-fool extreamly .
Is Mass' Stone dead .
He 's dead , Sir ; why ?
I hope
You thought him not Immortal ?
O , this Knight
( VVere he well known ) would be a precious thing
To fit our English Stage : He that should write
But such a Fellow , should be thought to feign
Extremely , if not maliciously .
Stone dead !
Lord ! how deeply , Sir , you apprehend it ?
He was no Kinsman to you ?
That I know of .
VVell ! that same Fellow was an unknown Fool .
And yet you knew him , it seems ?
I did so .
Sir ,
I knew him one of the most dangerous Heads
Living within the State , and so I held him .
Indeed , Sir ?
VVhile he liv 'd , in action .
He has receiv 'd weekly Intelligence ,
Upon my knowledge , out of the Low Countries ,
( For all Parts of the VVorld ) in Cabbages ;
And those dispens 'd again to Ambassadors ,
In Oranges , Musk-melons , Apricots ,
Limons , Pomecitrons , and such-like ; sometimes
In Colchester-Oysters , and your Selsey-Cockles .
You make me wonder !
Sir , upon my knowledge .
Nay , I have observ 'd him , at your Publick Ordinary ,
Take his Advertisement from a Traveller
( A conceal 'd Statesman ) in a Trencher of Meat ;
And instantly , before the Meal was done ,
Convey an Answer in a Tooth-pick .
Strange !
How could this be , Sir ?
VVhy , the Meat was cut
So like his Character , and so laid , as he
Must easily read the Cypher .
I have heard ,
He could not read , Sir . Pol .
So 'twas given out
( In politie ) by those that did employ him :
But he could read , and had your Languages ,
And to't , as sound a Noodle ?
I have heard , Sir ,
That your Babiouns were Spies , and that they were
A kind of subtle Nation , near to China .
I , I , your Mamuluchi .
Faith , they had
Their Hand in a French Plot or two ; but they
VVere so extremely given to VVomen , as
They made discovery of all : Yet I
Had my Advices here ( on Wednesday last )
From one of their own Coat , they were return 'd ,
Made their Relations , ( as the Fashion is )
And now stand fair for fresh Employment .
' Heart !
This Sir Pol .
will be ignorant of nothing .
It seems , Sir , you know all ?
Not all , Sir : But
I have some general Notions : I do love
To note , and to observe ; though I live out
Free from the active Torrent , yet I'ld mark
The Currents and the Passages of Things ,
For mine own private use ; and know the Ebbs
And Flows of State .
Believe it , Sir , I hold
My self in no small tie unto my Fortunes ,
For casting me thus luckily upon you ,
VVhose Knowledge ( if your Bounty equal it )
May do me great Assistance , in Instruction
For
The Fox .
161
For my Behaviour , and my bearing , which
Is yet so rude , and raw ?
Why ?
came you forth
Empty of Rules , for travail ?
Faith , I had
Some common ones , from out that vulgar Grammar ,
Which he , that cry 'd Italian to me , taught me .
Why , this it is , that spoyls all our brave Bloods ,
Trusting our hopeful Gentry unto Pedants ,
Fellows of out-side , and meer bark .
You seem
To be a Gentleman , of ingenious Race ?
I not profess it , but my fate hath been
To be , where I have been consulted with ,
In this high kind , touching some great Mens Sons ,
Persons of Blood , and Honour ? ?
Who be
these , Sir ?
The same .
Fellows , to mount a Bank ! did your Instructer
In the dear Tongues , never discourse to you
Of the Italian Mountebanks ?
Yes , Sir . Pol .
Why ,
Here shall you see one .
They are Quack-salvers ,
Fellows , that live by venting Oyls , and Drugs ?
Was that the Character he gave you of them ?
As I remember .
Pitty his ignorance .
They are the only knowing Men of Europe !
Great general Schollars , excellent Physicians ,
Most admir 'd States-men , profest Favourites ,
And Cabinet-Counsellors to the greatest Princes !
The only languag 'd Men of all the World !
And , I have heard , they are most lewd Impostors ;
Made all of Terms and Shreds ; no less belyers
Of great Mens favours , than their own vile Med'cines ;
Which they will utter upon monstrous Oaths :
Selling that drug , for Two-pence , e 're they part ,
VVhich they have valu 'd at Twelve Crowns , before .
Sir , Calumnies are answer 'd best with silence :
Your self shall judge .
VVho is it mounts , my Friends ?
Scoto of Mantua , Sir . Pol .
Is't he ?
nay , then
I 'll proudly promise , Sir , you shall behold
Another Man , than has been phant 'sied to you .
I wonder , yet , that he should mount his Bank ,
Here in this Nook , that has been wont t ' appear
In Face of the Piazza ! Here , he comes .
Mount , Zany .
Follow , follow , follow ,
follow , follow .
See how the People follow him ! he 's a Man
May write 10000 Crowns in Bank here .
Note ,
Mark but his Gesture : I do use to observe
The state he keeps , in getting up ! Per .
' Tis worth it , Sir .
Most noble Gent .
and my worthy Patrons , it may
seem strange , that I , your Scoto Mantuano , who was ever
wont to fix my Bank in Face of the publick Piazza , near
the shelter of the Portico , to the Procuratia , should now
( after Eight Months absence , from this Illustrious City of Ve-
nice ) humbly retire my self , into an obscure Nook of the Piazza .
Did not I , now , object the same ! Per .
Peace , Sir .
Let me tell you : I am not ( as your Lombard Proverb
saith ) cold on my Feet ; or content to part with my Commo-
dities at a cheaper rate , than I accustomed : look not for it .
Nor that the calumnious reports of that impudent Detractor ,
and shame to our Profession , ( Alessandro Buttone , I mean )
who gave out , in publick , I was condemn 'd a' Sforzato to the
Galleyes , for poysoning the Cardinal Bembo 's ? ?
Cook , hath
at all attached , much less dejested me .
No, no , worthy Gent .
( to tell you true ) I cannot indure to see the Rabble of these
ground Ciarlitani , that spred their Clokes on the Pavement ,
as if they meant to do feats of activity , and then come in
lamely , with their mouldy Tales out of Boccacio , like stale
Tabarine , the Fabulist : some of them discoursing their Tra -
vels , and of their tedious Captivity in the Turks Galleys ,
when indeed ( were the truth known ) they were the Chri-
stians Gallies , where very temp'rately they eat Bread , and
drunk Water as a wholsom Penance ( enjoyn 'd them by their
Confessors ) for base Pilferies .
Note but his bearing , and contempt of these .
These Turdy-facy-nasty-paty-lousie-fartical Rogues ,
with one poor Groats-worth of unprepar 'd Antimony , finely
wrapt up in several Scartoccios , are able , very well , to
kill their twenty a Week , and play ; yet , these meager
starv 'd Spirits , who have half stopt the Organs of their Minds
with Earthy oppilations , want not their Favourers among
your shrivel 'd , sallad-eating Artizans : who are overjoy 'd ,
that they may have their Half-pe 'rth of Physick , though it
purge 'em into another World , 't makes no matter .
Excellent ! ha' you heard better Language , Sir ?
Well , let 'em go .
And Gentlemen , honourable Gentle -
men , know , that for this time , our Bank , being thus remov 'd
I told you , Sir , his end .
You did so , Sir .
I protest , I , and my six Servants are not able to make
of this pretious Liquor , so fast , as it is fetch 'd away from my
Lodging by Gentlemen of your City ; strangers of the Terra -
ferma ; worshipful Merchants ; I , and Senators too : who , e-
ver since my arrival , have detained me to their uses , by their
splendidous Liberalities .
And worthily .
For , what avails
your rich Man to have his Magazines stuft with Moscadelly ,
or of the purest grape , when his Physicians prescribe him ( on
pain of death ) to drink nothing but Water , cocted with Ani-
seeds ?
O , health ! health ! the blessing of the Rich ! the Riches
of the Poor ! who can buy thee at too dear a rate , since there
is no enjoying this World without thee ?
Be not then so spa-
ring of your Purses , honourable Gentlemen , as to abridge the
natural course of Life ? ?
You see his end ?
I , is't not good ?
For , when a humid Flux , or Catarrh , by the muta -
bility of Air , falls from your Head into an Arm or Shoulder ,
or any other part ; take you a Duckat , or your Cecchine of
Gold , and apply to the place affected : see , what good effect it
can work .
No, no , 'tis this blessed Unguento , this rare ex -
traction , that hath only power to disperse all malignant Hu-
mours , that proceed , either of hot , cold , moist , or windy
Causes ? ?
I would he had put in dry to .
'Pray you ,
To fortifie the most indigest and crude Stomack , I
were it of one that ( through extream weakness ) vomited
Blood , applying only a warm Napkin to the Place , after the
Unction and Fricace ; for the Vertigine , in the Head , putting
but a drop into your Nostrils , likewise , behind the Ears ; a
most soveraign and approved Remedy : the Mal-caduco ,
Cramps , Convulsions , Paralysies , Epilepsies , Tremor-cordia ,
retired Nerves , ill Vapours of the Spleen , stopping of the
Liver , the Stone , the Strangury , Hernia ventosa , Iliaca
passio ; stops a Disenteria immediately ; easeth the Torsion
of the small Guts ; and cures Melancholia Hypocondri-
aca , being taken and applyed , according to my printed Re-
Pointing
to his Bill
and his
For , this is the Physician , this the Me-
dicine ; this Counsels , this Cures ; this gives the
Direction , this works the Effect : and ( in sum ) both
together may be term 'd an abstract of the Theorick
and Practick in the ?sculapian Art .
' Twill cost
you Eight Crowns .
And , Zan Fritada , pr'y thee sing a
Verse extempore in Honour of it .
How do you like him , Sir ?
Most strangely , I !
Is not his Language rare ?
But Alchimy ,
I never heard the like : or Broughtons Books .
S O N G.
HAd old Hippocrates , or Galen ,
( That to their Books put Med'cines all in )
But known this Secret , they had never
( Of which they will be guilty ever )
Y Been
162 The Fox .
Been murderers of so much Paper ,
Or wasted many a hurtless taper :
No Indian drug had e 're been famed ,
Tabacco , Sassafras not named ;
Ne yet , of Guacum one small stick , Sir ,
Nor Raymund Lullies great Elixir .
Ne , had been known the Danish Gonswart .
Or Paracelsus , with his long Sword .
All this , yet , will not do ; Eight Crowns is high .
No more .
Gentlemen , if I had but time to discourse
to you the miraculous effects of this my Oyl , surnamed oglio
del Scoto ; with the countless Catalogue of those I have
cured of th ' aforesaid , and many more Diseases ; the Pat-
tents and Priviledges of all the Princes and Commonwealths
of Christendom ; or but the dispositions of those that appear 'd
on my part , before the Signiory of the Sanit? , and most
learned Colledge of Physitians ; where I was authorized , upon
notice taken of the admirable Vertues of my Medicaments , and
mine own Excellency , in matter of rare and unknown Se-
crets , not only to disperse them publickly in this famous
City , but in all the Territories , that happily joy under the
Government of the most pious and magnificent States of Italy .
But may some other gallant Fellow say , O , there be divers
that make profession to have as good , and as experiment-
ed Receipts as yours : Indeed , very many have assay 'd , like
Apes in imitation of that , which is really and essentially in me ,
to make of this Oyl ; bestow 'd great cost in Furnaces , Stills ,
Alembecks , continual Fires , and preparation of the Ingredients ,
( as indeed there goes to it Six hundred several simples , be-
sides , some quantity of human Fat , for the conglutination ,
which we buy of the Anatomists ) but , when these Practitioners
come to the last decoction , blow , blow , puff , puff , and all flies
in fumo : ha , ha , ha .
Poor Wretches ! I rather pitty their Folly
and Indiscretion , than their loss of Time and Money ; for those
may be recovered by industry : but to be a Fooll born is a Dis -
ease incurable .
For my self , I always from my youth have
endeavour 'd to get the rarest Secrets , and book them ; either
in exchange or for Money : I spared nor cost , nor labour , where
any thing was worthy to be learned .
And Gentlemen , ho-
nourable Gentlemen , I will undertake ( by vertue of Chymical
Art ) out of the honourable Hat thot covers your Head , to ex -
tract the Four Elements ; that is to say , the Fire , Air , Wa -
ter , and Earth , and return you your Felt without burn or stain .
For , whilst others have been at the Balloo , I have been at my
Book : and am now past the craggy Paths of Study , and come
to the flowry Plains of Honour and Reputation .
I do assure you , Sir , that is his aim .
But , to our price .
And that withal , Sir Pol .
You all know , ( honourable Gentlemen ) I never va -
lu 'd this Ampulla , or Villa , at less than Eight Crowns ; but
for this time , I am content to be depriv 'd of it for six ; Six
Crowns is the price ; and less in courtesie I know you cannot
offer me : take it or leave it , howsoever , both it and I am
at your service .
I ask you not as the value of the thing , for
then I should demand of you a thousand Crowns , so the Car-
dinals Montalto , Fernese , the great Duke of Tuscany , my
Gossip , with divers other Princes have given me ; but I de-
spise Money : only to shew my affection to you , Honourable
Gentlemen , and your illustrious State here , I have neglected
the Messages of these Princes , mine own Offices , fram 'd my
Journey hither , only to present you with the Fruits of my Travels ,
Tune your Voyces once more to the touch of your Instruments , and
give the honourable Assembly some delightful Recreation .
VVhat monstrous and most painful Circumstance
Is here , to get some three or four Gazets !
Some Three-pence i'th ' whole , for that 'twill come to .
S O N G.
YOu that would last long , list to my Song ,
Make no more coyl , but buy of this Oyl .
Would you be ever fair and young ?
Stout of Teeth ; and strong of Tongue ?
Tart of Palat ?
quick of ear ?
Sharp of sight ?
of Nostril clear ?
Moist of Hand ?
and light of Foot ?
( Or I will come nearer to't )
Would you live free from all Diseases ?
Do the act , your Mistris pleases ;
Yea fright all Aches from your Bones ?
Here 's a Med'cine for the Nones .
Well , I am in a humour ( at this time ) to make a
Present of the small quantity my Coffer contains : to the Rich
in Courtesie , and to the poor , for Gods sake .
Wherefore now
mark ; I ask 'd you Six Crowns ; and Six Crowns , at
other times , you have paid me ; you shall not give me Six
Crowns , nor Five , nor Four , nor Three , nor Two , nor One ;
nor half a Duckat ; no , nor a muccinigo : Six ?
pence it will
cost you , or Six hundred Pound ?
expect no lower price , for by
the Banner of my Front , I will not bate a bagatine , that I
will have only a Pledge of your Loves , to carry something
from amongst you , to shew , I am not contemn 'd by you .
There -
fore , now , toss your Handkerchiefs , chearfully , chearfully ; and
be advertised , that the first heroick Spirit , that deigns to
grace me , with a Handkerchief , I will give it a little remem -
brance of something , beside , shall please it better , than if I had
presented it with a double Pistolet .
VVill you be that heroick Spark , Sir Pol ?
O , see ! the VVindow has prevented you .
Lady , I kiss your Bounty ; and for this timely Grace you
have done your poor Scoto of Mantua , I will return you over
and above my Oyl , a Secret of that high and inestimable Na -
ture , shall make you for ever enamour 'd on that Minute ,
wherein your Eye first descended on so mean (yet not altoge -
ther to be despis 'd ) an Object .
Here is a Poulder conceal 'd in
this Paper , of which , if I should speak to the worth , Nine
thousand Volumns were but as one Page , that Page as a Line ,
that Line as a word : so short is this Pilgrimage of Man ( which
some call Life ) to the expressing of it .
Would I reflect on the
price ?
why , the whole World were but as an Empire , that
Empire as a Province , that Province as a Bank , that Bank as
a private Purse to the purchase of it .
I will only tell you ; It is
the Poulder that made Venus a Goddess ( given her by Apollo )
that kept her perpetually young , clear 'd her Wrincles , firm 'd her
Gums , fill 'd her Skin , colour 'd her Hair ; from her deriv 'd to
Helen , and at the sack of Troy (unfortunately ) lost : till now ,
in this our Age , it was as happily recovered , by a studious Anti-
quary , out of some Ruins of Asia , who sent a Moyety of it
to the Court of France ( but much sophisticated ) wherewith
the Ladies there , now , colour their Hair .
The rest ( at this
present ) remains with me ; extracted to a quintessence : so that ,
where-ever it but touches , in Youth it perpetually preserves , in
Age restores the Complexion ; seats your Teeth , did they dance
like virginal Jacks , firm as a Wall ; makes them white as I-
vory , that were black as ? ? ?
Sir ?
No VVindows on the whole Piazza , here ,
To make your Properties , but mine ?
but mine ?
Heart ! ere to morrow I shall be new christen 'd ,
And call 'd the Pantalone Di Besogniosi ,
About the Town .
VVhat should this mean , Sir Pol ?
Some trick of State , believe it .
I will home .
It may be some design , on you .
I know not .
I 'll stand upon my Guard .
' Tis your best , Sir .
This three VVeeks , all my Advices , all my Letters ,
They have been intercepted .
Indeed , Sir ?
Best have a care .
Nay , so I will .
This Knight ,
I may not lose him , for my mirth , till night .
Where , Sir ?
Not without ;
Those blows were nothing : I could bear them ever .
But angry Cupid , bolting from her Eyes ,
Hath shot himself into me like a Flame ;
Where , now , he flings about his burning heat ,
As in a Furnace , some ambitious Fire ,
Whose vent is stopt .
The fight is all within me .
I cannot live , except thou help me , Mosca ;
My Liver melts , and I , without the hope
Of some soft Air , from her refreshing breath ,
Am but a heap of Cindars .
' Lass , good Sir ,
Would you had never seen her .
Nay , would thou
Hadst never told me of her .
Sir , 'tis true ;
I do confess I was unfortunate ,
And you unhappy : but I'am bound in Conscience ,
No less than Duty , to effect my best
To your release of torment , and I will , Sir .
Dear Mosca , shall I hope ?
Sir , more than dear ,
I will not bid you to despair of ought ,
Within a human compass .
O , there spoke
My better Angel .
Mosca , take my Keys ,
Gold , Plate , and Jewels , all 's at thy Devotion ;
Employ them how thou wilt ; nay , Coyn me too :
So thou , in this , but Crown my Longings .
Mosca ?
Use but your patience .
So I have .
Idoubt not
To bring success to your desires .
Nay , then ,
I not repent me of my late disguise .
If you can horn him , Sir , you need not .
True :
Besides , I never meant him for my Heir .
Is not the colour o ' my Beard and Eye-brows
To make me known ?
No jot .
I did it well .
So well , would I could follow you in mine ,
With half the Happiness ; and yet I would
Escape your Epilogue .
But , were they gull 'd
With a belief that I was Scoto ?
Sir ,
Scoto himself could hardly have distinguish 'd !
I have not time to flatter you , now , we 'll part :
And as I prosper , so applaud my Art .
A Juggling , Tooth-drawing , prating Mountebank ?
And at a publik Window ?
where , whilst he ,
Stood leering up like Satyrs : and you smile
Most graciously ! and fan your Favours forth ,
To give your hot Spectators satisfaction !
What , was your Mountebank their Call ?
their Whistle ?
Or were you ' enamour 'd on his Copper Rings ?
His Saffron Jewel , with the Toad-stone in't ?
Or his imbroydered Sute , with the Cope-stitch ,
Made of a Herse-cloth ?
or his old Tilt-feather ?
Or his starch 'd Beard ?
well ! you shall have him , yes :
He shall come home , and Minister unto you
The Fricace for the Moother .
Or , let me see ,
I think you ' had rather mount ?
would you not mount ?
Why , if you 'll mount , you may ; yes truly , you may :
And so , you may be seen , down to th ' Foot .
Get you a Cittern , Lady Vanity ,
And be a dealer with the Vertuous Man ;
Make one : I 'll but protest my self a Cuckold ,
And save your Dowry .
I am a Dutchman , I !
For , if you thought me an Italian ,
You would be damn 'd , ere you did this , you Whore :
Thou'ldst tremble , to imagine , that the murder
Of Father , Mother , Brother , all thy Race ,
Should follow , as the Subject of my Justice !
Good Sir , have patience ! Corv.
What couldst
thou propose
Less to thy self , than in this heat of Wrath ,
And stung with my dishonour , I should strike
This Steel into thee , with as many stabs ,
As thou wert gaz 'd upon with Goatish Eyes ?
Alas , Sir , be appeas 'd ! I could not think
My being at the Window should more , now ,
Move your impatience , than at other times .
No ?
not to seek and entertain a Parle ,
With a known Knave ?
before a Multitude ?
And point the Place , where you might meet : your Sisters ,
Your Mothers , or your Aunts might serve the turn .
Why , dear Sir , when do I make these Excuses ?
Or ever stir abroad , but to the Church ?
And that so seldom ?
Well , it shall be less ;
And thy restraint before was Liberty ,
To what I now decree : and therefore mark me .
First , I will have this bawdy Light dam 'd up ;
And till 't be done , some two or three Yards off ,
I 'll chalk a Line : o 're which , if thou but chance
To set thy desp'rate Foot ; more Hell , more Horror ,
More wild remorseless Rage shall seize on thee ,
Than on a Conjurer , that had heedless left
His circles safety ere his Devil was laid .
Then here 's a Lock , which I will hang upon thee ;
And , now I think on't , I will keep thee backwards ;
Thy Lodging shall be backward ; thy walks backwards ;
Thy Prospect-all be backwards ; and no pleasure ,
That thou shalt know but backwards : Nay , since you force
My honest nature , know , it is your own
Being too open , makes me use you thus .
Since you will not contain your subtil Nostrils
In a sweet Room , but they must snuff the Air
Of rank and sweaty Passengers ? ?
One knocks .
Away , and be not seen , pain of thy Life ;
Not look toward the Window : if thou dost ? ?
( Nay stay , hear this ) let me not prosper , Whore ,
But I will make thee an Anatomy ,
Dissect thee mine own self , and read a Lecture
Upon thee , to the City , and in publick .
Who 's there ?
' Tis Signior Mosca , Sir .
Some good , to help the bad .
My Mosca , welcom ,
I guess your news .
I fear you cannot , Sir .
Is't not his death ?
Rather the contrary .
Not his recovery ?
Yes , Sir . Corv.
I am curs 'd ,
I am bewitch 'd , my Crosses meet to vex me .
How ?
how ?
how ?
how ?
Why , Sir , with Scoto 's Oyl !
Corbaccio , and Voltore brought of it ,
VVhilst I was busie in an inner Room ? ?
Death ! that damn 'd Mountebank ! but , for the Law
Now , I could kill the Rascal : 't cannot be ,
His Oyl should have that Vertue .
Ha' not I
Known him a common Rogue , come fidling in
To th ' Osteria , with a tumbling VVhore ,
And , when he has done all his forc 'd tricks , been glad
Of a poor spoonful of dead VVine , with Flies in't ?
It cannot be .
All his Ingredients
Are a Sheeps Gall , a rosted Bitches Marrow ,
Some few sod Earwigs , pounded Caterpillers ,
Y 2 A
164 The Fox .
A little Capons Grease , and Fasting Spittle :
I know 'em to a Dram .
I know not , Sir ,
But some on't , there , they powr 'd into his Ears ,
Some in his Nostrils , and recover 'd him ;
Applying but the fricace .
Pox o ' that fricace .
And since , to seem the more officious
And flatt 'ring of his health , there , they have had
( At extream Fees ) the Colledge of Physicians
Consulting on him , how they might restore him ;
Where one would have a Cataplasm of Spices ,
Another a flayd Ape clapt to his Breast ,
A third would ha' it a Dog , a fourth an Oyl
With wild Cats Skins : at last , they all resolv 'd
That , to preserve him , was no other means ,
But some young Woman must be straight sought out ,
Lusty and full of Juice , to sleep by him ;
And , to this Service ( most unhappily ,
And most unwillingly ) am I now imploy 'd ,
Which here I thought to pre-acquaint you with ,
For your advice , since it concerns you most ,
Because , I would not do that thing might cross
Your ends , on whom I have my whole dependance , Sir :
Yet , if I do it not , they may delate
My slackness to my Patron , work me out
Of his Opinion ; and there , all your hopes ,
Ventures , or whatsoever , are all frustrate .
I do but tell you , Sir . Besides , they are all
Now striving , who shall first present him .
Therefore ?
I could intreat you , briefly , conclude somewhat :
Prevent 'em if you can .
Death to my hopes !
This is my villanous Fortune ! Best to hire
Some common Curtezan ?
I , I thought on that , Sir .
But they are all so subtil , full of Art ,
And age again doting and flexible ,
So as ? ?
I cannot tell ? ?
we may perchance
Light on a Quean , may cheat us all .
' Tis true .
No, no : it must be one , that has no tricks , Sir ,
Some simple thing , a Creature made unto it ;
Some Wench you may command .
Ha' you no Kinswoman ?
Gods so ?
Think , think , think , think , think , think , think , Sir .
One o ' the Doctors offer 'd there , his Daughter .
How ! Mos .
Yes , Signior Lupo , the Physician .
His Daughter ?
And a Virgin , Sir . Why ?
Alass ,
He knows the state of 's Body , what it is ;
That nought can warm his Blood , Sir , but a Fever ;
Nor any incantation raise his Spirit :
A long forgetfulness hath seiz 'd that part .
Besides , Sir , who shall know it ?
some one or two ?
I prythee give me leave .
If any Man
But I had had this luck ? ?
The thing in't self ,
I know , is nothing ? ?
Wherefore should not I
As well command my Blood and my Affections ,
As this dull Doctor ?
In the point of Honour ,
The Cases are all one of Wife and Daughter .
I hear him coming .
She shall do 't : ' Tis done .
Slight , if this Doctor , who is not engag 'd ,
Unless't be for his Counsel ( which is nothing )
Offer his Daughter , what should I , that am
So deeply in ?
I will prevent him , Wretch !
Covetous Wretch ! Mosca , I have determin 'd .
How , Sir ?
VVe 'll make all sure .
The
Party , you wot of ,
Shall be mine own Wife , Mosca .
Sir . The thing ,
( But that I would not seem to counsel you )
I should have motion 'd to you at the first :
And make your count , you have cut all their Throats .
Why ! 'tis directly taking a possession !
And , in his next Fit , we may let him go .
' Tis but to pull the Pillow from his Head ,
And he is thratled : 't had been done , before ,
But for your scrupulous Doubts .
I , a plague on't ,
My Conscience Fools my Wit .
Well , I 'll be brief ,
And so be thou , lest they should be before us :
Go home , prepare him , tell him , with what zeal ,
And willingness , I do it ; swear it was ,
On the first hearing ( as thou maist do , truely )
Mine own free motion .
Sir , I warrant you ,
I 'll so possess him with it , that the rest
Of his starv 'd Clients shall be banisht all ;
And only you receiv 'd .
But come not , Sir ,
Until I send , for I have something else
To ripen , for your good (you must not know't )
But do not you forget to send now .
fear not .
my Celia ?
Wife ?
what
blubbering ?
Come , dry those Tears .
I think thou thoughtest me in
earnest ?
Ha ?
by this light , I talk 'd so but to try thee .
Me-thinks , the lightness of the occasion
Should ha' confirm 'd thee .
Come , I am not jealous .
No ?
Faith , I am not , I , nor never was :
It is a poor unprofitable Humour .
Do not I know if Women have a Will ,
They 'll do 'gainst all the watches o ' the VVorld ?
And that the fiercest Spies are tam 'd with Gold ?
Tut , I am confident in thee , thou shalt see 't :
And see , I 'll give thee cause too , to believe it .
Come , kiss me .
Go , and make thee ready straight ,
In all thy best Attire , thy choicest Jewels ,
Put 'em all on , and , with 'em , thy best Looks :
VVe are invited to a solemn Feast ,
At old Volpone 's , where it shall appear
How far I'am free , from jealousie or fear .
VVith my dear self , and my most prosp'rous Parts ,
They do so spring , and burgeon ; I can feel
A whimsie i' my Blood : ( I know not how )
Success hath made me wanton .
I could skip
Out of my Skin , now , like a subtil Snake ,
I am so limber .
O ! Your Parasite
Is a most precious thing , dropt from above ,
Not bred 'mongst Clods and Clot-pouls , here on Earth .
I muse , the Mystery was not made a Science ,
It is so liberally profest ! almost
All the wise world is little else , in Nature ,
But Parasites , or Sub-parasites .
And , yet ,
I mean not those that have your bare Town-art ,
To know , who 's fit to feed 'em ; have no House ,
No Family , no Care , and therefore mould
Tales for Mens Ears , to bait that Sense ; or get
Kitchin-invention , and some stale Receipts
To please the Belly , and the Groin ; nor those ,
VVith their Court-dog-tricks , that can fawn and fleer ,
Make their Revenue out of Legs and Faces
Eccho my Lord , and lick away a Moth :
But your fine elegant Rascal , that can rise ,
And stoop ( almost together ) like an Arrow ,
Shoot through the Air as nimbly as a Star ?
Turn short , as doth a Swallow ; and be here ,
And there , and here , and yonder all at once ;
Present to any Humour , all Occasion ;
And change a Visor , swifter than a Thought !
This is the Creature had the Art born with him ;
Toils not to learn it , but doth practise it
Out of most excellent Nature : and such Sparks
Are the true Parasites , others but their Zani 's
Bonario ?
old Corbaccio 's Son ?
The Person I was bound to seek .
Fair Sir ,
You are happily met .
That cannot be by thee .
Why , Sir ?
Nay , prythee know thy way ,
and leave me :
I would be loath to interchange Discourse ,
With such a Mate as thou art .
Courteous Sir ,
Scorn not my Poverty .
Not I , by Heaven :
But thou shalt give me leave to hate thy baseness .
Baseness ?
I answer , me , is not thy sloth
Sufficient Argument ?
thy flattery ?
Thy means of feeding ?
Heaven , be good to me .
These Imputations are too common , Sir ,
And easily struck on Vertue , when she 's poor ;
You are unequal to me , and how ere
Your sentence may be righteous , yet you are not ,
That ere you know me , thus , proceed in Censure :
Mark bear witness 'gainst you , 'tis inhuman .
What ?
does he weep ?
the sign is soft , and good !
I do repent me , that I was so harsh .
' Tis true , that , sway 'd by strong necessity ,
I am enforc 'd to eat my careful Bread
With too much obsequy ; 'tis true , beside ,
That I am fain to spin mine own poor Rayment ,
Out of my meer observance , being not born
To a free Fortune : but that I have done
Base Offices , in rendring Friends asunder ,
Dividing Families , betraying Counsels ,
Whispering false Lyes , or mining Men with Praises ,
Train 'd their Credulity with Perjuries ,
Corrupted Chastity , or am in love
VVith mine own tender ease , but would not rather
Prove the most rugged , and laborious course ,
That might redeem my present estimation ;
Let me here perish , in all hope of goodness .
This cannot be a personated Passion !
I was to blame , so to mistake thy Nature ;
Prythee forgive me : and speak out thy business .
Sir , it concerns you ; and though I may seem ,
At first to make a main offence in Manners ,
And in my gratitude , unto my Master ;
Yet , for the pure love , which I bear all right ,
And hatred of the wrong , I must reveal it .
This very hour , your Father is in purpose
To disinherit you ?
How ! Mos .
And thrust you forth ,
As a meer stranger to his Blood ; 'tis true , Sir :
The work no way ingageth me , but , as
I claim an Interest in the general state
Of Goodness and true Vertue , which I hear
T' abound in you : and , for which meer respect ,
VVithout a second aim , Sir , I have done it .
This tale hath lost thee much of the late trust ,
Thou hadst with me ; it is impossible :
I know not how to lend it any thought ,
My Father should be so unnatural .
It is a confidence , that well becomes
Your Piety ; and form 'd ( no doubt ) it is
From your own simple Innocence : which makes
Your wrong more monstrous and abhor 'd .
But , Sir ,
I now will tell you more .
This very Minute ,
It is , or will be doing : And , if you
Shall be but pleas 'd to go with me , I 'll bring you ,
( I dare not say where you shall see , but ) where
Your Ear shall be a witness of the Deed ;
Hear your self written Bastard : and profest
The common Issue of the Earth .
I 'm maz 'd !
Sir , if I do it not , draw your just Sword ,
And score your vengeance , on my front and Face ;
Mark me your Villain : You have too much wrong ,
And I do suffer for you , Sir . My Heart
Weeps Blood in anguish ?
I follow thee .
Bring forth your sports
And help to make the wretched time more sweet .
Dwarf , Fool , and Eunuch , well met here we be .
A question it were not , whether of us three ,
Being all the known delicates of a rich Man ,
In pleasing him , claim the Precedency can ?
I claim for my self .
And , so doth the Fool .
' Tis foolish indeed : let me set you both to School .
First , for your Dwarf , he 's little and witty ,
And every thing , as it is little , is pritty ;
Else why do Men say to a Creature of my shape ,
So soon as they see him , it 's a pretty little Ape ?
And why a pretty Ape ?
but for pleasing imitation
Admit your Fools Face be the Mother of laughter ,
Yet , for his Brain , it must always come after :
And though that do feed him , it 's a pitiful Case ,
His Body is beholding to such a bad Face .
Who 's there ?
my Couch , away , look , Nano , see :
Give me my Caps , first ?
go , enquire .
Now , Cupid
Send it by Mosca , and with fair return .
It is the beauteous Madam ?
Would-be ?
is it ?
The same .
Now ' torment on me ; Squire her in :
For she will enter , or dwell here for ever .
Nay , quickly , that my Fit were past .
I fear
A second Hell too , that my loathing this
Will quite expel my Appetite to the other :
Would she were taking now her tedious leave .
Lord how it threats me what I am to suffer .
Unto your Patron , I am here .
This Band
Shews not my Neck enough ( I trouble you , Sir ,
Let me request you , bid one of my Women
Come hither to me ) in good faith , I am drest
Most favourably , to day ; it is no matter ,
' Tis well enough .
Look , see , these petulant things !
How they have done this ! Volp .
I do feell the Fever
Entring in at mine Ears ; O , for a Charm ,
To fright it hence .
Come nearer : is this Curl
In his right Place ?
or this ?
why is this higher
Than all the rest ?
you ha' not wash 'd your Eyes , yet ?
Or do they not stand even i' your Head ?
Where 's your fellow ?
call her .
Mark
Deliver us : anon , she 'll beat her Women ,
Because her Nose is red .
I pray you , view
This Tire , forsooth : are all things apt or no ?
One Hair a little , here , sticks out , forsooth .
Dos't so forsooth ?
and where was your dear sight
When it did so forsooth ?
what now ?
Bird-ey 'd ?
And you too ?
'pray you both approach , and mend it .
Now ( by that light ) I muse , yo 'are not asham 'd !
I , that have preach 'd these things , so oft , unto you ,
Read you the Principles , argu 'd all the Grounds ,
Disputed every fitness , every grace ,
Call 'd you to counsel of so frequent dressings ?
More carefully , than of your Fame or Honour )
Made you acquainted , what an ample Dowry
The knowledg of these things would be unto you ,
Able , alone , to get you Noble Husbands
At
166 The Fox .
At your return : and you thus to neglect it ?
Besides , you seeing what a curious Nation
Th' Italians are , what will they say of me ?
The English Lady cannot dress her self ;
Here 's a fine Imputation to our Countrey !
Well , go your ways , and stay i' the next Room .
This fucus was too course too , it 's no matter .
Good-Sir , you 'll give 'em entertainment ?
The Storm comes toward me .
How dos
my Volp ?
Troubled with noise , I cannot sleep; I dreamt
That a strange Fury entred , now , my House ,
And , with the dreadful tempest of her Breath ,
Did cleave my Roof asunder .
Believe me , and I
Had the most fearful Dream , could I remember't ?
Out on my fate ; I ha' given her the occasion
How to torment me : she will tell me hers .
Me thought , the Golden mediocrity
Polite , and delicate ?
O , if you do love me ,
No more ; I sweat , and suffer , at the mention
Of any Dream : feell how I tremble yet .
Alas , good Soul ! the Passion of the Heart .
Seed-pearl were good now , boild with Syrrup of Apples ,
Tincture of Gold , and Corral , Citron-Pills ,
Your Elicampane Root , Myrobalanes ? ?
Ay me , I have tane a Grass-hopper by the Wing .
Burnt Silk , and Amber , you have Muscadel
Good i' the House ?
You will not drink , and part ?
No, fear not that .
I doubt , we shall not get
Some English Saffron ( half a Dram would serve )
Your sixteen Cloves , a little Musk , dri 'd Mints ,
Bugloss , and Barly-meal ?
She 's in again ;
Before I fain 'd Diseases , now I have one .
And these appli 'd , with a right Scarlet-cloth ?
Another Flood of words ! a very Torrent !
Shall I , Sir , make you a Poultise ?
No, no , no ,
I 'm very well : you need prescribe no more .
I have a little studdied Physick ; but now ,
I 'm all for Musick save , i' the Forenoons ,
An hour or two for painting .
I would have
A Lady , indeed , t ' have all , Letters , and Arts ,
Be able to discourse , to write , to paint ,
But principal ( as Plato holds ) your Musick
( And so does wise Pythagoras , I take it )
Is your true Rapture ; when there is consent
In Face , in Voyce , and Clothes : and is indeed ,
Our Sexes chiefest Ornament .
The Poet ,
As old in time as Plato , and as knowing ,
Says that our highest Female grace is silence .
Which o ' your Poets ?
Petrarch ?
or Tasso ?
or Dante ?
Guerrini ?
Ariosto ?
Aretine ?
Cieco di Hadria ?
I have read them all .
Is every thing a Cause to my destruction ?
I think , I ha' two or three of 'em about me !
The Sun , the Sea will sooner both stand still ,
Than her eternal Tongue ! nothing can scape it .
Here 's Pastor Fido ?
Profess obstinate silence ;
That 's now my safest .
All our English Writers ,
I mean such as are happy in th ' Italian ,
Will deign to steal out of this Author , mainly ;
Almost as much , as from Montagnie :
He has so modern and facile a Vein ,
Fitting the time , and catching the Court-ear ;
Your Petrarch is more passionate , yet he ,
In days of sonnetting , trusting 'em , with much :
Dante is hard , and few can understand him .
But , for a desperate wit , there 's Aretine !
Only , his Pictures are a little obscene ? ?
Your mark me not ?
Alas , my Mind 's perturb 'd .
Why , in such Cases , we must cure our selves ,
Make use of our Philosophy ?
O'y me .
And , as we find our Passions do rebel ,
Encounter 'em with Reason ; or divert 'em ,
By giving scope unto some other Humour
Of lesser danger : as , in Politick Bodies ,
There 's nothing , more , doth over-whelm the Judgment ,
And clouds the Understanding , than too much
Settling , and fixing , and ( as 'twere ) subsiding
Upon one Object .
For the incorporating
Of these same outward things , into that part ,
Which we call mental , leaves some certain f?ces ,
That stop the Organs , and , as Plato says ,
Assassinates our knowledg .
Now , the Spirit
Of patience help me .
Come , in faith , I must
Visit you more adays ; and make you well :
Laugh and be lusty .
My good Angels save me .
There was but one sole Man in all the VVorld ,
VVith whom I ere could sympathise ; and he
VVould lye you often , three , four Hours together ,
To hear me speak : and be ( sometime ) so rap't ,
As he would answer me quite from the purpose ,
Like you , and you are like him , just .
I 'll discourse
( And't be but only , Sir , to bring you asleep)
How we did spend our time , and loves , together ,
For some six years .
Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
For we were co?tanei , and brought up ? ?
Some power , some fate , some Fortune rescue me .
Good Sir . Volp .
Mosca !
welcom ,
VVelcom to my redemption .
VVhy , Sir ?
Oh ,
Rid me of this my torture , quickly , there ;
My Madam , with the everlasting Voyce :
The Bells in time of Pestilence , ne 'er made
Like noise , or were in that perpetual motion !
The Cock-pit comes not neer it .
All my House ,
But now , steam 'd like a Bath , with her thick Breath .
A Lawyer could not have been heard ; nor scarce
Another VVoman , such a hail of words
She has let fall .
For Hells sake , rid her hence .
Has she presented ?
O , I do not care ,
I 'll take her absence , upon any price ,
VVith any loss .
Madam ?
I ha' brought
your Patron
A Toy , a Cap here , of mine own work ?
' Tis well ,
I had forgot to tell you , I saw your Knight ,
VVhere you 'ld little think it ? ?
VVhere ?
Marry ,
VVhere yet , if you make haste , you may apprehend him ,
Rowing upon the VVater in a gondole ,
VVith the most cunning Curtizan of Venice .
Is't true ?
Pursue 'em , and believe your Eyes :
Leave me , to make your Gift .
I knew , 't would take .
For lightly , they that use themselves most Licence ,
Are still most jealous .
Mosca , hearty thanks ,
For thy quick fiction and delivery of me .
Now , to my hopes , what sayst thou ?
But do you
hear , Sir ?
?
Again , I fear a Paroxism .
VVhich way
Row 'd they together ?
Toward the Rialto .
I pray you lend me your Dwarf .
I pray
you , take him .
Your hopes , Sir , are like happy Blossoms , fair ,
And promise timely Fruit , if you will stay
But the maturing ; keep you at your Couch ,
Corbaccio will arrive strait , with the VVill :
VVhen he is gone , I 'll tell you more .
My Blood ,
My Spirits are return 'd ; I am alive :
And like your wanton Gamester , at Primero ,
VVhose thought had whisper 'd to him , not go less .
Me thinks I lye , and draw ? ?
for an encounter .
But pray you
Have patience , Sir ; the same 's your Father , knocks :
One knocks .
I am compell 'd to leave you .
Do so .
Yet ,
Cannot my thought imagine this a Truth .
Did not I say , I would send ?
Yes , but I feard
You might forget it , and then they prevent us .
Prevent ?
did e 're Man haste so , for his Horns ?
A Courtier would not ply it so , for a place .
Well , now there 's no helping it , stay here ;
I 'll pesently return .
Where are you , Celia ?
You know not wherefore I have brought you hither ?
Not well , except you told me .
Now , I will :
Hark hither .
Sir , your Father hath sent word ,
It will be half an hour ere he come ;
And therefore , if you please to walk the while
Into that Gallery ? ?
at the upper end ,
There are some Books , to entertain the time :
And I 'll take care , no Man shall come unto you , Sir .
Yes I will stay there , I do doubt this Fellow .
There , he is far enough ; he can hear nothing :
And , for his Father , I can keep him off .
Nay , now , there is no starting back ; and therefore ,
Resolve upon it : I have so decree 'd .
It must be done .
Nor , would move 't afore ,
Because I would avoid all Shifts and Tricks ,
That might deny me , Cel .
Sir , let me beseech you ,
Affect not these strange Trials ; if you doubt
My Chastity , why lock me up , for ever :
Make me the Heir of darkness .
Let me live ,
Where I may please your fears , if not your Trust .
Believe it , I have no such Humour , I.
All that I speak , I mean ; yet I am not mad :
Not Horn-mad , see you ?
Go too , shew your self
Obedient , and a Wife .
O Heaven ! Corv.
I say it ,
Do so .
Was this the Train ?
I ' have told you
Reasons ;
What the Physicians have set down ; how much ,
It may concern me ; what my Engagements are ;
My means ; and the necessity of those means ,
For my recovery : wherefore , if you be
Loyal , and mine , be won , respect my venture .
Before your Honour ?
Honour ?
tut , a breath ;
There 's no such thing , in Nature : a meer Term
Invented to awe Fools .
What is my Gold
The worse for touching ?
Cloths for being look 'd on ?
Why , this 's no more .
An old decrepit Wretch ,
That has no Sense , no Sinew ; takes his Meat
With others Fingers ; only knows to gape ,
When you do scald his Gums ; a Voyce ; a Shadow ;
And , what can this Man hurt you ?
Lord ! what Spirit
Is this hath entred him ?
And for your fame
That 's such a Jig ; as if I would go tell it ,
Cry it on the Piazza ! who shall know it ;
But he that cannot speak it , and this Fellow ,
Whose Lips are i' my Pocket : save your self ,
If you 'll proclaim't , you may .
I know no other ,
Should come to know it .
Are Heaven , and Saints
then nothing ?
Will they be blind or stupid ?
How ?
Good Sir
Be jealous still , emulate them ; and think
What hate they burn with toward every Sin .
I grant you : if I thought it were a Sin ,
I would not urge you .
Should I offer this
To some young Frenchman , or hot Tuscan Blood ,
That had read Aretine , conn 'd all his Prints ,
Knew ever quirk within Lusts laborinth ,
And were profest Critick in Lechery ;
And I would look up on him , and applaud him ,
This were a Sin : but here , 'tis contrary ,
A pious Work , meer Charity for Physick ,
And honest Polity , to assure mine own .
O Heaven ! canst thou suffer such a change ?
Thou art mine honour Mosca , and my pride ,
My joy , my tickling , my delight ! Go , bring 'em .
Please you draw neer , Sir . Corv.
Come on , what ?
You will not be rebellious ?
by that Light ? ?
Sir , Signior Corvino , here , is come to see you .
And hearing of the consultation had ,
So lately , for your health , is come to offer ,
Or rather , Sir , to prostitute ?
Thanks , sweet Mosca .
( As the true fervent Instance of his Love )
His own most fair and proper Wife ; the Beauty ,
Only of price , in Venice ?
' Tis well urg 'd .
To be your comfortress , and to preserve you .
Alass , I am past already ! 'pray you , thank him
For his good care and promptness ; but for that ,
' Tis a vain labour e 'en to fight 'gainst Heaven ;
Applying Fire to a Stone : (uh , uh , uh , uh . )
Making a dead Leaf grow again .
I take
His wishes gently , though ; and you may tell him ,
What I ' have done for him : marry , my state is hopeless !
Will him to pray for me ; and t 'use his Fortune ,
With reverence when he comes to't .
Do you hear ,
Sir ?
Go to him , with your Wife .
Heart of my Father !
Wilt thou persist thus ?
come , I pray thee come .
Thou seest 'tis nothing , Celia .
By this hand ,
I shall grow violent .
Come , do 't , I say .
Sir , kill me , rather : I will take down Poyson ,
Eat burning Coals , do any thing ?
Be damn 'd .
( Heart ) I will drag thee hence , home , by the Hair ;
Cry thee a Strumpet through the Streets ; rip up
Thy Mouth , unto thine Ears ; and slit thy Nose ,
Like a raw Rotchet ?
do not tempt me , come .
Yield , I am loth ?
( Death ) I will buy some Slave ,
Whom I will kill , and bind thee to him , alive ;
And at my Window , hang you forth : devising
Some monstrous Crime , which I , in Capital Letters ,
Will eat into thy Flesh with Aquafortis ,
And burning Cor 'sives , on this stubborn Breast .
Now , by the Blood thou hast incens 'd , I 'll do 't .
Sir , what you please , you may , I am your Martyr .
Be not thus obstinate , I ha' not deserv 'd it :
Think who it is intreats you .
'Pr'y thee , Sweet ;
( Good faith ) thou shalt have Jewels , Gowns , Attires ,
What thou wilt think , and ask .
Do but go kiss him .
Or touch him , but .
For my sake .
And my sute .
This once .
No ?
not ?
I shall remember this .
Will you disgrace me , thus ?
do ' you thirst my undoing ?
Nay , gentle Lady , be advis 'd .
No, no .
She has watch 'd her time .
God 's precious , this is skirvy ,
' Tis very skirvy : and you are ?
Nay , good , Sir .
An errant Locust , by Heaven , a Locust .
Whore ,
Crocodile , that hast thy Tears prepar 'd ,
Expecting , how thou'ld bid 'em flow .
Nay , 'pray
you , Sir ,
She will consider .
Would my Life would serve
to satisfie .
( S 'death ) if she would but speak to him ,
And save my Reputation , 'twere somewhat ;
But , spightfully to affect my utter ruin .
I , now you ' have put your Fortune in her Hands .
Why i'faith , it is her modesty , I must quit her ;
If you were absent she would be more coming ;
I know it : and dare undertake for her .
What Woman can before her Husband ?
'pray you ,
Let
168 The Fox .
Let us depart , and leave her , here .
Sweet Celia ,
Thou mayst redeem all , yet ; I 'll say no more :
If not , esteem your self as lost .
Nay , stay there .
O God , and his good Angels ! whether , whether .
Is shame fled human Breasts ?
that with such ease ,
Men dare put off your Honours , and their own ?
Is that , which ever was a Cause of Life ,
Now plac 'd beneath the basest Circumstance ?
And modesty an exile made , for Money ?
I , in Corvino , and such Earth-fed Minds ,
That never tasted the true Heav'n of love .
Assure thee , Celia , he that would sell thee ,
Only for hope of gain , and that uncertain ,
He would have sold his part of Paradise
For ready money , had he met a Cope-man .
Why art thou maz 'd , to see me thus reviv 'd ?
Rather applaud thy Beauties Miracle ;
' Tis thy great VVork : that hath , not now alone ,
But sundry times , rais 'd me , in several shapes ,
And , but this Morning , like a Mountebank ,
To see thee at thy Window .
I , before
I would have left my practice , for thy love ,
In varying Figures , I would have contented
With the blue Proteus , or the horned Flood .
Now art thou welcom .
Sir ! Volp .
Nay , fly me not .
Nor , let thy false imagination
That I was Bed-rid , make thee think , I am so :
Thou shalt not find it .
I am , now , as fresh ,
As hot , as high , and in as jovial plight ,
I acted young Antinous ; and attracted
The Eyes and Ears of all the Ladies , present ,
T' admire each graceful Gesture , Note , and Footing .
S O N G.
COme , my Celia , let us prove ,
While we can , the sports of Love ;
Time will not be ours for ever ,
He , at length , our good will sever ;
Spend not then his Gifts in vain .
Suns , that set , may rise again :
But if once we lose this light ,
' Tis with us perpetual night .
Why should we defer our Joys ?
Fame and Rumour are but Toys .
Cannot we delude the Eyes
Of a few poor Houshold spies ?
Or his easier Ears beguile ,
Thus removed by our wile ?
' Tis no Sin Loves Fruits to steal ;
But the sweet thefts to reveal :
To be taken , to be seen ,
These have Crimes accounted been .
Some Serene blast me , or dire Lightning strike
This my offending Face .
VVhy droops my Celia ?
Thou hast in place of a base Husband , found
A worthy Lover : use thy Fortune well ,
VVith secrecy and pleasure .
See , behold ,
VVhat thou are Queen of ; not in expectation ,
As I feed others : but posses 'd and crown 'd .
See , here , a Rope of Pearl ; and each , more Orient
Than that the brave ?gyptian Queen carrous 'd :
Dissolve and drink 'em .
See , a Carbuncle ,
May put out both the Eyes of our St .
Mark ;
A Diamond would have brought Laullia Paulina ,
VVhen she came in like Star-light hid with Jewels ,
That were the Spoyls of Provinces ; take these ,
And wear , and lose 'em : yet remains an Ear-ring
To purchase them again , and this whole state .
A Gem but worth a private Patrimony ,
Is nothing : we will eat such at a Meal .
The Heads of Parrots , Tongues of Nightingales ,
The Brains of Peacocks , and of Estriches
Shall be our Food : and , could we get the Ph ?nix ,
( Though Nature lost her kind ) she were our Dish .
Good Sir , these things might move a Mind affected
VVith such delights ; but I , whose Innocence
Is all I can think wealthy , or worth th ' enjoying ,
And which once lost , I have nought to lose beyond it ,
Cannot be taken with these sensual Baits :
If you have Conscience ?
' Tis the Beggers Vertue ,
If thou hast VVisdom , hear me , Celia .
Thy Bathes shall be the Juice of July-flowers ,
Spirit of Roses , and of Violets ,
The Milk of Unicorns , and Panthers breath
Gather 'd in Bags , and mixt with Cretan VVines .
Our drink shall be prepared Gold and Amber ;
VVhich we will take , until my Roof whirl round
VVith the Vertigo : and my Dwarf shall dance ,
My Eunuch sing , my Fool make up the Antick ,
VVhilst we , in changed shapes , act Ovids Tales ,
Thou , like Europa now , and I like Jove ,
Then I like Mars , and thou like Erycine :
So , of the rest , till we have quite run through ,
And wearied all the Fables of the Gods .
Then will I have thee in more modern Forms ,
Attired like some sprightly Dame of France ,
Brave Tuscan Lady , or proud Spanish Beauty ;
Sometimes , unto the Persian Sophies VVife ;
Or the Grand Signiors Mistress ; and , for change ,
To one of our most artful Courtizans ,
Or some quick Negro , or cold Russian ;
And I will meet thee in as many shapes :
VVhere we may so transfuse our wandring Souls :
Out at our Lips , and score up sums of Pleasures ,
That the curious shall not know
How to tell them , as they flow ;
And the envious , when they find
What their number is , be pind .
If you have Ears that will be pierc 'd ; or Eyes ,
That can be open 'd ; a Heart may be touch 'd ;
Or any part , that yet sounds Man about you :
If you have touch of Holy Saints , or Heaven ,
Do me the Grace to let me scape .
If not ,
Be bountiful and kill me .
You do know ,
I am a Creature , hither ill betray 'd ,
By one , whose shame I would forget it were ;
If you will deign me neither of these Graces ,
Yet feed your VVrath , Sir , rather than your Lust ;
( It is a Vice comes nearer manliness )
And punish that unhappy Crime of Nature ,
VVhich you mis-cal my Beauty : flay my Face ,
Or Poyson it , with Oyntments , for seducing
Your Blood to this Rebellion .
Rub these Hands ,
VVith what may cause an eating Leprosie ,
E'en to my Bones and Marrow : any thing ,
That may disfavour me , save in my Honour .
And I will kneel to you , pray for you , pay down
A thousand hourly Vows , Sir , for your health ,
Report and think you vertuous ?
Think me cold ,
Frozen and impotent , and so report me ?
That I had Nestor 's Hernia , thou wouldst think .
I do degenerate , and abuse my Nation ,
To play with Opportunity thus long :
I should have done the act , and then have parlee 'd ,
Yield , or I 'll force thee .
O ! just God .
In vain ?
Forbear , foul Ravisher , libidinous Swine ,
Free the forc 'd Lady , or thou dy 'st , Impostor .
But that I am loth to snatch the Punishment
Out of the hand of Justice , thou shouldst , yet ,
Be made the timely Sacrifice of Vengeance ,
Before
The Fox .
169
Before this Altar , and this Dross , thy Idol .
Lady , let 's quit the Place , it is the Den
Of Villany ; fear nought , you have a Guard :
And he , e 're long , shall meet his just Reward .
Fall on me , Roof , and bury me in Ruine ;
Become my Grave , that wert my Shelter .
O !
I am unmask 'd , unspirited , undone ,
Betray 'd to Beggery , to Infamy ? ? ?
To beat out my unlucky Brains .
Here , here .
What ! dost thou bleed ?
O that his well-driv'n Sword
Had been so covetous to have cleft me down
Unto the Navel , ere I liv 'd to see
My Life , my Hopes , my Spirits , my Patron , all
Thus desperately engaged , by my Error .
Wo on thy Fortune .
And my Follies , Sir .
Th' hast made me miserable .
And my self , Sir .
Who would have thought he would have hearkned so ?
What shall we do ?
I know not ; if my Heart
Could expiate the Mischance , I'ld pluck it out .
Will you be pleas 'd to hang me , or cut my Throat ?
And I 'll requite you , Sir . Let 's die like Romans ,
Since we have liv 'd like Grecians .
Hark , who 's there ?
I hear some Footing ; Officers , the Saffi ,
Come to apprehend us ; I do feel the Brand
Hissing already at my Forehead ; now
Mine Ears are boring .
To your Couch , Sir , you
Make that Place good however .
Guilty Men
Suspect what they deserve still .
Signior Corbaccio!
O , undone , amaz 'd , Sir !
Your Son ( I know not by what Accident )
Acquainted with your Purpose to my Patron ,
Touching your Will , and making him your Heir ,
Entred our House with violence , his Sword drawn ,
Sought for you , call 'd you Wretch , unnatural ,
Vow 'd he would kill you .
Me ?
Yes , and my Patron .
My Life , Sir ,
Is not more tender 'd .
I am only yours .
How does he ?
will he die shortly , think 'st thou ?
I fear , he 'll out-last May .
To day ?
No, last out May , Sir .
Could 'st thou not gi' him a Dram ?
O , by no means , Sir .
Nay , I 'll not bid you .
This is a Knave , I see .
How , Signior Voltore ! Did he hear me ?
Who 's that ?
O , Sir , most timely welcome ?
Scarce , to the discovery of your Tricks , I fear .
You are his only ?
and mine also ?
are you not ?
Who ?
I , Sir ! Volt .
You , Sir . What Device is this
About a Will ?
A Plot for you , Sir . Volt .
Come ,
Put not your Foists upon me , I shall scent 'em .
Did you not hear it ?
Yes , I hear , Corbaccio
Hath made your Patron there his Heir .
' Tis true ,
By my Device , drawn to it by my Plot ,
With hope ?
Your Patron should reciprocate ?
And you have promis 'd ?
For your good , I did , Sir .
Nay more , I told his Son , brought , hid him here ,
Where he might hear his Father pass the Deed ;
Being perswaded to it by this Thought , Sir ,
To do some Violence upon his Parent ,
On which the Law should take sufficient hold ,
And you be stated in a double Hope :
Truth be my Comfort , and my Conscience ,
My only Aim was to dig you a Fortune
Out of these two old rotten Sepulchers ?
I cry thee mercy , Mosca . )
Worth your Patience ,
And your great Merit , Sir . And see the Change !
Why , what Success ?
Most hapless ! You must help , Sir .
Whilst we expected th ' old Raven , in comes
Corvino 's Wife , sent hither by her Husband ?
VVhat , with a Present ?
No, Sir , on Visitation :
( I 'll tell you how anon ) and staying long ,
The Youth he grows impatient , rushes forth ,
Seizeth the Lady , wounds me , makes her swear
( Or he would murder her , that was his Vow )
T' affirm my Patron to have done her Rape :
VVhich how unlike it is , you see ; and hence
VVith that Pretext he 's gone t ' accuse his Father ,
Defame my Patron , defeat you ? ?
VVhere 's her Husband ?
Let him be sent for streight .
Sir , I 'll go fetch him .
Bring him to the Scrutineo .
Sir , I will .
This must be stopt .
O , you do nobly , Sir .
Alas , 'twas labour 'd all , Sir , for your good ;
Nor was there wont of Counsel in the Plot :
But Fortune can , at any time o 'erthrow
The Projects of a hundred Learned Clerks , Sir .
VVhat 's that ?
VVill 't please you , Sir , to go along ?
Patron , go in , and pray for our Success .
Need makes Devotion : Heaven your Labour bless .
What Observation is .
You mention 'd me
For some Instructions : I will tell you , Sir ,
( Since we are met here in this Height of Venice )
Some few Particulars , I have set down ,
Only for this Meridian , fit to be known
Of your crude Traveller ; and they are these .
I will not touch , Sir , at your Phrase , or Clothes ,
For they are old .
Sir , I have better .
Pardon ,
I meant , as they are Themes .
O , Sir , proceed :
I 'll slander you no more of Wit , good Sir .
First , for your Garb , it must be grave and serious ;
Very reserv 'd and lockt ; not tell a Secret
On any terms , not to your Father ; scarce
A Fable , but with caution : Make sure choice
Both of your Company , and Discourse ; beware
You never speak a truth ?
Not to strangers ,
For those be they you must converse with most :
Others I would not know , Sir , but at distance ,
So as I still might be a Saver in 'em :
You shall have Tricks else past upon you hourly .
And then , for your Religion , profess none ,
But wonder at the diversity of all ;
And , for your part , protest , were there no other
But simply the Laws o ' th ' Land , you could content you .
Machiavel , and Monsieur Bodine , both
Were of this mind .
Then must you learn the Use
And handling of your Silver Fork at Meals ,
The Metal of your Glass : ( these are main Matters
Z With
170 The Fox .
With your Italian ) and to know the Hour
When you must eat your Melons and your Figs .
Is that a Point of State too ?
Here it is :
For your Venetian , if he see a Man
Preposterous in the least , he has him strait ;
He has ; he strips him .
I 'll acquaint you , Sir ,
I now have liv 'd here ( 'tis some fourteen Months : )
Within the first Week of my Landing here ,
All took me for a Citizen of Venice ,
I knew the Forms so well ?
And nothing else .
I had read Contarene , took me a House ,
Dealt with my Jews to furnish it with Movables ?
VVell , if I could but find one Man , one Man
To mine own Heart , whom I durst trust , I would ?
VVhat ?
what , Sir ?
Make him rich ; make him a Fortune :
He should not think again .
I would command it .
As how ?
VVith certain Projects that I have ,
VVhich I may not discover .
If I had
But one to wager with , I would lay Odds now ,
He tells me instantly .
One is , ( and that
I care not greatly who knows ) to serve the State
Of Venice with Red Herrings for three Years ,
And at a certain Rate , from Rotterdam ,
VVhere I have Correspondence .
There 's a Letter ,
Sent me from one o ' th ' States , and to that purpose ;
He cannot write his Name , but that 's his Mark .
He is a Chandler .
No, a Cheesmonger .
There are some others too , with whom I treat
About the same Negotiation ;
And I will undertake it : For , 'tis thus ,
I 'll do 't with ease , I have cast it all : Your Hoy
Carries but three Men in her , and a Boy ;
And she shall make me three Returns a Year :
So if there come but one of three , I save ;
If two , I can defalk : But this is now ,
If my main Project fail .
Then you have others ?
I should be loth to draw the subtil Air
Of such a Place , without my thousand Aims .
I 'll not dissemble , Sir ; where ere I come ,
I love to be considerative ; and , 'tis true ,
I have at my free Hours thought upon
Some certain Goods unto the State of Venice ,
VVhich I do call my Cautions ; and , Sir , which
I mean ( in hope of Pension ) to propound
To the Great Counsel , then unto the Forty ,
So to the Ten .
My Means are made already ? ?
By whom ?
Sir , that though his Place b' obscure ,
Yet he can sway , and they will hear him .
He 's
A Commandadore .
What a common Serjeant ?
Sir , such as they are , put it in their Mouths ,
What they should say , sometimes , as well as greater .
I think I have my Notes to shew you ?
Good Sir .
But you shall swear unto me , on your Gentry ,
Not to anticipate ?
I , Sir ?
Nor reveal
A Circumstance ?
My Paper is not with me .
O , but you can remember , Sir . Pol .
My first is
Concerning Tinder-boxes .
You must know ,
No Family is here without its Box .
Now , Sir , it being so portable a thing ,
Put case , that you or I were ill affected
Unto the State , Sir , with it in our Pockets ,
Might not I go into the Arsenal ,
Or you , come out again , and none the wiser ?
Except your self , Sir . Pol .
Go to then .
I therefore
Advertise to the State , how fit it were ,
That none but such as were known Patriots ,
Sound Lovers of their Country , should be suffer 'd
T' enjoy them in their Houses ; and even those
Seal 'd at some Office , and at such a bigness
As might not lurk in Pockets .
Admirable !
My next is , how t ' enquire , and be resolv 'd ,
By present Demonstration , whether a Ship ,
Newly arriv 'd from Soria , or from
Any suspected Part of all the Levant ,
Be guilty of the Plague : And where they use
To lie out forty , fifty days sometimes ,
About the Lazaretto , for their Trial ,
I 'll save that Charge and Loss unto the Merchant ,
And in an Hour clear the Doubt .
Indeed , Sir ?
Or ?
I will lose my Labour .
' My faith , that 's much .
Nay , Sir , conceive me .
' Twill cost me , in Onions ,
Some thirty Livres ?
Which is one Pound Sterling .
Beside my Water-works : For this I do , Sir .
First , I bring in your Ship 'twixt two Brick-walls ;
( But those the State shall venture ) on the one
I strain me a fair Tarpaulin , and in that
I stick my Onions , cut in halfs ; the other
Is full of Loop-holes , out at which I thrust
The Noses of my Bellows ; and those Bellows
I keep , with Water-works , in perpetual Motion ,
( Which is the easiest matter of a hundred . )
Now , Sir , your Onion , which doth naturally
Attract th ' Infection , and your Bellows blowing
The Air upon him , will shew ( instantly )
By his chang 'd Colour , if there be Contagion ,
Or else remain as fair as at the first .
Now 'tis known , 'tis nothing .
You are right , Sir .
I would I had my Note .
' Faith , so would I :
But you ha' done well for once , Sir . Pol .
Were I false ,
Or would be made so , I could shew you Reasons
How I could sell this State now to the Turk ,
Spite of their Gallies , or their ?
Pray you , Sir Pol .
I have 'em not about me .
That I fear 'd .
They are there , Sir . Pol .
No, this is my Diary ,
I put on new , and did go forth : but first
I threw three Beans over the Threshold .
Item ,
I went and bought two Tooth-picks , whereof one
I burst immediately , in a Discourse
With a Dutch Merchant , 'bout Ragion del Stato .
From him I went , and paid a Moccinigo
For piecing my Silk Stockins ; by the way
I cheapned Sprats ; and at St .
Mark 's I urin 'd .
' Faith , these are Politick Notes ! Pol .
Sir , I do slip
Sure he 's
Why , then he 's fast .
I , he plays both with me .
I pray you stay .
This Heat will do more harm
To my Complexion , than his Heart is worth .
( I do not care to hinder , but to take him . )
How it comes off ! Wom .
My Master 's yonder .
Where ?
With a young Gentleman .
That same 's the Party !
In Man 's Apparel .
'Pray you , Sir , jog my Knight :
I will be tender to his Reputation ,
However he demerit .
My Lady ! Per .
Where ?
' Tis she indeed , Sir ; you shall know her .
She is ,
Were she not mine , a Lady of that merit ,
For Fashion and Behaviour ; and for Beauty
I durst compare ?
It seems you are not jealous ,
That dare commend her .
Nay , and for Diseourse ?
Being your Wife , she cannot miss that .
Madam ,
Here is a Gentleman , 'pray you use him fairly ;
He seems a Youth , but he is ?
Yes , one
Has put his Face as soon into the World ?
You
The Fox .
171
You mean , as early ?
but to day ?
How 's this !
Why in this Habit , Sir , you apprehend me .
Well , Master Would-be , this doth not become you ;
I had thought , the Odour , Sir , of your good Name
Had been more precious to you ; that you would not
Have done this dire Massacre on your Honour ;
One of your Gravity , and Rank besides !
But Knights , I see , care little for the Oath
They make to Ladies ; chiefly , their own Ladies .
Now , by my Spurs , ( the symbol of my Knighthood )
Lord , how his Brain is humbled for an Oath ! )
I reach you not .
Right , Sir , your Politie
May bear it through thus .
Sir , a Word with you .
I would be loth to contest publickly
With any Gentlewoman , or to seem
Froward , or violent , ( as the Courtier says )
It comes too near Rusticity in a Lady ,
Which I would shun by all means ; and however
I may deserve from Master Would-be , yet
T' have one fair Gentlewoman thus be made
Th' unkind Instrument to wrong another ,
And one she knows not , I , and to persevere ;
In my poor Judgment , is not warranted
From being a Sol?cism
in our Sex ,
If not in Manners .
How is this ! Pol .
Sweet Madam ,
Come nearer to your Aim .
Marry , and I will , Sir .
Since you provoke me with your Impudence ,
And Laughter of your Land-Syren here ,
Your Sporus , your Hermaphrodite ?
What 's here ?
Poetick Fury , and Historick Storms !
The Gentleman , believe it , is of worth ,
And of our Nation .
I , your White-Friars Nation ?
Come , I blush for you , Master Would-be , I ;
And am asham 'd you should ha' no more Forehead ,
Than thus to be the Patron , or St .
George ,
To a lewd Harlot , a base Fricatrice ,
A Female Devil , in a Male Out-side .
Nay ,
And you be such a one , I must bid Adieu
To your Delights .
The Case appears too liquid .
I , you may carry 't clear , with your State-face !
But for your Carnival Concupiscence ,
Who here is fled for Liberty of Conscience ,
From furious Persecution of the Marshal ,
Her will I disc'ple .
This is fine , i' faith !
And do you use this often ?
Is this part
Of your Wits Exercise , 'gainst you have occasion ?
Madam ?
Go to , Sir .
Do you hear me , Lady ?
Why , if your Knight have set you to beg Shirts ,
Or to invite me home , you might have done it
A nearer way by far .
This cannot work you
Out of my Snare .
Why ?
am I in it , then ?
Indeed your Husband told me you were Fair ,
And so you are ; only your Nose enclines
( That Side that 's next the Sun ) to the Queen-apple .
This cannot be endur 'd , by any Patience .
If the Senate
Right not my quest in this , I will protest 'em ,
To all the World , no Aristocracy .
What is the Injury , Lady ?
Why , the Callet
You told me of , here I have tane disguis 'd .
Who ?
this ?
what means your Ladiship ?
the Creature
I mention 'd to you , is apprehended , now ,
Before the Senate ; you shall see her ?
Where ?
I 'll bring you to her .
This young Gentleman ,
I saw him land this Morning at the Port .
Is't possible ! how was my Judgment wander 'd !
Sir , I must , blushing , say to you , I have err 'd ;
And plead your Pardon ?
What , more Changes yet ?
I hope yo ' ha' not the malice to remember
A Gentlewomans Passion .
If you stay
In Venice here , please you to use me , Sir ?
Will you go , Madam ?
'Pray you , Sir , use me : In faith .
The more you see me , the more I shall conceive
You have forgot our Quarrel .
This is rare !
Sir Politick Would-be ?
No, Sir Politick Bawd !
To bring me thus acquainted with his Wife !
Well , wise Sir Pol , since you have practis 'd thus
Upon my Freshman-ship , I 'll try your Salt-head ,
What Proof it is against a Counter-plot .
Your Constancy is all that is requir 'd
Unto the Safety of it .
Is the Lie
Safely convey 'd amongst us ?
is that sure ?
Knows every Man his Burden ?
Then shrink not .
But know the Advocate the Truth ?
O , Sir ,
By no means .
I devis 'd a formal Tale ,
That salv 'd your Reputation .
But be valiant , Sir .
I fear no one but him , that this his Pleading ,
Should make him stand for a Co-heir ?
Co-halter !
Hang him , we will but use his Tongue , his Noise ,
As we do Croakers here .
I , what shall he do ?
When we ha' done , you mean ?
Why , we 'll think :
Sell him for Mummia , he 's half Dust already .
Do you not smile , to see this Buffalo
How he doth sport it with his Head ?
?
I should
If all were well , and past .
Sir , only you
Are he that shall enjoy the Crop of all ,
And these not know for whom they toil .
I peace .
But you shall eat it .
Much Worshipful Sir ,
Mercury sit upon your thundring Tongue ,
Or the French Hercules , and make your Language
As conquering as his Club , to beat along
( As with a Tempest ) flat , our Adversaries ;
But much more yours , Sir . Volt .
Here they come , ha' done .
I have another Witness , if you need , Sir ,
I can produce .
Who is it ?
Sir , I have her .
THe like of this the Senate never heard of .
' Twill come most strange to them , when
we report it .
The Gentlewoman has been ever held
Of unreproved Name .
So the young Man .
The more unnatural part that of his Father .
More of the Husband .
I not know to give
And all after-times !
I never heard a true Voluptuary
Describ 'd , but him .
Appear yet those were cited ?
Why is not he here ?
Please your Fatherhoods ,
Here is his Advocate : Himself 's so weak ,
So feeble ?
What are you ?
His Parasite ,
His Knave , his Pandar : I beseech the Court ,
He may be forc 'd to come , that your grave Eyes
May bear strong Witness of his strange Impostures .
Z 2 Volt .
Upon
172 The Fox .
Upon my Faith and Credit , with your Vertues ,
He is not able to endure the Air .
Bring him , however .
We will see him .
Fetch him .
Your Fatherhoods fit Pleasures be obey 'd ;
But sure , the Sight will rather move your Pities ,
Than Indignation : May it please the Court ,
In the mean time , he may be heard in me .
I know this Place most void of Prejudice ,
And therefore crave it , since we have no reason
To fear our Truth should hurt our Cause .
Speak free .
Then know , most honoured Fathers , I must now
Discover to your strangely ' abused Ears
The most prodigious and most frontless Piece
Of solid Impudence , and Treachery ,
That ever vicious Nature yet brought forth
To shame the State of Venice .
This lewd Woman
( That wants no artificial Looks , or Tears ,
To help the Vizor she has now put on )
Hath long been known a close Adulteress
To that lascivious Youth there ; not suspected ,
Stand here , the most unhappy , innocent Person
That ever Man 's own Goodness made accus 'd .
For these , not knowing how to owe a Gift
Of that dear Grace , but with their Shame ; being plac 'd
So ' above all Powers of their Gratitude ,
Began to hate the Benefit ; and , in place
Of Thanks , devise t ' extirp the Memory
Such take , even from their Crimes .
But that anon
Will more appear .
This Gentleman , the Father ,
Hearing of this foul Fact , with many others ,
Which daily struck at his too tender Ears ,
And griev 'd in nothing more than that he could not
Preserve himself a Parent , ( his Son 's Ills
Growing to that strange Flood ) at last decree 'd
To disinherit him .
These be strange Turns !
The young Mans Fame was ever fair and honest .
So much more full of danger is his Vice ,
That can beguile so , under shade of Vertue .
But , as I said , ( my honour 'd Sires ) his Father
Having this setled Purpose , ( by what means
To him betray 'd , we know not ) and this day
Appointed for the Deed ; that Parricide .
( I cannot stile him better ) by Confederacy
Preparing this his Paramour to be there ,
Entred Volpone 's House , ( who was the Man ,
Your Fatherhoods must understand , design 'd
For the Inheritance ) there , sought his Father :
But with what purpose sought he him , my Lords ?
( I tremble to pronounce it , that a Son
Unto a Father , and to such a Father ,
Should have so foul , felonious intent )
It was to murder him : When , being prevented
By his more happy Absence , what then did he ?
Not check his wicked Thoughts ; no , now new Deeds ;
( Mischief doth ever end where it begins )
Naked , upon the Floor , there left him ; wounded
His Servant in the Face , and , with this Strumpet ,
The Stale to his forg 'd Practice , who was glad
To be so active , ( I shall here desire
Your Fatherhoods to note but my Collections ,
As most remarkable ) thought at once to stop
His Father 's Ends , discredit his Free Choice
In the old Gentleman , redeem themselves ,
By laying Infamy upon this Man ,
To whom , with blushing , they should owe their Lives .
What Proofs have you of this ?
Most honour 'd Fathers ,
I humbly crave , there be no credit given
To this Man 's mercenary Tongue .
His Soul moves in his Fee .
O , Sir . Bon .
This Fellow ,
For six Souz more , would plead against his Maker .
You do forget your self .
Nay , nay , Grave Fathers ,
Let him have scope : Can any Man imagine
That he will spare his Accuser , that would not
Have spar 'd his Parent ?
Well , produce your Proofs .
I would I could forget I were a Creature .
Signior Corbaccio .
What is he ?
The Father .
Has he had an Oath ?
What must I do now ?
Your Testimony 's crav 'd .
Speak to the Knave ?
I 'll ha' my Mouth first stopt with Earth ; my Heart
Abhors his Knowledge : I disclaim in him .
But for what Cause ?
The meer Portent of Nature :
He is an utter Stranger to my Loins .
Have they made you to this !
I will not hear thee ,
Monster of Men , Swine , Goat , Wolf , Parricide ,
Speak not , thou Viper .
Sir , I will sit down ,
And rather wish my Innocence should suffer ,
Than I resist the Authority of a Father .
Signior Corvino .
This is strange ! Avoc.
Who 's this ?
The Husband .
Is he sworn ?
He is .
Speak then .
This woman ( please your Fatherhoods ) is a whore ,
Of most hot Exercise , more than a Partrich ,
Upon Record ?
No more .
Neighs like a Jennet .
Preserve the Honour of the Court .
I shall ,
And Modesty of your most reverend Ears .
And yet I hope that I may say , these Eyes
Have seen her glew 'd unto that piece of Cedar ,
That fine well-timber 'd Gallant ; and that here
The Letters may be read , thorow the Horn ,
That make the Story perfect .
Excellent ! Sir .
There is no Shame in this now , is there ?
Or if I said , I hop 'd that she were onward
To her Damnation , if there be a Hell
Greater than Whore , and Woman ; a good Catholick
May make the doubt .
His Grief hath made him frantick .
Remove him hence .
Look to the Woman .
Rare ! Prettily feign 'd ! again !
Stand from about her .
Give her the Air .
What can you say ?
My Wound
( May 't please your Wisdoms ) speaks for me , receiv 'd
In aid of my good Patron , when he mist
His sought-for Father , when that well-taught Dame
Had her Cue given her , to cry out , A Rape .
O , most laid Impudence ! Fathers ?
Sir , be silent ;
You had your Hearing free , so must they theirs .
I do begin to doubt th ' Imposture here .
This Woman has too many Moods .
Grave Fathers ,
She is a Creature of a most profest
And prostituted Lewdness .
Most impetuous !
Unsatisfied , Grave Fathers ! Volt .
May her Feignings
Not
The Fox .
173
Not take your Wisdoms : But this day she baited
A Stranger , a grave Knight , with her loose Eyes ,
And more lascivious Kisses .
This Man saw 'em
Together on the Water , in a Gondola .
Here is the Lady her self , that saw 'em too ,
Without ; who then had in the open Streets
Pursu 'd them , but for saving her Knight 's Honour .
Produce that Lady .
Let her come .
These things ,
They strike with wonder .
I am turn 'd a Stone .
I , this same is she .
Out , thou Chamelion Harlot ; now thine Eyes
Vie Tears with the Hy?na : Dar 'st thou look
Upon my wronged Face ?
I cry your Pardons ,
I fear I have ( forgettingly ) transgrest
Against the Dignity of the Court ?
No, Madam
And been exorbitant ?
You have not , Lady .
These Proofs are strong .
Surely , I had no purpose
To scandalize your Honours , or my Sexes .
We do believe it .
Surely , you may believe it .
Madam , we do .
Indeed you may ; my Breeding
Is not so course ?
We know it .
To offend
With Pertinacy ?
Such a Presence !
No, surely .
We well think it .
You may think it .
Let her o 'recome .
What Witnesses have you ,
To make good your Report ?
Our Consciences .
And Heaven , that never fails the Innocent .
These are no Testimonies .
Not in your Courts ,
Where Multitude and Clamour overcomes .
Nay , then you do wax insolent .
Here , here ,
The Testimony comes , that will convince ,
And put to utter dumbness their bold Tongues .
See here , Grave Fathers , here 's the Ravisher ,
The Rider on Mens Wives , the great Impostor ,
The grand Voluptuary ! Do you not think
These Limbs should affect Venery ?
or these Eyes
Covet a Concubine ?
Pray you mark these Hands :
Are they not fit to stroke a Ladies Breasts ?
Perhaps he doth dissemble ?
So he does .
Would you ha' him tortur 'd ?
I would have him prov 'd .
Best try him then with Goads , or burning Irons ;
Put him to the Strappado : I have heard
The Rack hath cur 'd the Gout ; faith , give it him ,
And help him of a Malady , be courteous .
I 'll undertake , before these honour 'd Fathers ,
He shall have yet as many left Diseases ,
As she has known Adulteries , or thou Strumpets .
O , my most equal Hearers , if these Deeds ,
To him that dares traduce him ?
Which of you
Are safe , my honour 'd Fathers ?
I would ask
( With leave of your grave Fatherhoods ) if their Plot
Have any Face or Colour like to Truth ?
Or if , unto the dullest Nostril here ,
It smell not rank , and most abhorred Slander ?
I crave your Care of this good Gentleman ,
Whose Life is much endanger 'd by their Fable ;
And as for them , I will conclude with this ,
That vicious Persons , when they 're hot and flesh 'd
Take 'em to Custody , and sever them .
' Tis pity two such Prodigies should live .
Let the old Gentleman be return 'd with care :
I 'm sorry our Credulity wrong 'd him .
These are two Creatures !
I have an Earthquake in me .
Their shame ( even in their Cradles ) fled their
You 've done a worthy Service to the State , Sir ,
In their discovery .
You shall hear , ere night ,
What Punishment the Court decrees upon 'em .
We thank your Fatherhoods .
How like you it ?
I'ld ha' your Tongue , Sir , tipt with Gold for this ;
I'ld ha' you be the Heir to the whole City ;
The Earth I'ld have want Men , ere you want Living :
They 're bound to erect your Statue in St .
Signior Corvino , I would have you go
And shew your self , that you have conquer 'd .
It was much better that you should profess
Your self a Cuckold thus , than that the other
Should have been prov 'd .
Nay , I consider 'd that :
Now it is her fault .
Then it had been yours .
True , I do doubt this Advocate still .
I'faith
You need not , I dare ease you of that Care .
I trust thee , Mosca .
As your own Soul , Sir . Corb .
Now for your Business , Sir .
How ?
ha' you Business ?
Yes , yours , Sir . Corb .
O , none else ?
None else , not I.
Be careful then .
Rest you with both your Eyes , Sir .
Dispatch it .
And look that all ,
Whatever , be put in , Jewels , Plate , Moneys ,
Houshold-stuff , Bedding , Curtains .
Curtain-rings , Sir .
Only the Advocate 's Fee must be deducted .
I 'll pay him now ; you 'll be too prodigal .
Sir , I must tender it .
Two Cecchines is well .
No, Six , Sir . Corb .
' Tis too much .
He talk 'd a great while ;
You must consider that , Sir . Corb .
Well , there 's Three ?
I 'll give it him .
Do so , and there 's for thee .
Bountiful Bones ! What horrid strange Offence
Did he commit 'gainst Nature , in his Youth ,
Worthy this Age ?
You see , Sir , how I work
Unto your Ends : take you no notice .
No,
I 'll leave you .
All is yours , the Devil and all :
Good Advocate .
Madam , I 'll bring you home .
No, I 'll go see your Patron .
That you shall not :
I 'll tell you why .
My purpose is to urge
My Patron to reform his Will ; and for
The Zeal you have shewn to day , whereas before
You were but third or fourth , you shall be now
Put in the first ; which would appear as begg 'd ,
If you were present .
Therefore ?
You shall sway me .
I ne 'er was in dislike with my Disguise
Till this fled Moment ; here 'twas good , in private ;
But in your publick , Cave whilst I breathe .
' Fore God , my left Leg 'gan to have the Cramp ,
And I apprehended strait some Power had struck me
With a Dead Palsie : Well , I must be merry ,
And shake it off .
A many of these Fears
Would
174 The Fox .
Would put me into some villanous Disease ,
Should they come thick upon me : I 'll prevent 'em .
Give me a Bowl of lusty Wine , to fright
This humour from my heart , ( hum , hum , hum . )
' Tis almost gone already : I shall conquer .
Any Device now , of rare ingenious Knavery ,
That would possess me with a violent Laughter ,
Would make me up again .
So , so , so , so .
This Heat is Life ; 'tis Blood by this time : Mosca !
Does the Day look clear again ?
Are we recover 'd , and wrought out of Error ,
Into our Way , to see our Path before us ?
Is our Trade free once more ?
Exquisite Mosca !
Was it not carried learnedly ?
And stoutly .
Good Wits are greatest in Extremities .
It were a Folly , beyond thought , to trust
O , more than if I had enjoy 'd the Wench :
The Pleasure of all Woman-kind 's not like it .
Why now you speak , Sir . We must here be fixt ;
Here we must rest ; this is our Master-piece :
We cannot think to go beyond this .
True ,
Thou hast plaid thy Prize , my precious Mosca .
Nay , Sir ,
To gull the Court ?
And quite divert the Torrent
Upon the Innocent .
Yes , and to make
So rare a Musick out of Discords ?
That yet to me 's the strangest ! how th ' hast born it !
That these ( being so divided 'mongst themselves )
Should not scent somewhat , or in me , or thee ,
Or doubt their own Side .
True , they will not see 't .
Too much Light blinds 'em , I think .
Each of 'em
Is so possest and stufft with his own Hopes ,
That any thing unto the contrary ,
Never so true , or never so apparent ,
Never so palpable , they will resist it ?
Like a Temptation of the Devil .
Right , Sir .
Merchants may talk of Trade , and your great Signiors
Of Land that yields well ; but if Italy
Have any Glebe more fruitful than these Fellows ,
I am deceiv 'd .
Did not your Advocate rare ?
O ( My most honour 'd Fathers , my grave Fathers ,
Under correction of your Fatherhoods ,
What Face of Truth is here ?
If these strange Deeds
May pass , most honour 'd Fathers ?
) I had much ado
To forbear laughing .
' T seem 'd to me , you sweat , Sir .
In troth , I did a little .
But confess , Sir ,
Were you not daunted ?
In good faith , I was
A little in a Mist , but not dejected ;
Never but still my self .
I think it , Sir .
Now ( so Truth help me ) I must needs say this , Sir ,
And out of Conscience , for your Advocate ,
He has taken pains , in faith , Sir , and deserv 'd
( In my poor Judgment , I speak it under favour ,
Not to contrary you , Sir ) very richly ?
Well ?
to be cozen 'd .
Troth , and I think so too ,
By that I heard him , in the latter end .
O , but before , Sir : had you heard him first
Draw it to certain Heads , then aggravate ,
Then use his vehement Figures ?
I look 'd still
When he would shift a Shirt ; and doing this
Out of pure Love , no hope of Gain ?
' Tis right .
I cannot answer him , Mosca , as I would ,
Not yet ; but for thy sake , at thy entreaty ,
I will begin , ev'n now , to vex 'em all ,
This very instant .
Good , Sir . Volp .
Call the Dwarf
And Eunuch forth .
Castrone , Nano .
Shall we have a Jig , now ?
What you please , Sir . Volp .
Go ,
Strait give out about the Streets , you two ,
That I am dead ; do it with constancy ,
Sadly , do you hear ?
Impute it to the Grief
Of this late Slander .
What do you mean , Sir ?
O ,
I shall have instantly my Vulture , Crow ,
Raven , come flying hither , ( on the News )
To peck for Carrion , my She-Wolf , and all ,
Greedy , and full of expectation ?
And then to have it ravish 'd from their Mouths ?
' Tis true ; I will ha' thee put on a Gown ,
And take upon thee , as thou wert mine Heir ;
Shew 'em a Will : Open that Chest , and reach
Forth one of those that has the Blanks ; I 'll strait
Put in thy Name .
It will be rare , Sir . Volp .
I ,
When they ev'n gape , and find themselves deluded ?
And thou use them scurvily .
Dispatch , get on thy Gown .
But what , Sir , if they ask
After the Body ?
Say , it was corrupted .
I 'll say , it stunk , Sir ; and was fain t ' have it
Coffin 'd up instantly , and sent away .
Any thing , what thou wilt .
Hold , here 's my Will .
Get thee a Cap , a Count-book , Pen and Ink ,
Papers afore thee ; sit as thou wert taking
An Inventory of Parcels : I 'll get up
Behind the Curtain , on a Stool , and hearken ;
Sometime peep over , see how they do look ,
With what Degrees their Blood doth leave their Faces !
O , 'twill afford me a rare Meal of Laughter .
Your Advocate will turn stark dull upon it .
It will take off his Oratories edge .
But your Clarissimo , old Round-back , he
Will crump you , like a Hog-louse , with the touch .
And what Corvino ?
O , Sir , look for him ,
To morrow morning , with a Rope and a Dagger ,
To visit all the Streets ; he must run mad .
My Lady too , that came into the Court ,
To bear False-witness for your Worship ?
Yes ,
And kiss me 'fore the Fathers , when my Face
Flow 'd all with Oils .
And Sweat , Sir . VVhy your Gold
Is such another Med'cine , it dries up
All those offensive Savours : It transforms
The most deformed , and restores 'em lovely ,
As 'twere the strange Poetical Girdle .
Jove
Could not invent t ' himself a Shroud more subtile
To pass Acrisius Guards .
It is the thing
Makes all the VVorld her Grace , her Youth , her Beauty .
I think she loves me .
Who ?
the Lady , Sir ?
She 's jealous of you .
Dost thou say so ?
Heark ,
There 's some already .
It is the Vulture ;
He has the quickest Scent .
I 'll to my Place ,
Thou to thy Posture .
I am set .
But Mosca ,
Play the Artificer now , torture 'em rarely .
Turky Carpets , nine ?
Taking an Inventory ?
That is well .
Two Sutes of Bedding , Tissue ?
Where 's the Will ?
Let me read that the while .
So , set me down ,
And get you home .
Is he come now , to trouble us ?
Of Cloth of Gold , two more ?
Is it done , Mosca ?
Of several Velvets , eight ? ?
I like his Care .
Dost thou not hear ?
Ha ?
is the Hour come , Mosca ?
I ,
The Fox .
175
I now they muster .
behind a Traverse .
What does the Advocate here ,
Or this Corbaccio ?
What do these here ?
Mosca ?
Is his Thred spun ?
Eight Chests of Linen ?
O ,
My Fine Dame Would-be too ! Corv.
Mosca , the Will ,
That I may shew it these , and rid 'em hence .
Six Chests of Diaper , four of Damask ?
Is that the Will ?
Down Beds and Bolsters ?
Rare !
Be busie still .
Now they begin to flutter :
They never think of me .
Look , see , see , see !
How their swift Eyes run over the long Deed .
Unto the Name , and to the Legacies ,
What is bequeath 'd them there ?
Ten Sutes of Hangings ?
I , i' their Garters , Mosca .
Now their Hopes
Are at the gasp.
Mosca the Heir ! Corb .
What 's that ?
My Advocate is dumb ; look to my Merchant ,
He has heard of some strange Storm , a Ship is lost ,
He faints ; my Lady will swoon .
Old Glazen-eyes ,
He hath not reach 'd his Despair yet .
All these
Are out of hope ; I 'm sure the Man .
But Mosca ?
Two Cabinets ?
Is this in earnest ?
One
Of Ebony ?
Or do you but delude me ?
The other , Mother of Pearl ?
I am very busie .
Good faith , it is a Fortune thrown upon me ?
Item , one Salt of Agat ?
not my seeking .
Do you hear , Sir ?
A perfum 'd Box ?
'Pray you forbear ,
You see I am troubled ?
made of an Onyx ?
How !
To morrow or next day I shall be at leisure
To talk with you all .
Is this my large Hopes Issue ?
Sir , I must have a fairer Answer .
Madam !
Marry , and shall : 'Pray you , fairly quit my House .
Nay , raise no Tempest with your Looks ; but heark you ,
Remember what your Ladiship offer 'd me
To put you in an Heir ; go to , think on't :
And what you said e 'en your best Madams did
For Maintenance ; and why not you ?
Go home , and use the poor Sir Pol your Knight well ,
For fear I tell some Riddles : Go , be melancholy .
O , my fine Devil ! Corv.
Mosca , 'pray you a word .
Lord ! will not you take your Dispatch hence yet ?
Methinks ( of all ) you should have been th ' Example .
Why should you stay here ?
with what thought , what promise ?
Hear you ?
do you not know , I know you an Ass ?
And that you would most fain have been a Wittol ,
If Fortune would have let you ?
that you are
A declar 'd Cuckold , on good Terms ?
This Pearl ,
You 'll say , was yours ?
Right : This Diamond ?
I 'll not deny 't , but thank you .
Much here else ?
It may be so .
Why , think that these good Works
May help to hide your bad : I 'll not betray you ;
Although you be but extraordinary
And have it only in Title , it sufficeth .
Go home , be melancholy too , or mad .
Rare Mosca ! How his Villany becomes him !
Certain he doth delude all these for me .
Mosca the Heir ?
O his four Eyes have found it .
I am cozen 'd , cheated , by a Parosite-slave ;
Harlot , t ' hast gull 'd me .
Yes , Sir . Stop your mouth ,
Or I shall draw the only Tooth is left .
Are not you he , that filthy covetous Wretch ,
With the three Legs , that here , in hope of prey ,
Have any time this three years snufft about ,
VVith your most grov'ling Nose , and would have hir 'd
Me to the pois'ning of my Patron , Sir ?
Are not you he that have to day in Court
Profess 'd the disinheriting of your Son ?
Perjur 'd your self ; Go home , and die , and stink ;
If you but croak a Syllable , all comes out :
Away , and call your Porters , go , go , stink .
Excellent Varlet ! Volt .
Now , my faithful Mosca ,
I find thy Constancy .
Sir ?
A Table
Of Porphiry ?
I mar 'le you 'll be thus troublesom .
Nay , leave off now , they are gone .
VVhy ?
who are you ?
VVhat ?
who did send for you ?
O , cry you mercy ,
Reverend Sir ! Good faith , I am griev 'd for you ,
That any Chance of mine should thus defeat
Your ( I must needs say ) most deserving Travels :
But I protest , Sir , it was cast upon me ,
And I could almost wish to be without it ,
But that the VVill o ' th ' Dead must be observ 'd .
Marry , my joy is , that you need it not ,
You have a Gift , Sir , ( thank your Education )
VVill never let you want , while there are Men ,
And Malice , to breed Causes .
VVould I had
But half the like , for all my Fortune , Sir .
If I have any Sutes ( as I do hope ,
Things being so easie and direct , I shall not )
I will make bold with your obstreperous Aid ,
( Conceive me ) for your Fee , Sir . In mean time ,
You that have so much Law , I know ha' the Conscience
Not to be Covetous of what is mine ,
Good Sir , I thank you for my Place ; 'twill help
To set up a young Man .
Good faith , you look
As you were costive ; best go home and purge , Sir .
Bid him eat Lettuce well : My witty Mischief ,
Let me embrace thee .
O that I could now
Transform thee to a Venus ?
Mosca , go ,
Streight take my Habit of Clarissimo ,
And walk the Streets , be seen , torment 'em more :
We must pursue , as well as plot .
Who would
Have lost this Feast ?
I doubt it will lose them .
O , my Recovery shall recover all .
That I could now but think on some Disguise
To meet 'em in , and ask 'em Questions :
How I would vex 'em still at every turn ?
Sir , I can fit you .
Canst thou ?
Yes , I know
One o ' the Commandatori , Sir , so like you ;
Him will I streight make drunk , and bring you his Habit .
A rare Disguise , and answering thy Brain !
O , I will be a sharp Disease unto 'em .
Sir , you must look for Curses ? ?
Till they burst ;
The Fox fares ever best when he is curst .
I warrant you .
All my Ambition is to fright him only .
If you could Ship him away , 'twere excellent .
To Zant , or to Aleppo ?
Yes , and ha' his
Adventures put i' th ' Book of Voyages ,
And his gull 'd Story registred for Truth ?
Well , Gentlemen , when I am in a while ,
And that you think us warm in our Discourse ,
Know your Approaches .
Trust it to our Care .
Save you , fair Lady .
Is Sir Pol within ?
I do not know , Sir . Per .
Pray you , say unto him ,
Here is a Merchant , upon earnest Business ,
Desires to speak with him .
I will see , Sir . Per .
Pray you .
I see the Family is all Female here .
He says , Sir , he has weighty Affairs of State ,
That now require him whole ; some other time
You may possess him .
Pray you say again ,
If those require him whole , these will exact him ,
Whereof I bring him Tidings .
What might be
His grave Affair of State now ?
how to make
Bolognian Sausages here in Venice , sparing
One
176 The Fox .
One o ' th ' ingredients .
Sir , he says , he knows
By your Word , Tidings , that you are no Statesman ,
And therefore wills you stay .
Sweet , pray you return him ;
I have not read so many Proclamations ,
And studied them for Words , as he has done ;
But ?
Here he deigns to come .
Sir , I must crave
Your courteous Pardon .
There hath chanc 'd ( to day )
Unkind Disaster 'twixt my Lady and me ,
And I was penning my Apology
To give her satisfaction , as you came now .
Sir , I am griev 'd , I bring you worse Disaster ;
The Gentleman you met at th ' Port to day ,
That told you , he was newly arriv 'd ?
I , was
A fugitive Punk ?
No, Sir , a Spy set on you ;
And he has made relation to the Senate ,
That you profest to him to have a Plot
To sell the State of Venice to the Turk .
O me !
For which , Warrants are sign 'd by this time ,
To apprehend you , and to search your Study
For Papers ?
Alas , Sir , I have none , but Notes ,
Drawn out of Play-books ?
All the better , Sir .
And some Essays .
What shall I do ?
Sir , best
Convey your self into a Sugar-chest ,
Or , if you would lie round , a Frail were rare ,
And I could send you aboard .
Sir , I but talk 'd so ,
For Discourse-sake meerly .
Heark , they are there .
I am a Wretch , a Wretch .
What will you do , Sir ?
Ha' you ne 'er a Curran-But to leap into ?
They 'll put you to the Rack , you must be sudden .
Sir , I have an Ingine ?
Sir Politick Would-be ?
Where is he ? )
That I have thought upon before-time .
What is it ?
( I shall ne 'er endure the Torture . )
Marry , it is , Sir , of a Tortoise-shell ,
Fitted for these Extremities : pray you , Sir , help me .
Here I have a place , Sir , to put back my Legs ,
( Please you to lay it on , Sir ) with this Cap ,
And my black Gloves .
I 'll lie , Sir , like a Tortoise ,
Till they are gone .
And call you this an Ingine ?
My own Device ?
Good Sir , bid my Wifes Women
To burn my Papers .
Where 's he hid ?
We must
And will sure find him .
Which is his Study ?
What
Are you , Sir ?
I am a Merchant , that came here
To look upon this Tortoise ?
How ?
Mark !
What Beast is this ?
It is a Fish .
Come out here .
Nay , you may strike him Sir , and tread upon him :
He 'll bear a Cart .
What , to run over him ?
Yes , Sir .
Let 's jump upon him .
Can he not go ?
He creeps , Sir .
Let 's see him creep.
No, good Sir , you will hurt him .
( Heart ) I 'll see him creep , or prick his Guts .
Come out here .
Pray you Sir , ( creep a little . )
Yet farther .
Good Sir , ( creep. )
and discover him .
We 'll see his Legs .
Gods so , he has Garters !
I , and Gloves ! Mer .
Is this
Your fearful Tortoise ?
Now , Sir Pol , we are even ;
For your next Project I shall be prepar 'd :
I am sorry for the Funeral of your Notes , Sir .
' Twere a rare Motion to be seen in Fleetstreet .
I , i' the Term .
Or Smithfield , in the Fair .
Methinks 'tis but a melancholy Sight .
Farewel , most Politick Tortoise .
Where 's my Lady ?
Knows she of this ?
I know not , Sir . Pol .
O , I shall be the Fable of all Feasts ,
The Freight of the Gazetti , Ship-boys Tale ;
And , which is worst , even Talk for Ordinaries .
My Lady 's come most melancholy home ,
And says , Sir , she will streight to Sea , for Physick .
And I , to shun this Place and Clime for ever ,
Creeping with House on Back , and think it well
To shrink my poor Head in my Politick Shell .
AM I then like him ?
O , Sir , you are he :
No Man can sever you .
But what am I ?
' Fore Heaven , a brave Clarissimo , thou becom 'st it .
Pity thou wert not born one .
If I hold
My made one , 'twill be well .
I 'll go and see
What News first at the Court .
Do so .
My Fox
Is out on his Hole , and ere he shall re-enter ,
I 'll make him languish in his borrow 'd Case ,
Except he come to Composition with me :
Androgyno , Castrone , Nano .
Go , recreate your selves abroad ; go , sport .
So , now I have the Keys , and am possest .
Since he will needs be dead afore his time ,
I 'll bury him , or gain by him .
I am his Heir ,
And so will keep me , till he share at least .
To cozen him of all , were but a Cheat
Well plac 'd ; no Man would construe it a Sin :
Let his Sport pay for't ; this is call 'd the Fox-trap .
We must maintain
Our first tale good , for both our Reputations .
Why ?
mine 's no Tale : my Son would there
have kill 'd me .
That 's true , I had forgot ; mine is , I am sure .
But for your Will , Sir . Corb .
I , I 'll come upon him
For that hereafter , now his Patron 's dead .
Signior Corvino! and Corbaccio! Sir ,
Much joy unto you .
Of what ?
The sudden Good
Dropt down upon you ?
Where ?
( And none knows how . )
From old Volpone , Sir . Corb .
Out , errant Knave .
Let not your too much Wealth , Sir , make you
Away , thou Varlet .
Why , Sir ?
Dost thou mock me ?
You mock the World , Sir ;
Did you not change Wills ?
Out , Harlot .
O ! belike you are the Man ,
Signior Corvino ?
' Faith , you carry it well ;
You grow not mad withal : I love your Spirit :
You are not over-leaven 'd with your Fortune .
You should ha' some would swell now , like a Wine-fat ,
With such an Autumn ?
Did he gi' you all , Sir ?
Avoid , you Rascal .
Troth , your Wife has shewn
Her self a very Woman : but you are well ,
You need not care , you have a good Estate ,
To
The Fox .
177
To bear it out , Sir , better by this Chance :
Except Corbaccio have a Share ?
Hence , Varlet .
You will not be a' known , Sir ; why , 'tis wise .
Thus do all Gamesters , at all Games , dissemble .
No Man will seem to win .
Here comes my Vulture ,
Heaving his Beak up i' the Air , and snuffing .
a Slave ?
Would run on Errands , and make Legs for Crumbs ?
Well , what I 'll do ? ?
The Court stays for your worship .
I e 'en rejoice , Sir , at your Worships Happiness ,
And that it fell into so learned Hands ,
That understand the fingering ?
What do you mean ?
I mean to be a Suitor to your Worship ,
For the small Tenement , out of Reparations ,
That at the end of your long row of Houses ,
By the Piscaria : It was , in Volpone 's time ,
Your Predecessor , e 'er he grew Diseas 'd ,
A handsom , pretty , custom 'd Bawdy-house ,
As any was in Venice , ( none disprais 'd )
But fell with him ; his Body and that House
Decay 'd together .
Come , Sir , leave your prating .
Why , if your Worship give me but your Hand ,
That I may ha' the Refusal , I have done .
' Tis a meer Toy to you , Sir , Candle-rents ,
As your Learn 'd Worship knows ?
What do I know ?
Marry , no end of your wealth , Sir ; God decrease it .
Mistaking Knave ! what , mock 'st thou my Mis -
fortune ?
His Blessing on your heart , Sir ; would 'twere more .
( Now to my first again , at the next Corner . )
That I could shoot mine Eyes at him , like Gun-stones .
But is this true , Sir , of the Parasite ?
Again , t ' afflict us ?
Monster !
In good faith , Sir ,
I am heartily griev 'd , a Beard of your grave length
Should be so over-reach 'd .
I never brook 'd
That Parasite 's Hair ; methough this Nose should cozen :
There still was somewhat in his Look , did promise
The Bane of a Clarissimo .
Knave ?
Methinks
Yet you , that are so traded i' the World ,
A witty Merchant , the fine Bird , Corvino ,
That have such mortal Emblems on your Name ,
Should not have sung your Shame , and dropt your Cheese ,
To let the Fox laugh at your Emptiness .
Sirrah , you think the Privilege of the Place ,
And your red saucy Cap , that seems ( to me )
Nail 'd to your Jolt-head , with those two Cecchines ,
Can warrant your Abuses ; come you hither :
You shall perceive , Sir , I do know your Valour well ,
Since you durst publish what you are , Sir . Corv.
Tarry ,
I'ld speak with you .
Sir , Sir , another time ?
Nay , now .
O God , Sir ! I were a wise Man ,
Would stand the Fury of a distracted Cuckold .
What , come again ?
Upon 'em , Mosca ; save me .
The Air 's infected where he breaths .
Let 's fly him .
Excellent Basilisk ! turn upon the Vulture .
Your Winter will come on .
Good Advocate ,
Pr'ythee not rail , nor threaten out of place thus ;
Thou'lt make a Sol?cism
( as Madam says . )
Get you a Biggen more ; your Brain breaks loose .
Well , Sir .
Would you ha' me beat the insolent Slave ?
Throw Dirt upon his first good Clothes ?
This same
Is doubtless some Familiar .
Sir , the Court
In troth , stays for you ; I am mad , a Mule ,
That never read Justinian , should get up ,
And ride an Advocate .
Had you no Quirk
To avoid Gullage , Sir , by such a Creature ?
I hope you do but jest ; he has not do n't :
This 's but Confederacy , to blind the rest .
You are the Heir ?
A strange , officious ,
Troublesom Knave ! thou dost torment me .
I know ?
It cannot be , Sir , that you should be cozen 'd ;
' Tis not within the Wit of Man to do it ;
You are so wise , so prudent ; and 'tis fit
That Wealth and Wisdom still should go together .
All but the Advocate .
And here he comes .
Then bring 'em forth to Sentence .
O , my most honour 'd Fathers , let your Mercy
Once win upon your Justice , to forgive ?
I am distracted ?
What will he do now ? )
O ,
I know not which t ' address my self to first ,
Whether your Fatherhoods , or these Innocents ?
Will he betray himself ? )
Whom equally
I have abus 'd , by my false Accusation :
For which , now struck in Conscience , here I prostrate
My self at your offended Feet , for Pardon .
1 , 2.
O Heav'n , how just thou art ! Volp .
I am caught
I ' my own Noose ?
Be constant , Sir : nought now
Can help , but Impudence .
Speak forward .
It is not Passion in me , Reverend Fathers ,
But only Conscience , Conscience , my good Sires ,
That makes me now tell Truth .
That Parasite ,
That Knave hath been the Instrument of all .
Where is that Knave ?
fetch him .
I go .
Grave Fathers ,
This Man 's distracted ; he confest it now :
For hoping to be old Volpone 's Heir ,
Who now is dead ?
How ! Avoc.
Is Volpone dead ?
Dead since , Grave Fathers ?
O sure Vengeance ! Avoc.
Stay ,
Then he was no Deceiver .
O no , none :
The Parasite , Grave Fathers .
He does speak
Out of meer Envy , 'cause the Servant 's made
The thing he gap't for : Please your Fatherhoods ,
This is the Truth , though I 'll not justifie
The other , but he may be some-deal faulty .
I , to your Hopes , as well as mine , Corvino :
But I 'll use Modesty .
Pleaseth your Wisdoms
To view these certain Notes , and but confer them ;
As I hope Favour , they shall speak clear Truth .
The Devil has enter 'd him ! Bon .
Or bides in you .
VVe have done ill , by a Publick Officer
To send for him , if he be Heir .
For whom ?
A a Avoc.
Him
178 The Fox .
Him that they call the Parasite .
' Tis true ,
He is a Man of great Estate , now left .
Go you , and learn his Name , and say , the Court
Intreats his Presence here , but to the clearing
Of some few Doubts .
This same 's a Labyrinth !
Stand you unto your first Report .
My State ,
My Life , my Fame ?
( Where is't ? )
Are at the Stake .
Is yours so too ?
The Advocate 's a Knave ,
And has a forked Tongue ?
Speak to the Point . )
So is the Parasite too .
This is Confusion .
I do beseech your Fatherhoods , read but those .
And credit nothing the false Spirit hath writ :
It cannot be , but he is possest , Grave Fathers .
My Head into it , wilfully ! with Laughter !
When I had newly scap't , was free , and clear !
Out of meer Wantonness ! O , the dull Devil
Was in this Brain of mine , when I devis 'd it ,
And Mosca gave it second ; He must now
Help to sear up this Vein , or we bleed dead .
How now ! who let you loose ?
whither go you now ?
VVhat , to buy Gingerbread , or to drown Kitlings ?
Sir , Master Mosca call 'd us out of doors ,
And bid us all go play , and took the Keys .
Did Master Mosca take the Keys ?
why , so !
I am farther in .
These are my fine Conceits !
I must be merry , with a mischief to me !
VVhat a vile VVretch was I , that could not bear
My Fortune soberly ?
I must ha' my Crotchets !
And my Conundrums ! VVell , go you , and seek him :
His Meaning may be truer than my Fear .
Bid him , he streight come to me to the Court ;
Thither will I , and , if't be possible ,
Unscrew my Advocate , upon new Hopes :
VVhen I provok 'd him , then I lost my self .
He here
Professeth , that the Gentleman was wrong 'd ,
And that the Gentlewoman was brought thither ,
Forc 'd by her Husband , and there left .
Most true .
How ready is Heav'n to those that pray !
But that
Volpone would have ravish 'd her , he holds
Utterly false , knowing his Impotence .
Grave Fathers , he is possest ; again , I say ,
Possest : Nay , if there be Possession ,
And Obsession , he has both .
Here comes our Officer .
The Parasite will streight be here , Grave Fathers .
You might invent some other Name , Sir Varlet .
Did not the Notary meet him ?
Not that I know .
His coming will clear all .
Yet it is misty .
May 't please your Fatherhoods ?
Sir , the Parasite
Will 'd me to tell you , that his Master lives
That you are still the Man , your Hopes the same ;
And this was only a Jest ? ?
How ?
Sir , to try
If you were firm , and how you stood affected .
Art sure he lives ?
Do I live , Sir ?
O me !
I was too violent .
Sir , you may redeem it :
They said , you were possest ; fall down , and seem so :
I 'll help to make it good .
God bless the Man !
( Stop your wind hard , and swell ) see , see , see , see !
He vomits crooked Pins ! his Eyes are set ,
Like a dead Hares , hung in a Poulterer 's Shop !
His Mouth 's running away ! Do you see , Signior ?
Now 'tis in his Belly .
I , the Devil ! )
Now in his Throat .
I , I perceive it plain . )
' Twill out , 'twill out , stand clear .
See where it flies ,
In shape of a blue Toad , with Bats VVings !
Do you not see it , Sir ?
VVhat ?
I think I do .
' Tis too manifest .
Look ! he comes t ' himself !
VVhere am I ?
Take good heart , the worst is past , Sir .
You are dispossest .
VVhat Accident is this ?
Sudden , and full of wonder ! Av.
If he were
Possest , as it appears , all this is nothing .
He has been often subject to these Fits .
Shew him that VVriting : Do you know it , Sir ?
Deny it , Sir , forswear it , know it not .
Yes , I do know it well , it is my Hand :
But all that it contains , is false .
O Practice !
What Maze is this ! Av.
Is he not guilty then ,
Whom you there name the Parasite ?
Grave Fathers ,
Why , he is dead ?
O no , my honour 'd Fathers ,
He lives ?
How ! lives ?
This is subtler yet !
You said , he was dead .
You said so .
I heard so .
Here comes the Gentleman , make him way .
A Stool .
A proper Man ; and , were Volpone dead ,
A fit Match for my Daughter .
Give him way .
Mosca , I was a 'most lost ; the Advocate
Has betray 'd all ; but now it is recover 'd :
All 's o ' the Hinge again ?
Say , I am living .
What busie Knave is this ! Most reverend Fathers ,
I sooner had attended your grave Pleasures ,
But that my Order for the Funeral
Of my dear Patron did require me ?
Mosca ! )
Whom I intend to bury like a Gentleman .
I , quick , and cozen me of all .
Still stranger !
More intricate ! Avoc.
And come about again !
It is a Match , my Daughter is bestow 'd .
Will you gi' me Half ?
First I 'll be hang 'd .
I know
Your Voice is good , cry not so lowd . )
Demand
The Advocate : Sir , did not you affirm
Volpone was alive ?
Yes , and he is ;
This Gent 'man told me so , ( thou shalt have Half . )
Whose Drunkard is this same ?
Speak some that know him :
I never saw his Face .
( I cannot now
Afford it you so cheap .
No? )
What say you ?
The Officer told me .
I did , grave Fathers ,
And will maintain he lives , with mine own Life ,
And that this Creature told me .
( I was born
With all good Stars my enemies . )
Most grave Fathers ,
If such an Insolence as this must pass
Upon me , I am silent : ' Twas not this
For which you sent , I hope .
Take him away .
Mosca ! ) Avoc.
Let him be whipt .
Wilt thou betray me ?
Cozen me ? )
And taught to bear himself
Toward a Person of his Rank .
I humbly thank your Fatherhoods .
Soft , soft , whipt ?
And lose all that I have ?
If I confess ,
It cannot be much more .
Sir , are you married ?
They 'll be ally 'd anon : I must be resolute :
The Fox shall here uncase .
Nay ,
The Fox .
179
Nay , now
My Ruins shall not come alone ; your Match
I 'll hinder sure : my Substance shall not glew you ,
Nor screw you into a Family .
Why , Patron ! )
I am Volpone , and this is my Knave ;
This , his own Knave : this , Avarice 's Fool :
This , a Chimera of Wittal , Fool , and Knave :
And , Reverend Fathers , since we all can hope
Nought but a Sentence , let 's not now despair it .
You hear me brief .
May it please your Fatherhoods ?
The Knot is now undone by Miracle .
Nothing can be more clear .
Or can more prove
These innocent .
Give 'em their Liberty .
Heaven could not long let such gross Crimes be hid .
If this be held the High-way to get Riches ,
May I be poor .
This 's not the Gain , but Torment .
These possess Wealth , as sick men possess Fevers ,
VVhich trulier may be said to possess them .
Disrobe that Parasite .
Most honour 'd Fathers .
Can you plead ought to stay the course of Justice ?
If you can , speak .
VVe beg Favour .
And Mercy .
You hurt your Innocence , suing for the Guilty .
Stand forth ; and first , the Parasite .
You appear
T' have been the chiefest Minister , if not Plotter ,
In all these lewd Impostures ; and now , lastly ,
Have with your Impudence abus 'd the Court ,
And Habit of a Gentleman of Venice ,
Being a Fellow of no Birth , or Blood :
For which , our Sentence is , first , thou be whipt ;
Then live perpetual Prisoner in our Gallies .
I thank you for him .
Bane to thy VVolvish Nature .
Deliver him to the Saffi .
Thou , Volpone ,
By Blood and Rank a Gentleman , canst not fall
Under like Censure ; but our Judgment on thee
Is , That thy Substance all be streight confiscate
To the Hospital of the Incurabili :
And since the most was gotten by Imposture ,
By feigning Lame , Gout , Palsie , and such Diseases ,
Thou art to lie in Prison , crampt with Irons ,
Till thou be 'st sick and lame indeed .
Remove him .
This is call 'd mortifying of a Fox .
Thou , Voltore , to take away the Scandal
Thou hast given all worthy Men of thy Profession ,
Art banisht from their Fellowship , and our State .
Corbaccio , bring him near .
We here possess
Thy Son of all thy State , and confine thee
To the Monastery of San' Spirito ;
Where , since thou knewst not how to live well here ,
Thou shalt be learn 'd to die well .
Ha ! what said he ?
You shall know anon , Sir .
Thou , Corvino , shalt
Be streight imbark 'd from thine own House , and row 'd
Round about Venice , through the Grand Canale ,
Wearing a Cap , with fair long Asses Ears ,
In stead of Horns ; and so to mount ( a Paper
Pinn 'd on thy Breast ) to the Berlino ?
Yes ,
And have mine Eyes beat out with stinking Fish ,
Bruis 'd Fruit , and rotten Eggs ?
' Tis well .
I am glad
I shall not see my Shame yet .
And to expiate
Thy Wrongs done to thy Wife , thou art to send her
Home to her Father , with her Dowry trebled :
And these are all your Judgments .
Honour 'd Fathers . )
Which may not be revok 'd .
Now you begin ,
When Crimes are done , and past , and to be punish 'd ,
To think what your Crimes are : Away with them .
Let all that see these Vices thus rewarded ,
Take Heart , and love to study 'em .
Mischiefs feed
Like Beasts , till they be fat , and then they bleed .
