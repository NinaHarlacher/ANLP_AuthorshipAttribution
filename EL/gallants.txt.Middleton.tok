Is your pawn good and sound , sir ?
I 'll pawn my life for that , sir .
Place yourself there then ; I will seek to prefer it presently .
My master is very jealous of the pestilence ; marry , the pox sits
at meat and meal with him .

ARTHUR
May it please your worship--
" Lent to Master Andrew Lucifer upon his flame-coloured
doublet and blue taffeta hose"--Top the candle , sirrah ; methinks
the light burns blue : when came that suit in ?
' T'as lain above the year now .
Fire and brimstone ! Cut it out into matches ; the white linings
will serve for tinder .
And with little help , sir ; they are almost black enough already .
Sir , here 's another come with a pawn .
Keep him aside awhile , and reach me hither the bill of the last
week .
' Tis here at hand , sir .
Now , sir , what 's your pawn ?
The second part of a gentlewoman 's gown , sir ; the lower half ,
I mean .
I apprehend you easily , the breeches of the gown .
FIRST FELLOW
Very proper , for she wears the doublet at home ; a guest that lies
in my house , sir ; she looks every hour for her cousin out a' th '
country .
O , her cousin lies here ; 'a may mistake in that . My friend , of
what parish is your pawn ?
FIRST FELLOW
Parish ? Why , Saint Clement 's , sir .
Saint Bride 's , five ; Saint Dunstan 's , none ; Saint Clement 's ,
three . " Three at Clement 's ? Away with your pawn , sir , your
parish is infected ! I will neither purchase the plague for sixpence
in the pound and a groat bill-money , nor venture my small stock
into contagious parishes : you have your answer ; fare you well ,
as fast as you can , sir .
The pox arrest you , sir , at the suit of the suburbs !
Ay , welcome , welcome .
FIRST FELLOW
For , I think , plague scorns your company .
I rank with chief gallants ; I love to smell safely .
" Lent in the vacation to Master Proctor upon his spiritual
gown five angels , and upon his corporal doublet fifteen shillings ;
sum , three pound five shillings . "
Sir--
Now , sir ?
Here 's one come in with a trunk
of apparel .
Whence comes it ?
From Saint Martin 's-in-the-Field .
Saint Martin 's-in-the-Field ? " Saint Mary
Maudlin , two ; Saint Martin 's , none . " Here 's an honest fellow ;
let him appear , sir .
You may come near , sir .
O welcome , welcome ; what 's your pawn , sir ?
Faith , a gentlewoman 's whole suit , sir .
Whole suit ? ' Tis well .
SECOND FELLOW
A poor , kind soul , troubled with a bad husband ; one that puts
her to her shifts here .
He puts here from her shifts , methinks , when she is fain to pawn
her clothes .
Look you , sir ; a fair satin gown , new taffeta petticoat--
Stay , this petticoat has been turned .
Often turned up and down , and you will , but never turned , sir .
Cry you mercy , indeed .
A fine white beaver , pearl band , three falls ; I ha' known her
have more in her days .
Alas , and she be but a gentlewoman of any count or charge , three
falls are nothing in these days ! Know that : tut , the world 's
changed ; gentlewomen 's falls stand upright now ; no sin but has
a bolster , that it may lie at ease . Well , what do you borrow
of these , sir ?
Twelve pounds , and you will , sir .
How ?
They were not her 's for twenty .
Why , so ; our pawn is ever thrice the value of our money , unless
in plate and jewels ; how should the months be restored and the
use else ? We must cast it for the twelvemonth , so many pounds ,
so many months , so many eighteenpences ; then the use of these
eighteenpences ; then the want of the return of those pounds : all
these must be laid together ; which well considered , the valuation
of the pawn had need to sound treble . Can six pound pleasure
the gentlewoman ?
It may please her , but , like a man of three-score , in the limberest
degree .
I have but one word more to say in't ; twenty nobles is all and
the utmost that I will hazard upon't .
She must be content with't : the less borrowed , the better paid ;
come .
Arthur .
At hand , sir .
Tell out twenty nobles , and take her name in a bill .
I 'm satisfied , sir .
Welcome , good Saint Martin 's-in-the-Field , welcome , welcome !
I know no other name .
What , so hard at your prayers ?
A little , sir ; summing up my pawns here--what , Master Primero ,
is it you , sir gallant ? And how does all the pretty , sweet ladies ,
those plump , kind , delicate blisses , ha ? whom I kiss in my very
thoughts ? How do they , gallant ?
Why , gallant , if they should not do well in my house , where should
it be done , boy ? Have I not a glorious situation ?
O , a gallant receipt : violet air , curious garden , quaint walks ,
fantastical arbours , three back doors , and a coach-gate ! Nay ,
thou'rt admirably seated : little furniture will serve thee ; thou'rt
never without moveables .
Ay , praise my stars ! Ah , the goodly virginities that have been
cut up in my house , and the goodly patrimonies that have lain
like sops in the gravy ! And when those sops were eaten , yet the
meat was kept whole for another , and another , and another ; for
as in one pie twenty may dip their sippits , so upon one woman
forty may consume their patrimonies .
Excellent , Master Primero!
Well , I 'll pray for women while I live ;
They 're the profitablest fools , I 'll say that for 'em ,
A man can keep about his house ; the prettiest kind fowl ,
So tame , so gentle , e 'en to strangers ' hands
So soon familiar , suffer to be touch 'd
Of those they ne 'er saw twice : the dove 's not like 'em .
Most certain , for that 's honest : but I have
A suit to you .
And so have I to you .
That happens well : grant mine , and I 'll grant yours .
A match .
Make me perfect in that trick that got you so much at primero .
O , for the thread tied at your partner 's leg ,
The twitch ?
Ay , that twitch and you call 't so .
That secret twitch got me five hundred pound
Ere 'twas first known , and since I ha' sold it well :
Five hundred pound laid down shall not yet buy
The fee-simple of my twitch : I would be here with't .
' Twas a best invention ;
I 'd been a beggar many a lousy year
But for my twitch : it was the prettiest twitch !
Many over-cheated gulls have fatted
Me with the bottom of their patrimonies ,
E'en to the last sop , gaped while I fed 'em ,
Who now live by that art that first undid 'em ,
But I must swear you to be secret , close .
As a maid at ten .
Had you sworn but two years higher
I would ne 'er ha' believ 'd you .
Nay , I let twelve alone ,
For after twelve has struck , maids look for one .
I look for one too , and a maid , I think .
What , to come hither ?
Sure , she follows me :
A pretty , fat-eyed wench , with a Venus in her cheek ; did but raiment
smile upon her , she were nectar for great dons , boy : and that 's
my suit to thee .
And that 's granted already . Of what volume is this book , that
I may fit a cover to't ?
Faith , neither in folio nor in decimo sexto , but in octavo , between
both ; a pretty , middle-sized trug.
Then I have fitted her already , in my eye , i'faith . Here came
a pawn in e 'en now will make shift to serve her as fit ! Look
you , sir gallant : satin , taffeta , beaver , fall , and all .
Is it new ?
New ? You see it bears her youth as freshly .
A pretty suit of clothes , i'faith : but put case the party should
come to redeem 'em of a sudden ?
Pooh , then your wit 's sickly : have not I the policy , think you ,
to seem extreme busy , and defer 'em till the morrow ? Against
which time that pawn shall be secretly fetched home , and another
carried out to supply the place .
I like thy craft well there .
A general course . O , frippery is an unknown benefit , sir gallant !
And what must I give you for the hire now , i'faith ?
Of the whole suit , for the month ?
Ay , for the month .
Go to , you shall give me but twelvepence a-day ; Master Primero ,
you 're a friend , and I 'll use you so : 'tis got up at your house
in an afternoon , i'faith , the hire of the whole month . Ye must
think I can distinguish spirits , and put a difference between
you and others ; you pay no more , i'faith .
I could have offered you no less myself .
Tut , a man must use a friend as a friend may use him : your house
has been a sweet house to me , both for pleasure and profit ; I 'll
give you your due : you have always
profit now .
You flatter , you flatter , sir gallant . But whist ! Here she enters :
I prithee , question her .
O , you 're welcome !
Is this your new scholar , Master Primero ?
Marry , is she , sir .
I 'll commend your judgment in a wench while I live : that face
will get money , i'faith ; 'twill be a get-penny , I warrant you .
Go to , your fortune was choice , pretty bliss ,
to fall into the regard of so kind a gentleman .
I hope so , sir .
See what his care has provided already for you ; you 'll be simply
set out to the world ! If you 'll have that care now to deserve
his pains , O , that will be acceptable ! And these be the rudiments
you must chiefly point at : to counterfeit cunningly , to wind in
gentlemen with powerful attraction to keep his house in name and
custom , to dissemble with your own brother , never to betray your
fellows ' imperfections nor lay open the state of their bodies
to strangers , to believe those that give you , to gull those that
believe you , to laugh at all under taffeta ; and these be your
rudiments .
There 's e 'en all , i'faith ; we 'll trouble you with no more . Nay ,
you shall live at ease enough : for nimming away jewels and favours
from gentlemen , which are your chief vails , I hope that will
come naturally enough to you , I need not instruct you ; you 'll
have that wit , I trust , to make the most of your pleasure .
I hope one 's mother-wit will serve for that , sir .
O , properest of all , wench ! It must be a she-wit that does those
things , and thy mother was quick enough at it in her days .
Give me leave , sister , to examine you upon two or three particulars :
and make you ready , be not ashamed ; here 's none but friends .
Are you a maid ?
Yes , in the last quarter , sir .
Very proper , that 's e 'en going out : a maid in the last quarter ,
that 's a whore in the first . Let me see , new moon on Thursday ;
she 'll be changed by that time , too . Are you willing to pleasure
gentlemen ?
We are all born to pleasure our country , forsooth .
Excellent ! Can you carry yourself cunningly , and seem often holy ?
O , fear not that , sir ! My friends were all Puritans .
I 'll ne 'er try her further .
She 's done well , i'faith : I fear not now to turn her loose to
any gentleman in Europe .
You need not , sir : of her own accord , I think she 'll be loose
enough without turning . Arthur !
Here , sir .
Go , make haste , shift her into that suit presently .
It shall be done .
Arthur , do 't neatly , Arthur .
Fear't not , sir .
Follow him , wench .
With all my heart , sir .
But , mass , sir ,
In what are we forgetful all this while !
In what ?
The wooing business , man .
Heart , that 's true !
The gallants will prevent us .
Are you certain ?
I can avouch it : there 's a general meeting
At the deceas 'd knight 's house this afternoon ;
There 's rivalship enough .
No doubt in that :
Would either thou or I might bear her from 'em !
My hopes are not yet faint .
Nor mine .
Tut , man .
Nothing in women 's hearts sooner wins place
Than a grave outside and an impudent face .
And for both those we 'll fit it .
Ay , if the devil
Be not in't : make haste .
I follow straight .
Vanish , thou fog , and sink beneath our brightness ,
Abashed at the splendour of such beams !
We scorn thee , base eclipser of our glories ,
That wouldst have hid our shine from mortal 's eyes .
Now , gallants , I 'm for you , ay , and perhaps before you :
You can appear but glorious from yourselves ,
And have your beams but drawn from your own light ,
But mine from many : many make me bright .
Here 's a diamond that sometimes graced the finger of a countess ;
here sits a ruby that ne 'er lins blushing for the party that pawned
it ; here a sapphire . O providence and fortune ! My beginning
was so poor , I would fain forget it ; and I take the only course ,
for I scorn to think on't ; slave to a trencher , observer of a
salt-cellar , privy to nothing but a closestool , or such unsavoury
secrets : but as I strive to forget the days of my serving , so
I shall once remember the first step of my rising ; for , having
hardly raked five mark together , I rejoiced so in that small stock ,
which most providentially I ventured by water to Blackwall among
fishwives ; and in small time , what by weekly return and gainful
restitution , it rize to a great body , beside a dish of fish for
a present , that stately preserved me a seven-night .
Nor ceas 'd it there , but drew on greater profit ;
For I was held religious by those
That do profess like abstinence ,
And was full often secretly supplied
By charitable Catholics ,
Who censur 'd me sincerely abstinate ,
When merely I for hunger , not for zeal ,
Eat up the fish , and put their alms to use !
Ha , ha , ha !
But those times are run out ; and , for my sake ,
Zealous dissemblance has since far 'd the worse .
Let me see now , whose cloak shall I wear today to continue change ?
O Arthur !
Here , sir .
Bring down Sir Oliver Needy 's taffeta cloak and beaver hat--I
am sure he is fast enough in the knight 's ward--and Andrew Lucifer 's
rapier and dagger with the embossed girdle and hangers ,
for he 's in his third sweat by this time , sipping of the doctor 's
bottle , or picking the ninth part of a rack of mutton , dry-roasted ,
with a leash of nightcaps on his head like the pope 's triple crown ,
and as many pillows crushed to his back , with , " O the needles ! "
For he got the pox of a sempster , and it pricked so much more
naturally . Quick , Arthur , quick !
Now to the deceas 'd knight 's daughter ,
Whom many gallants sue to , I 'mongst many ;
For since impudence gains more respect than virtue ,
And coin than blood , which few can now deny ,
Who 're your chief gallants then but such as I ?
You do your beauties injury , sweet virgin ,
To lose the time they must rejoice in youth :
There 's no perfection in a woman plac 'd
But wastes itself though it be never wasted ;
Then judge your wrongs yourself .
Good Master Fitsgrave ,
Through sorrow for the knight my father 's death ,
Whose being was the perfection of my joy
And crown of my desires , I cannot yet
But forcedly on marriage fix my heart :
Yet heaven forbid I should deject your hopes !
Conceive not of me so uncharitably ;
I should belie my soul if I should say
You are the man I never should affect .
I understand you thus far , you 're a gentleman ,
Whom your estate and virtues may command
To a far worthier breast than this of mine .
O cease ! I dare not hear such blasphemy .
What is without you worthy I neglect ;
In you is plac 'd the worth that I respect .
Vouchsafe , unequall 'd virgin , to accept
This worthless favour from your servant 's arm ,
The hallow 'd beads , whereon I justly kept
The true and perfect number of my sighs .
Mine cannot equal yours , yet in exchange
Accept and wear it for my sake .
Even as my life I 'll rate it .
Heart ! Fitsgrave in such bosom single-loves ?
So close and private with her !
Observe 'em ; he grows proud and bold .
Why , was not this a general meeting ?
By her own consent . Death , how I could taste his blood !
See , the gentlemen ,
At my request , do all present themselves .
Manifold blisses wait on her desire ,
Whose beauty and whose mind so many honour !
I take your wishes thankfully , kind gentlemen ,
All here assembled , over whose long suits
I ne 'er insulted ;
Nor , like that common sickness of our sex ,
Grew proud in the abundance of my suitors ,
Or number of the days they sued unto me .
Dutiful sorrow for my father 's death ,
Not wilful coyness , hath my hours detain 'd
So long in silence .
I 'm left to mine own choice : so much the more
My care calls on me . If I err through love ,
' Tis I must chide myself ; I cannot shift
The fault unto my parents , they 're at rest ,
And I shall sooner err through love than wealth .
Good !
Excellent !
That likes me well .
Hope still .
And my affections do pronounce you all
Worthy their pure and most entire deserts :
Yet they can choose but one ;
Nor do I dissuade any of his hopes ,
Because my heart is not yet thoroughly fix 'd
On marriage or the man ,
But crave the quiet respite of one month ,
The month unto this night ; against which time
I do invite you all to that election ,
Which , on my unstain 'd faith and virgin promise ,
Shall light amongst no strangers , but yourselves .
May this content you ?
Glad and content .
' Tis a good time to leave ;
Till then commend us to your gentlest thoughts .
Enough .
Ough !
Hist , master , hist !
Boy , how now ?
Look you , sir .
Her chain of pearl ?
I sneck 'd it away finely .
Active boy ,
Thy master 's best revenue , his life and soul !
Thou keep'st 'em both together : whip away .
Fall back , fall belly , I must be maintained :
Hope is no purchase ;
Nor care I if I miss her . Why I rank
In this design with gallants , there 's full cause ;
Policy invites me to it :
' Tis not for love , or for her sake alone ;
It keeps my state suspectless and unknown .
Their looks run through and through me , and the stings
Of their snake-hissing whispers pierc 'd my hearing .
They 're mad she grac 'd me with one private minute
Above their fortunes : I 've observed 'em often
Most spitefully aspected toward my happiness ,
Beyond all others ; but the cause I know not .
A quiet month the virgin has enclos 'd
Unto herself ; suitors stand without till then :
In which space cunningly I 'll wind myself
Into their bosoms . I 've bethought the shape ;
Some credulous scholar , easily infected
With fashion , time , and humour : unto such
Their deepest thoughts will , like to wanton fishes ,
Play above water , and be all parts seen :
For since at me their envy pines , I 'll see
Whether their lives from touch of blame sit free .
Mistress Newcut , welcome : here will be choice of gallants for
you anon .
Is all clear ? May I venture ? Am I not seen of the wicked ?
Strange absurdity , that you should come into my house , and ask
if you be not seen of the wicked ! Push ! I take 't unkindly , i'faith :
what think you of my house ? ' Tis no such common receptacle .
Forgive me , sweet Master Primero : I can be content to have my
pleasure as much as another , but I must have a care of my credit ;
I would not be seen anything else . My husband 's at sea , and a
woman shall have an ill report in this world , let her carry herself
never so secretly ; you know't , Master Primero . And what choice
of gallants be they ? Will they be proper gentlemen , think you ?
Nay , sure they are as proper as they will be already .
And I must have choice , you know ; I come for no gain , but for
sheer pleasure and affection .
You see your old spy-hole yonder ; take your stand , please your
own eye . I 'll work it so , the gallants shall present themselves
before you , and in the most conspicuous fashion .
That 's all I can desire till better come.--Look
you .
What mean you , lady ?
A trifle , sir , to buy you silver spurs . Good sir , accept it .
Silver spurs ? A pretty emblem ! Mark it ; all her gifts are about
riding still : the other day she sent me boot-hose wrought in silk
and gold ; now silver spurs . Well , go thy ways , thou'rt as profitable
a spirit as e 'er lighted into my house .
Come , ladies , come , 'tis late ; to music . When ?
You 're best command us , sir ! Our pimp 's grown proud .
To fools and strangers these are gentlewomen
Of sort and worship , knight 's heirs , great in portions ,
Boarded here for their music ;
And oftentimes 't 'as been so cunningly carried ,
That I have had two stolen away at once ,
And married at Savoy , and prov 'd honest shopkeepers :
And I may safely swear they practis 'd music ;
They 're natural at prick-song . A small mist
Will dazzle a fool 's eye , and that 's the world :
So I can thump my hand upon the table
With an austere grace , and cry , " One , two , and three , "
Fret , stamp , and curse , foh , 'twill pass well for me .
How now , sirrah ?
They 're coming in , sir , and strangers in their company .
Tune apace , ladies . Be ready for the song , sirrah .
Nay , I beseech you , gallants , be more inward with this gentleman ;
his parts deserve it .
Whence comes he , sir ?
Piping hot from the university ; he smells of buttered loaves yet ;
Bungler For this our solicitor , he 's a rare fellow five-and-forty
mile hence , believe that : his friends are of the old fashion ,
all in their graves ; and now has he the leisure to follow all
new fashions , ply the brothels , practise salutes and cringes .
Now dear acquaintance ,
I 'll bring you to see fashions .
What house is this , sir ?
O , of great name : here music is profess 'd ;
Here sometimes ladies practise , and the meanest ,
Daughters to men of worship ,
Whom gentlemen , such as ourselves , may visit ,
Court , clip , and exercise our wits upon ;
It is a profess 'd courtesy .
A pretty recreation , i'faith !
I seldom saw so few here : you shall have 'em sometimes in every
corner of the house , with their viols betwixt their legs , and
play the sweetest strokes ; 'twould e 'en filch your soul almost
out of your bosom .
Pax on't , we spoil ourselves for want of these things at university .
You have no such natural happiness : let 's draw near .
Gentlemen , you are all most respectively welcome .
We are bold and insatiate suitors , sir , to the breath of your
music , and the dear sight of those ladies .
And what our poor skill can invite you to ,
You 're kindly welcome : you must pardon 'em , gentlemen ,
Virgins and bashful , besides new beginners :
' Tis not a whole month since they were first enter 'd .
Seven year in my knowledge .
They blush at their very lessons ; they 'll not endure
To hear of a stop , a prick , or a semiquaver .
O , out upon you !
La , I tell you . You 'll bear me witness , gentlemen ,
If their complaints come to their parents ' ears ,
They 're words of art I teach 'em , nought but art .
Why , 'tis most certain .
For all scholars know that
ALL THE COURTESANS
O , beastly word !
Look to the ladies , gentlemen .
Kiss again .
Come , another .
This a good interim .
What have you done , sir ?
Why , what have I done ?
Saw you their stomachs queasy , and come with such gross meat ?
Why , is't not Latin , sir ?
Latin ? Why , then , let the next to't be Latin too .
So , enough .
Nay , I can assure you thus far , I that never knew the language
have heard so much that is Latin for art ; and it may
well be , too , for there 's more art in't nowadays than ever was .
Is't possible ?
I 'm sorry then I 've followed it so far .
A scholar call you him ?
Music must not jar :
The offence is satisfied . Come , to the song ;
Begin , sir .
Not a whole month since you were entered , ladies ?
None that shall see their cunning will believe
it .
It is no affliction , gentlemen .
I care not much , i'faith , if I write down to my father presently
to send up my sister in all haste that I may place her here at
this music-school .
' Slid , 'tis the fool my cousin ! I would
not for the value of three recreations he had seen me here .
How like you your new prize ?
Pray , give me leave ;
I have not yet sufficiently admir 'd her .
My wits must not stand idle . ' Slife , he 's in a sick trance !
A cheat or two among these mistresses
Would not be ill bestow 'd ; I affect none ,
But for my prey : such are their affections ,
I know it ; how could drabs and cheaters live else ?
Then since the world rolls on dissimulation ,
I 'll be the first dissembler .
Prithee , love , comfort , choice ,
My only wish , in thee I am confin 'd !
Deny me anything , a slight chain of pearl ?
Nay , an't be but slight--
Being denied ,
I prize it slight ; but given me by my love ,
Light shall not be so dear unto my eye ,
Mine eye unto the body , as the gift .
How have I power to deny this to you ,
That command all ? My fortunes are thy servants ,
And thou the mistress both of them and me .
The truest that e 'er breathed !
To a gentleman
That thus so long has so sincerely lov 'd you
As I myself , ne 'er was less pity shown .
Why , I never was held cruel .
But to me .
Nor to you .
Go to , 't 'as scar 'd you much .
I 'm sorry your conceit is so unkind
To think me so .
When had I other argument ?
I 've often tender 'd you my love and service ,
And that in no mean fashion ;
Yet were you ne 'er that requiteful mistress
That grac 'd me with one favour ;
' Slight , not so much as such a pretty ring ;
Pax on't , 't 'as almost broke my heart .
Has took it off ! 'Sfoot , Master Goldstone !
Nay , where a man loves most , there to be scanted !
My ring , come , come--
What reckon I a satin gown or two ,
If she were wise ?
Life ! My ring , sir , come--
Have you the face , i'faith ?
Give me my ring .
Prithee , hence ; by this light you get none on't .
How ?
I hold your favours of more pure esteem ,
Than to part from 'em ; faith , I do , howe 'er
You think of me .
Push , pray , sir--
Hark you , go to ;
You 've lost much by unkindness ; go your ways .
'Sfoot !
But yet there 's no time past ; you may redeem it .
Come , I cannot miss it , i' faith ; beside ,
The gentleman that bestowed it on me
Swore to me it cost him twenty nobles .
Twenty nobles ? Pox of twenty nobles !
But you must cost me more , you pretty villain :
Ah , you little rogue !
Come , come , I know you 're but in jest .
In jest ? No, you shall see .
No way will get it :
As good give it him now , and hope for somewhat .
True love made jest !
I did but try thy faith ,
How fast thou 'dst hold it . Now I see a woman
May venture worthy favours to thy trust ,
And have 'em truly kept ; and I protest ,
Had I draw n't from thee , I should ne 'er ha' lov 'd thee ;
I know that .
'Sfoot , I was ne 'er so wronged in my life !
Think you I 'm in jest with you ? What , with my love ?
I could find lighter subjects , you shall see ;
And time will show how much you injure me .
The ring , were it thrice worth , I freely give ,
For I know you 'll requite it .
Will I live ?
Enough .
Why , this was well come off now :
Where 's my old serving-man ? Not yet return 'd ?
O , here he peeps .
Now , sirrah ?
May it please your worship : they 're done artificially , i'faith ,
boy .
Both the great beakers ?
Both , lad .
Just the same size ?
Ay , and the marks as just .
So , fall off respectively now .
My lord desires your worship of all love--
His lordship must hold me excused till morning ; I 'll not break
company tonight . Where sup we , gallants ?
At Mermaid .
Sup there who list , I have forsworn the house .
For the truth is , this plot must take effect at
Mitre .
PURSENET
Faith , I 'm indifferent .
So are we , gentlemen .
Name the place , Master Goldstone .
Why , the Mitre , in my mind , for neat attendance , diligent boys ,
and , push , excels it far !
Agreed , the Mitre then .
PURSENET
Boy ! Some goodness toward : the boy 's whipped
away .
The jewel , heart , the jewel !
How now , sir ? What mov 'd you ?
Nothing , sir ;
A spice of poetry , a kind a' fury ,
A disease runs among scholars .
Mass , it made you stamp .
Whew ,
' Twill make some stamp and stare , make a strange noise ,
Curse , swear , beat tire-men , and kick players ' boys ;
The effects are very fearful .
Bless me from't !
O , you need not fear it , sir . Hell of this luck !
Hark , he 's at it again !
Some pageant-plot ,
Or some device for the tilt-yard : disturb him not .
How can I gain her love , when I have lost her
favour ?
What money hast about thee ? Look you , sir , I must be fain to
pawn a fair stone here for ordinary expenses : a pox of my tenants !
I give 'em twenty days after the quarter , and they cut out forty .
Why , you might take the forfeiture of their leases then .
I know I might ; but what 's their course ? The rogues come me up
all together , with geese and capons , and petitions in pigs ' snouts ,
which would move any man , i'faith , were his stomach ne 'er so great ;
and to see how pitifully the pullen will look , it makes me after
relent , and turn my anger into a quick fire to roast 'em--nay ,
touch't and spare it not .
' Tis right : well , what does your worship borrow of this , sir ?
The stone 's twenty nobles .
Nay , hardly .
As I am a right gentleman .
It comes near it indeed : well , here 's five pound in gold upon't .
' Twill serve ; and the ring safe and secret ?
As a virgin 's .
I wish no higher . What , gallants , are you constant ? Does the
place hold ?
The Mitre .
Sir , in regard of our continued boldness and trouble , which love
to your music hath made us guilty of , shall we entreat your worship 's
company , with these sweet ladies , your professed scholars , to
take part of a poor supper with myself and these gentlemen at
the Mitre ?
Pray , Master Primero .
I beseech you , sir , let it be so .
O , pardon me , sweet gentlemen ; the world 's apt to censure . I
have the charge of them , they 're left in trust , they 're virgins :
and I dare not hazard their fames ; the least touch mars 'em : and
what would their right worshipful parents think , if the report
should fly to them , that they were seen with gentlemen in a tavern ?
All this may be prevented : what serves your coach for ?
They may come coach 'd and mask 'd .
You put me to't , sir ;
Yet I must say again , I fear the drawers
And vintner 's boys will be familiar with them ,
And think 'em mistresses .
There are those places where respect seems slighter ;
More censure is belonging to the Mitre ?
You know that , sir .
Gentlemen , you prevail .
We 'll all expect you there .
And we 'll not fail .
The devil will ne 'er dissemble with them so ,
As you for them .
Come , sir .
What else ? Let 's go .
How cheer you , sir ?
Faith , like the moon , more bright ,
Decreas 'd in body , but re-made in light ;
Here thou shalt share some of my brightness with me .
By my faith , they 're comfortable beams , sir .
Come ,
Where have you spent the time now from my sight ?
I 'm jealous of thy action .
Push ! I did but walk
A turn or two in the garden .
What made you there ?
Nothing but cropp 'd a flower .
Some woman 's honour , I believe .
Foh ! Is this a woman 's honour ?
Much about one ,
When both are pluck 'd , their sweetness is soon gone .
Prithee , be true to me .
When did I fail ?
Yet I am ever doubtful that you sin .
I do account the world but as my spoil ,
To adorn thee :
My love is artificial to all others ,
But purity to thee . Dost thou want gold ?
Here , take this chain of pearl , supply thyself :
Be thou but constant , firm , and just to me ,
Rich heirs shall want ere want come near to thee .
Upon thy lip I seal sincerity .
Was this your vow to me ?
Pox , what 's a kiss to be quite rid of her ?
She 's su 'd so long , I was asham 'd of her :
' Twas but her cheek I kiss 'd neither , to save her Ionging .
' Tis not a kiss I weigh .
Had you weigh 'd this ,
' T 'ad lack 'd above five ounces of a true one ;
No kiss that e 'er weigh 'd lighter .
' Tis thy love that I suspect .
My love ? Why , by this-- What shall I swear by ?
Swear by this jewel ; keep thy oath , keep that .
By this jewel , then , no creature can be perfect
In my love but thy dear self .
I rest content .
Ha , ha , ha ! Let 's laugh at 'em , sweet soul .
Ay , they may laugh at me ;
I was a novice , and believ 'd your oaths .
Why , what do you think of me ? Make I no difference
' Tween seven years ' prostitution and seven days ?
Why , you 're but in the wane of a maid yet .
You wrong my health in thinking I love them :
Do not I know their populous imperfections ?
Why , they cannot live till Easter ,
Let 'em show the fairest side to th ' world ,
Like hundreds more , whose clothes e 'en stand upright
In silver , when their bodies are ready
To drop through 'em ; such there be ; they may deceive
The world , they ne 'er shall me .
Forgive my doubts ;
And for some satisfaction wear this ring ,
From which I vow 'd ne 'er but to thee to part .
With which thou ever bind 'st me to thy heart .
My pocket pick 'd ? This was no brothel-house !
A music school ? Damnation has fine shapes :
I paid enough for the song , I 've lost a jewel
To me more precious than their souls to them
That gave consent to filch it . I 'll hunt hard ,
Waste time and money , trace and wheel about ,
But I will find these secret mischiefs out .
How now ? What 's he ?
O , a servant to my love : being thus disguis 'd ,
I 'll learn some news.--Now , sir ? You belong to me .
I do , sir ; but I cannot stay to say so . Nay , good sir , detain
me not ; I am going in all haste to inquire or lay wait for a chain
of pearl , nimmed out of her pocket the fifth of November , a dismal
day .
Ha ! A chain of pearl , sayst thou ?
A chain of pearl , sir , which one Master Fitsgrave , a gentleman
and a suitor , fastened upon her as a pledge of his love .
Ha !
Urge me no more , I have no more to say
Your friend , Jeronimo Bedlam .
Thou'rt a mad fellow indeed .
Some comfort yet , that hers is missing too ;
I feel my soul at much more ease : both stol 'n !
When griefs have partners they are better borne .
O , the parting of us twain
Hath caus 'd me mickle pain !
And I shall ne 'er be married
Until I see my muggle again .
Hist !
Ha ?
The nimble gentleman , in the celestial stockings--
Has the best smock-fortune to be beloved of women .
Valle loo lo , lille lo lillo , valle loo lee lo lillo!
Valle loo lo , lille lo lillo , valle loo lee
lo lillo!
Ah , sweet gentleman , he keeps it up stately !
Well held , i'faith , sir : mass , and now I remember too , I think
you ne 'er saw my little banqueting box above since I altered it .
Why , have you altered that ?
O , divinely , sir ! The pictures are all new run over again .
Fie !
For what had the painter done , think you ? Drew me Venus naked ,
which is the grace of a man 's room , you know ; and , when he had
done , drew a number of oaken leaves before her : had not lawn been
a hundred times softer , made a better show , and been more gentlewoman-like ?
More lady-like a great deal .
Come , you shall see how 'tis altered now ; I do not think but you 'll
like her .
Where be your liveries ?
They attend without .
Go , call the coach .
Gentlemen , you have excelled in kindness as we in boldness .
So you think amiss , sir .
Kind ladies , we commit you to sweet dreams ,
Ourselves unto the fortune of the dice .
Dice , ho!
You rest firm mine ?
E'en all my soul to thee .
You keep your vows ?
Why , do I breathe or see ?
Is your love constant ?
Ay , to none but thee .
Now gone , ay , now I love nor them nor thee ;
' Slife , I should be cloy 'd , should I love one in three .
O , here 's Master Bouser now .
Save you , sweet gentlemen .
Sweet Master Bouser , welcome .
When come these dice ?
Anon , anon , sir .
Yet anon , anon , sir !
Hast thou shown art in 'em ?
You shall be judge , sir ; here be the tavernbeakers , and here peep
out the fine alchemy knaves , looking like , well , sir , most of
our gallants , that seem what they are not .
Peace , villain , am not I in presence ?
Why , that puts me in mind of the jest , sir .
Again , you chatterer ?
Nay , compare 'em , and spare 'em not .
The bigness of the bore , just the same size ; the marks , no difference .
Away , put money in thy pocket , and offer to draw in upon the
least occasion .
I am no babe , sir .
Hist !
What 's the matter now ?
Give me a pair of false dice ere you go .
Pax on't , you 're so troublesome too , you cannot remember a thing
before ! If I stay a little longer , I shall be staid anon .
Here be dice for your worships .
Oh , come , come !
The vintner himself ?
I 'll shift away these beakers by a slight .
Master Goldstone--
How now , you conjuring rascal ?
Bless your good worship ; you 're in humours , methinks .
Humours ? Say that again .
I said no such word , sir .
Aside Would I had my beakers out on 's fingers !
What 's thy name , vintner ?
Jack , and please your worship .
Turn knight , like thy companions , scoundrel , live upon usury ,
wear thy gilt spurs at thy girdle for fear of slubbering .
Oh no , I hope I shall have more grace than so , sir ! Pray , let
me help your worship .
Cannot I push 'em together without your help ?
O , I beseech your worship ! They 're the two standards of my house .
Standards ? There lie your standards .
Good your worship . I am glad they are out of
his fingers : my wife shall lock 'em up presently ; they shall see
no sun this twelvemonth 's day for this trick .
Let me come to the sight of your standards again .
Your worship shall pardon me . Now you shall not
see 'em in haste , I warrant ye .
I do not desire 't . Ha , ha !
Why , Master Goldstone !
I am for you , gallants . Master Bouser , cry you mercy , sir : why
supped you from us ?
Faith , sir , I met with a couple of my fellow pupils at university ,
and so we renewed our acquaintance and supped together .
Fie , that 's none of the newest fashion , I must tell you that ,
Master Bouser : you must never take acquaintance of any 'a th '
university when you are at London ; nor any of London when you 're
at university . You must be more forgetful , i'faith ; every place
ministers his acquaintance abundantly .
He tells you true , sir .
I warrant you here 's a gentleman will ne 'er commit such an absurdity .
Who , I ? No: 'tis well known , if I be disposed , I 'll forget any
man in a seven-night , and yet look him in the face : nay , let him
ride but ten mile from me , and come home again , it shall be at
my choice whether I 'll remember him or no : I have tried that .
This is strange , sir .
' Tis as a man gives his mind to't , sir : and now you bring me in ,
I remember 'twas once my fortune to be cozened of all my clothes ,
and with my clothes my money ; a poor shepherd , pitying , me , took
me in and relieved me .
' Twas kindly done of him , i'faith .
Nay , you shall see now : 'twas his fortune likewise , not long after ,
to come to me in much distress , i'faith , and with weeping eyes ;
and do you think l remembered him ?
You could not choose .
By my troth , not I ; I forgot him quite , and never remembered him
to this hour .
And yet knew who he was ?
As well as I know you , i'faith : 'tis a gift given to some above
others .
FITSGRAVE
To fools and knaves ; they never miss on't .
Does any make such a wonder at this ? Why , alas ! ' Tis nothing
to forget others ! What say you to those that forget themselves ?
Nay , then , to dice .
Come , set me , gallants , set .
Ay , fall to't , gentlemen .
I shall hear some news from some of you anon :
I 've th ' art to know which lose , and ne 'er look on .
I 'll be ready with all the worst money I can find about me.--
Arthur !
Here , sir .
Stand ready .
Fear not me , sir .
These are mine , sir .
Here 's a washed angel ;
It shall away : here 's Mistress Rose-noble
Has lost her maidenhead , crack 'd in the ring ;
She 's good enough for gamesters , and to pass
From man to man : for gold presents at dice
Your harlot , in one hour won and lost thrice ;
Every man has a fling at her .
Again ? Pax of these dice !
' Tis ill to curse the dead , sir .
TAILBY
Mew , where should I wish
The pox but among bones ?
He tells you right , sir .
I ne 'er have any luck at these odd hands ;
None here to make us six ? Why , Master Frip !
I am very well here , I thank you , sir : I had rather be telling
my money myself than have others count it for me ; 'tis the scurviest
music in the world , methinks , to hear my money gingle in other
men 's pockets ; I never had any mind to't , i'faith .
' Slud , play six or play four , I 'll play no more .
'Sfoot , you see there 's none here to draw in .
Rather than you should be destitute , gentlemen , I 'll play my ten
pound , if my master 's worship will give me leave .
Come .
He shall , he shall .
Pray , excuse me , gentlemen . 'Sfoot , how now ,
goodman rascal ? What , because you served my grandfather when
he went ambassador , and got some ten pound by th ' hand , has that
put such spirit in you to offer to draw in among gentlemen of
worship , knave ?
Pray , sir , let 's entreat so much for once .
' Tis a usual grace , i'faith , sir ; you 've many gentlemen will play
with their men .
Ay , and with their maids too , i'faith .
Good sir , give him leave .
Yes , come , and you be weary on't ; I pray draw near , sir .
Not so , sir .
Come , fool , fear nothing ; I warrant 't ye has given thee leave :
stand here by me . Come now , set round , gentlemen , set .
How the poor fellow shakes ! Throw lustily , man .
At all , gentlemen !
Well said , i'faith .
They 're all thine .
By my troth , I am glad the fellow has such luck , 'twill encourage
him well .
At my master 's worship alone !
Now , sir slave ?
At my master 's worship alone !
So , saucy rascal !
At my master 's worship alone !
You 're a rogue , and will be ever one .
By my troth , gentlemen , at all again for once .
Take 'em to thee , boy , take 'em to thee ; thou'rt worthy of 'em ,
i'faith .
Gentlemen , faith , I am angry with you : go and suborn my knave
again me here , to make him proud and peremptory !
Troth , that 's but your conceit , sir ; the fellow 's an honest fellow ,
and knows his duty , I dare swear for him .
Heart , I am sick already !
Whither goes Master Pursenet ?
Play on ; I 'll take my turn , sir . Boy !
Master ?
Pist ! A supply ; carry 't closely , my
little fooker . How much ?
Three pound , sir .
Good boy ! Take out another lesson.--How now , gentlemen ?
Devil 's in't , did you e 'er see such a hand ?
I set you these three angels .
My master may set high , for all his stakes are
drawn out of other men 's pockets .
As I said , gentlemen .
Deuce ace !
At all your right worshipful worships !
Death and vengeance !
Hell , darkness !
Hold , sir .
Master Goldstone--
Hinder me not , sweet gentlemen . You rascal ,
I banish thee the board .
I'faith , but you shall not , sir .
Touch a die , and thou darest ! Come you in with your lousy ten
pound , you slave , among gentlemen of worship , and win thirty at
a hand ?
Why , will you kick again luck , sir ?
As long as the poor fellow ventures the loss of his own money ,
who can be offended at his fortunes ?
I have a master here ! Many a gentleman would be glad to see his
man come forward , aha .
Pray , be persuaded , sir .
' Slife , here 's none cuts my throat in play but he ; I have observ 'd
it , an unlucky slave 'tis .
Methinks his luck 's good enough , sir .
Upon condition , gentlemen , that I may ever bar him from the board
hereafter , I am content to wink at him .
Faith , use your own pleasure hereafter ; h'as won our money now .
Come to th ' table , sir ; your master 's friends
with you .
Pray , gentlemen--
The fiend 's in't , I think : I left a fair chain of pearl at my
lodging , too , like an ass , and ne 'er remembered it ; that would
ha' been a good pawn now . Speak , what do
hat too , for I perceive 'tis dark enough already , and it does
but trouble me here .
Very well , sir ; why , now I can lend you three pound , sir .
Prithee , do 't quickly then .
There 'tis in six angels .
Very compendiously .
Here , Arthur , run away with these presently ; I 'll enter 'em into
th ' shopbook tomorrow .
" Item , one gilt hatch 'd rapier and dagger ,
with a fair embroidered girdle and hangers , with which came also
a beaver hat with a correspondent band . "
Push ! I'faith , sir , you 're to blame ; you have snibbed the poor
fellow too much ; he can scarce speak , he cleaves his words with
sobbing .
Haff , haff , haff , haff at all , gentlemen .
Ah , rogue , I 'll make you know yourself !
At the fairest !
Out , i'faith ! Two aces .
I am glad of that ; come , pay me all these , goodman cloak-bag .
Why , are you the fairest , sir ?
You need not doubt of that , sir.--Five angels , you scoundrel !
Fie a' these dice ! Not one hand tonight ! There they go , gentlemen ,
at all , i'faith !
Pay all with two treys and a quater .
All curses follow 'em ! Pay yourselves withal . I 'll pawn myself
to't , but I 'll see a hand tonight : not once hold in ! Here , Master
Frip , lend me you hand , quick , quick ; so .
What do you borrow of this doublet now ?
Ne 'er saw the world three days .
Go to ; in regard you 're a continual customer I 'll use you well ,
and pleasure you with five angels upon't .
Let me not stand too long i' th ' cold for them .
Had ever country gentleman such fortune ? All swoopt away ! I 'd
need repair to th ' broker 's .
If you be in that mind , sir , there sits a gentleman will furnish
you upon any pawn as well as the publickst broker of 'em all .
Say you so , sir ? There 's comfort in that , i'faith .
" Item , upon his orange-tawny satin doublet ,
five angels . "
But , by your leave , sir , next comes the breeches .
O , I have tongue fit for anything .
Saving your tale , sir ; 'tis given me to understand that you are
a gentleman i' th ' hundred , and deal in the premises aforesaid .
Master Bungler , Master Bungler , you 're mightily mistook : I am
content to do a gentleman a pleasure for once , so his pawn be
neat and sufficient .
Why , what say you to my grandfather 's seal-ring here ?
Ay , marry , sir , this is somewhat like .
Nay , view it well ; an ancient arms , I can tell you .
What 's this , sir ?
The great cod-piece , with nothing in't .
How !
The word about it ,
What 's that , I pray , sir ?
" You promise to mount us . "
And belike he was not so good as his word ?
So it should seem by the story , for so our names came to be Bunglers .
A lamentable hearing , that so great a house should shrink and
fall to ruin !
Two quaters , and yet lose it ? Heart ! Boy !
I'faith , what is't ?
Five pound , sir .
By my troth , this boy goes forward well ; ye shall
see him come to his preferment i' th ' end !
Why , how now ? Who 's that , gentlemen ? A bargeman ?
I never have any luck , gallants , till my doublet 's off ; I 'm not
half nimble enough at this , old cinque-quater drivel-beard .
FULK
Your worship must pay me all these , sir .
There , and feast the devil with 'em !
Hell gnaw these dice !
What , do you give over , gallants ?
Is't not time ?
I protest I have but one angel left to guide me home to my lodging .
How much , thinkest ?
Some fourscore angels , sir .
Peace , we 'll join powers anon , and see
how strong we are in the whole number . Mass , yon gilt goblet
stands so full in mine eye , the whoreson tempts me ; it comes like
cheese after a great feast , to disgest the rest : he will hardly
'scape me , i'faith , I see that by him already : back for a parting
blow now.--Boy !
Anon , anon , sir .
Fetch a pennyworth of soft wax to seal letters .
I will , sir .
Nay , had not I strange casting ? Thrice together two quaters and
a deuce !
Why , was not I as often haunted with two treys and a quater ?
There 's wax for your worship . Anon , anon ,
sir .
Screen me a little , you whoreson old cross-biter .
Why , what 's the business ? Filch
it on hob goblet ?
And what has Master Bouser lost ?
Faith , not very deeply , sir ; enough for a scholar , some half a
score royals .
'Sfoot , I have lost as many with spurs at their heels .
Come , gallants , shall we stumble ?
What 's a' clock ?
Here 's none on't , Dick ; the goblet 's carried down .
Nay , 'tis upon the point of three , boy .
SECOND DRAWER
What 's to be done , sirs ?
All 's paid , and your worships are welcome ; only there 's a goblet
missing , gentlemen , and cannot be found about house .
How , a goblet ?
What manner a' one ?
A gilt goblet , sir , of an indifferent size .
'Sfoot , I saw such a one lately .
It cannot be found now , sir .
Came there no strangers here ?
No, sir .
' Tis a marvellous matter , that a goblet should be gone , and
none but we in the room ; the loss is near all , here as we are ;
keep the door , vintner .
No, I beseech your worship .
By my troth , vintner , we 'll have a privy search for this . What ,
we are not all one woman 's children .
I beseech ye , gentlemen , have not that conceit of me , that I suspect
your worships .
Tut , you are an ass ; do you know every man 's nature ? There 's
a broker i' th ' company .
' Slife , you have not stole the goblet ,
boy , have you ?
Not I , sir .
I was afraid.--'Tis a good cause , i'faith ,
let each man search his fellow : we 'll begin with you .
I shall save somebody a labour , gentlemen , for I 'm half searched
already .
I thought the goblet had hung here , i'faith ; none here , nor here .
Seek about floor . What was the goblet worth , vintner ?
Three pound ten shillings , sir ; no more .
Pox on't , gentlemen , 'tis but angels apiece : it shall be a brace
of mine , rather than I would have our reputations breathed upon
by all comers ; for you must think they 'll talk on't in all companies--such
a night , in such a company , such a goblet : 'sfoot , it may grow
to a gangrene in our credits , and be incurable .
Faith , I am content .
So am I.
There 's my angel too .
So , and mine . I 'll tell thee what , the missing
of this goblet has dismayed the gentlemen much .
I am sorry for that , sir .
Yet they send thee this comfort by me ; if they see thee but rest
satisfied , and depart away contented , which will appear in thy
countenance , not three times thrice the worth of the goblet shall
hang between them and thee , both in their continual custom and
all their acquaintances .
I thank their worships all ; I am satisfied .
Say it again.--Do you hear , gentlemen ?
I thank your worships all ; I am satisfied .
Why , la , was not this better than hazarding our reputations upon
trifles , and in such public as a tavern , such a questionable place ?
True .
Faith , it was well thought on .
Nay , keep your way , gentlemen : I have sworn , Master Bouser , I
will be last , i'faith .
Rascal , the goblet !
Where , sir ?
Peep yon , sir , under .
Here , sir .
" My husband is rode from home : make no
delay ; I know , if your will be as free as your horse , you will
see me yet ere dinner . From Kingston , this eleventh of November . "
Hah ! These women are such creatures , such importunate , sweet
souls , they 'll scarce give a man leave to be ready ; that 's their
only fault , i'faith : if they be once set upon a thing , why , there 's
no removing of 'em , till their pretty wills be fulfilled . O ,
pity thy poor oppressed client here , sweet Cupid , that has scarce
six hours ' vacation in a month , his causes hang in so many courts ,
yet never suffer my French adversary , nor his big swoll 'n confederates ,
to overthrow me ,
Who without mercy would my blood carouse ,
And lay me in prison in a doctor 's house .
Thy clemency , great Cupid ! Peace , who comes here ?
Sir gallant , well encountered .
I both salute and take my leave together .
Why , whither so fast , sir ?
Excuse me , pray ;
I 'm in a little haste ; my horse waits for me .
What , some journey toward ?
A light one , i'faith , sir .
I 'm sorry that my business so commands me ,
I cannot ride with you ; but I make no question
You have company enough .
Alas , not any !
Nor do I desire it.--Why , 'tis but a Kingston
yonder .
O , cry you mercy , sir .
'Scape but one reach ,
There 's a little danger thither .
True , a little of Combe Park .
You 've nam 'd the place , sir ; that 's all I fear , i'faith .
Farewell , sweet Master Tailby .
This fell out happily ;
I 'll call this purchase mine before I greet him ;
E'en where his fear lies most , there will I meet him .
Boy .
Sir ?
Walk my horse behind yon thicket ; give a word if you descry .
I have all perfect , sir .
So ; he cannot now be long . What with my boy 's dexterity at ordinaries ,
and my gelding 's celerity over hedge and ditch , but we make pretty
shift to rub out a gallant ; for I have learnt these principles :
Stoop thou to th ' world , 'twill on thy bosom tread ;
It stoops to thee , if thou advance thy head .
The mind being far more excellent than fate ,
' Tis fit our mind then be above our state .
Why should I write my extremities in my brow ,
To make them loathe me that respect me now ?
If every man were in his courses known ,
Legs that now honour him might spurn him down .
To conclude , nothing seems as it is but honesty , and that makes
it so little regarded amongst us .
Ela , ha , ho!
The boy ? He 's hard at hand ;
I 'll cross him suddenly : and here he comes .
Stand !
Ha !
Deliver your purse , sir .
I feared none but this place , i'faith ; nay , when my mind gives
me a thing once--
Quick , quick , sir , quick ; I must despatch three robberies yet
ere night .
I 'm glad you have such good doings , by my troth , sir .
You 'll fare ne 'er a whit the better for your flattery , I warrant
you , sir .
I speak sincerely ; 'tis pity such a proper-parted gentleman should
want ; nor shall you , as long as I have 't about me .
Nay , search and spare not : there 's a purse in my left pocket ,
as I take it , with fifteen pound in gold in't , and there 's a fair
chain of pearl in the other : nay , I 'll deal truly you ; it grieves
me , i'faith , when I see such goodly men in distress ; I 'll rather
want it myself than they should go without it .
And that shows a good nature , sir .
Nay , though I say it , I have been always counted a man of a good
nature ;
I might have hanged myself ere this time else .
Pray , use me like a gentleman ; take all ,
But injury not my body .
You must pardon me , sir ;
I must a little play the usurer ,
And bind you , for mine own security .
Alas ! There 's no conscience in that , sir ! Shall
I enter into bond and pay money too ?
Tut , I must not be betrayed .
Hear me but what
I say , sir ; I do protest I would not be he
That should betray a man , to be prince of the world .
Mass , that 's the devil--l thank you heartily--
For he 's call 'd prince a' th ' world .
You take me still at worst .
Swear on this sword then ,
To set spurs to your horse , not to look back ,
To give no marks to any passenger .
Marks ? Why , I think you have left me ne 'er a penny , sir .
I mean , no marks of me .
I understand you , sir .
Swear then .
I'faith , I do , sir .
Away !
I 'm gone , sir . By my troth , of a fierce thief
he seems to be a very honest gentleman .
Why , this was well adventur 'd , trim a gallant !
Now , with a courteous and long-thirsting eye ,
Let me behold my purchase ,
And try the soundness of my bones with laughter .
How ? Is not this the chain of pearl I gave
To that perjured harlot ? ' Tis , 'sfoot , 'tis ,
The very chain ! O damned mistress ! Ha !
And this the purse which , not five days before ,
I sent her filled with fair spur-royals ? Heart ,
The very gold ! ' Slife , is this no robbery ?
How many oaths flew toward heaven ,
Which ne 'er came half-way thither , but , like firedrakes ,
Mounted a little , gave a crack , and fell :
Feign 'd oaths bound up to sink more deep to hell .
What folded paper 's this ? Death , 'tis her hand !
" Master Tailby , you know with what affection
I love you . " You do ? " I count the world but as my
prey to maintain you . " The more dissembling quean you , I
must tell you . " I have sent you an embroidered purse here
with fifty fair spur-royals in't . " A pox on you for your
labour , wench ! " And I desire you of all loves to keep that
chain of pearl from Master Pursenet 's sight . " He cannot ,
strumpet ; I behold it now , unto thy secret torture . " So
fare thee well , but be constant and want nothing"--as long
as I ha't , i'faith , methinks it should have gone so . Well , what
a horrible age do we live in , that a man cannot have a quean to
himself ! Let him but turn his back , the best of her is chipp 'd
away like a court loaf , that when a man comes himself , has nothing
but bumbast ; and these are two simple chippings here . Does my
boy pick and I steal to enrich myself , to keep her , to maintain
him ? Why , this is right the sequence of the world . A lord maintains
her , she maintains a knight , he maintains a whore , she maintains
a captain . So in like manner the pocket keeps my boy , he keeps
me , I keep her , she keeps him ; it runs like quicksilver from one
to another . 'Sfoot , I perceive I have been the chief upholder
of this gallant all this while : it appears true , we that pay dearest
for our pasture are ever likely worse used . 'Sfoot , he has a
nag can run for nothing , has his choice , nay , and gets by the
running of her . O fine world , strange devils , and pretty damnable
affections !
Lela , ha , ho!
There , boy , again : what news there ?
Master , pist , master !
How now , boy ?
I have descried a prize .
Another , lad ?
The gull , the scholar .
Master Bouser ?
Ay ;
Comes along this way .
Without company ?
As sure as he is your own .
Back to thy place , boy .
I have the luck today to rob in safety ;
Two precious cowards ! Whist ; I hear him .
Stand !
You lie ; I came forth to go .
Deliver your purse .
' Tis better in my pocket .
How now ? At disputations , signior fool ?
I 've so much logic to confute a knave ,
A thief , a rogue !
Hold , hold , sir , and you be
A gentleman , hold ! Let me rise .
Heart !
' Tis the courtesy of his scarf unmask 'd him to me
Above the lip by chance : I 'll counterfeit.--
Light ,
Because I am a scholar , you think belike
That scholars have no metal in 'em , but you
Shall find I have not done with you , cousin .
As you 're a gentleman !
As you 're a rogue !
Keep on upon your way , sir .
You bade me stand--
I have been once down for that .
And then deliver .
Deliver me from you , sir !
O , pax on't , has wounded me !
Ela , ha , ho : my horse , my horse , boy !
Have you your boy so ready ? O thou world ,
How art thou muffled in deceitful forms !
There 's such a mist of these , and still hath been ,
The brightness of true gentry is scarce seen .
This journey was most happily assign 'd ;
I 've found him dross both in his means and mind .
What paper 's this he dropp 'd ? I 'll look on't as I go .
A gull call you him ? Let me always set upon wise men ; they 'll
be afraid of their lives ; they have a feeling of their iniquities ,
and know what 'tis to die with fighting : 'sfoot , this gull lays
on without fear or wit . How deep 's it , sayst thou , boy ?
By my faith , three inches , sir .
La , this was long of you , you rogue !
Of me , sir ?
Forgive me , dear boy ; my wound ached , and I grew angry : there 's
hope of life , boy , is there not ?
Pooh , my life for yours !
A comfortable boy in man 's extremes ! I was ne 'er so afraid in
my life but the fool would have seen my face : he had me at such
advantage , he might have commanded my scarf . I 'scaped well there ;
't 'ad choked me ; my reputation had been past recovery : yet live
I unsuspected , and still fit for gallant 's choice societies .
But here I vow , if e 'er I see this Bouser when he cannot see me ,
either in by-lane , privileged place , court , alley or come behind
him when he 's standing ,
Or take him when he reels from a tavern late ,
Pissing again a conduit , wall , or gate ;
When he 's in such a plight , and clear from men ,
I 'll do that I 'm ashamed to speak till then .
Nay , read forward . I have found three of your gallants , like
your bewitching shame , merely sophistical : there 's your bawd-gallant ,
your pocket-gallant , and your whore-gallant .
" Master Tailby--"
That 's he .
" I count the world but as my prey to maintain
you . "
That 's just the phrase and style of 'em all to him ; they meet
altogether in one effect , and it may well hold , too , for they
all jump upon one cause , lechery .
What shapes can flattery take ! Let me entreat you ,
Both in the virgin 's right and our good hopes ,
Since your hours are so fortunate , to proceed .
Why , he 's base that fares until he crown his deed .
See that dissembling devil , that perjur 'd strumpet !
Welcome , my soul 's best wish . O , out , alas !
Thy arm bound in a scarf ? I shall swoon instantly .
Heart , and I 'll fetch you again in the same tune .
O my unmatch 'd love , if any spark of life remain ,
Look up , my comfort , my delight , my--
O good , O good !
The organ of her voice is tun 'd again ;
There 's hope in women when their speech returns ;
See , like the moon after a black eclipse ,
She by degrees recovers her pure light .
How cheers my love ?
As one new-wak 'd out of a deadly trance ,
The fit scarce quiet .
' Twas terrible for the time ;
I 'd much ado to fetch you .
' Shrew your fingers!--
How came my comfort wounded ? Speak .
Faith , in a fray last night .
In a fray ? Will you lose your blood so vainly ?
Many a poor creature lacks it . Tell me , how ?
What was the quarrel ?
Loath to tell you that .
Loath to tell me ?
Yet 'twas my cause of coming .
Why , then , must not I know it ?
Since you urge it ,
You shall : you 're a strumpet !
O , news abroad , sir !
Say you so ?
Why , you knew that the first night you lay with me .
Nay , not to me only , but to the world .
Speak within compass , man .
Faith , you know none ,
You sail without .
I have the better skill then .
At my first step into a tavern-room , to spy
That chain of pearl wound on a stranger 's arm
You begg 'd of me !
How ? You mistook it sure .
By heaven , the very self-same chain !
O , cry you mercy , 'tis true , I 'd forgot it : 'tis Saint George 's
day tomorrow : I lent it to my cousin only to grace his arm before
his mistress .
Notable cunning !
And is this all now , i'faith ?
Not ; I durst go further .
Why , let me never possess your love if you see not that again
a' Thursday morning : I take 't unkindly , i'faith , you should fall
out with me for such a trifle .
Better and better !
Come , a kiss , and friends !
Away !
By this hand , I 'll spoil your arm and you will not .
More for this than the devil--
Yea , at your book so hard ?
Against my will . Are you there , Signior Logic ?
A pox of you , sir !
Why , how now ? What has fate sent us here , in the name of Venus ,
goddess of Cyprus ?
A freebooter 's pink , sir , three or four inches deep .
No more ? That 's conscionable , i'faith .
Troth , I 'm sorry for't : pray , how came it , sir ?
Faith , by a paltry fray , in Coleman Street .
Combe Park , he would say .
No less than three at once , sir ,
Made a triangle with their swords and daggers ,
And all opposing me .
And amongst those three only one hurt you , sir ?
Ex for ex .
Troth , and I 'll tell you what luck I had too , since I parted from
you last .
What , I pray ?
The day you offered to ride with me , I wish now I 'd had your company :
'sfoot , I was set upon in Combe Park by three too .
Bah !
Robbed , by this light , of as much gold and jewels as I value at
forty pound .
Sure Saturn is in the fifth house .
I know not that ; he may be in the sixth and he will for me : I
am sure they were in my pocket wheresoever they are ; but I 'll
ne 'er refuse a gentleman 's company again when 'tis offered me ,
I warrant you .
I must remember you 'tis Mitre-night , ladies .
Mass , 'tis indeed Friday today , I 'd quite forgot : when a woman 's
busy , how the time runs away !
O , you 've betrayed us both !
I understand you not .
You 've let him see the chain of pearl I gave you .
Who ? Him ? Will you believe me , by this hand ,
He never saw it .
Upon a stranger 's arm he swore to me .
Mass , that may be ; for the truth is , i'faith ,
I was robb 'd on't at Combe Park .
' Twas that betrayed it .
I would I had stay 'd him ;
He was no stranger , he was a thief , i'faith ,
For thieves will be no strangers .
How shall I excuse it ?
Nay , I have you fast enough , boy ; you rogue !
Good sir , I beseech you , sir , let me go !
A pickpocket ! Nay , you shall to Newgate , look you .
Is this your boy , sir ?
How now , boy ? A monster ? Thy arm lined fast in another 's pocket ?
Where learnt you that manners ? What company have you kept a'
late , that you are so transformed into a rogue ? That shape I
know not . Believe me , sir , I much wonder at the alteration of
this boy , where he should get this nature : as good a child to
see to , and as virtuous ; he has his creed by heart , reads me his
chapter duly every night ; he will not miss you one tittle in the
nine commandments .
There 's ten of 'em .
I fear he skips o 'er one , " Thou shalt not steal . "
Mass , like enough .
Else grace and memory would quite abash the boy .
Thou graceless imp ! Ah , thou prodigious child ,
Begot at some eclipse , degenerate rogue ,
Shame to thy friends , and to thy master eke !
How far digressing from the noble mind
Of thy brave ancestors , that lie in marble
With their coat-armours o 'er 'em !
Had he such friends ?
The boy is well descended , though he be a rogue , and has no feeling
on't ; yet for my sake , and for my reputation 's , seek not the blood
of the boy ; he 's near allied to many men of worship now yet living ;
a fine old man to his father ; it would kill his heart , i'faith ;
he 'd away like a chrisom .
Alas , good gentleman !
Ah , shameless villain ,
Complain 'st thou ? Dost thou want ?
No, no , no , no!
Art not well clad ? Thy hunger well resisted ?
Yes , yes , yes , yes !
But thou shall straight to Bridewell .
Sweet master !
Live upon bread and water and chap-choke .
I beseech your worship !
Come , I 'll be his surety for once .
You shall excuse me indeed , sir .
He will mend : 'a may prove an honest man for all this . I know
gallant gentlemen now that have done as much as this comes to
in their youth .
Say you so , sir ?
And as for Bridewell , that will but make him worse ; 'a will learn
more knavery there in one week than will furnish him and his heirs
for a hundred year .
Deliver the boy !
Nay , I tell you true , sir ; there 's none goes in there a quean ,
but she comes out an arrant whore , I warrant you .
The boy comes not there for a million !
No, you had better forgive him by ten parts .
True ; but 'a must not know it comes from me .
Down a' your knees , you rogue ,
And thank this gentleman has got your pardon .
O , I thank your worship !
A pox on you for a rogue ;
You put me to my set speech once a quarter .
Nay , gentlemen , you quite forget your hour ; lead , Master Bouser .
Let me go : you 're a dissembler .
How ?
Did not you promise me a new gown ?
Let me see for the colour now : orange-tawny , peach colour . What
sayst to a watchet satin ?
O , 'tis the only colour I affect !
A very orient colour , an't please your worships . l made a gown
on't for a gentlewoman t 'other day , and it does passing well upon
her .
A watchet satin gown--
There your worship left , sir .
Laid about , tailor .
Very good , sir .
With four fair laces .
That will be costly , sir .
How , you rogue , costly ? Out a' th ' house , you slipshod , sham-legged ,
brown-thread-penny-skeined rascal !
Nay , my sweet love--
Hang him , rogue ! He 's but a botcher neither : come , I 'll send
thee a fellow worth a hundred of this , if the slave were clean
enough .
Who knocks ?
A Christian : pray , is not this Master Tailby 's lodging ? I was
directed hither .
Yes , this is my master 's lodging .
Cry you mercy , sir : is he yet stirring ?
He 's awake , but not yet stirring , for he played away half his
clothes last night .
My mistress commends her secrets unto him , and presents him by
me with a new satin suit here .
Mass , that comes happily .
And she hopes the fashion will content him .
There 's no doubt to be had of that , sir : your mistress 's name ,
pray ?
You 're much preciously welcome .
I thank you uncommonly , sir .
The suit shall be accepted , I warrant you , sir .
That 's all my mistress desires , sir .
Fare you well , sir .
Fare you well , sir .
This will make my master leap out of the bed for joy , and dance
Wigmore 's galliard in his shirt about the chamber !
Came this suit from Mistress Cleveland ?
She sent it secretly , sir .
A pretty requiteful squall ! I like that woman that can remember
a good turn three months after the date ; it shows both a good
memory and a very feeling spirit .
This came fortunately , sir , after all your ill luck last night .
I 'd beastly casting , Jack .
O abominable , sir ! You had the scurviest hand ; the old serving-man
swooped up all .
I am glad the fortune lighted upon the poor fellow , by my troth ;
it made his master mad .
Did you mark that , sir ? I warrant he has the doggedest master
of any poor fellow under the dog-sign : I 'd rather serve your worship ,
I 'll say that behind your back , sir , for nothing , as indeed I
have no standing wages at all , your worship knows .
O , but your vails , Jack , your vails considered , when you run to
and fro between me and mistresses--
I must confess my vails are able to keep an honest man , go I where
I list .
Go to then , Jack .
But those vails stand with the state of your body , sir , as long
as you hold up your head : if that droop once , farewell you , farewell
I , farewell all ; and droop it will , though all the caudles in
Europe should put to their helping hands to't : 'tis e 'en as uncertain
as playing , now up and now down ; for if the bill down rise to
above thirty , here 's no place for players ; so if your years rise
to above forty , there 's no room for old lechers .
And that 's the reason all rooms are taken up for young templars .
You 're in the right , sir .
Pize on't , I pawned a good beaver hat to Master Frip last night ,
Jack : I feel the want of it now .
Hark , who 's that knocks ?
Is Master Tailby stirring ?
What 's your pleasure with him ? He walks here i' th ' hall .
Give your worship good morrow .
Welcome , honest lad .
A letter from my mistress .
Who 's thy mistress ?
Mistress Newblock .
Mistress Newblock , my sincere love ; how does she ?
Faith , only ill in the want of your sight .
Alas , dear sweet ! I 've had such business , I protest I ne 'er stood
still since I saw her .
She has sent your worship a beaver hat here , with a band best
in fashion .
How shall I requite this dear soul ?
' Tis not a thing fit for me to tell you , sir , for I have three
years to serve yet : your worship knows how , I warrant you .
I know the drift of her letter ; and for the beaver , say I accept
it highly .
O , she will be a proud woman of that , sir !
And hark thee ; tell thy mistress , as I 'm a gentleman , I 'll despatch
her out of hand the first thing I do , a' my credit : canst thou
remember these words now ?
Yes , sir ; as you are a gentleman , you 'll despatch her out of hand
the first thing you do .
Ay , a' my credit .
O , of your credit ; I thought not of that , sir .
Remember that , good boy .
Fear it not now , sir .
I dreamt tonight , Jack , I should have a secret supply out a' th '
city .
Your dream crawls out partly well , sir .
What news there now ?
I have an errand to Master Tailby .
Yonder walks my master .
Mistress Tiffany commends her to your worship , and has sent you
your ten pound in gold back again , and says she cannot furnish
you of the same lawn you desire till after Allhollandtide .
Thank her she would let me understand so much .
Ha , ha !
This wench will live : why , this was sent like a
Workwoman now ; the rest are botchers to her .
Faith , I commend her cunning : she 's a fool
That makes her servant fellow to her heart ;
It robs her of respect , dams up all duty ,
Keeps her in awe e 'en of the slave she keeps :
This takes a wise course--I commend her more--
Sends back the gold I never saw before .
Well , women are my best friends still , i'faith .
Take lands : give me
Good legs , firm back , white hand , black eye , brown hair ,
And add but to these five a comely stature ;
Let others live by art , and I by nature .
Master Bouser , Master Bouser ! Ha , ha , ho! Master Bouser !
Holla !
What , not out of thy kennel , Master Bouser ?
Master Goldstone ? You 're an early gallant , sir .
A fair cloak yonder , i'faith.--By my troth , a-bed ,
Master Bouser ? You remember your promise well o 'ernight !
Why , what 's a' clock , sir ?
Do you ask that now ? Why , the chimes are spent at Saint Bride 's .
' Tis a gentleman 's hour : faith , Master Goldstone ,
I 'll be ready in a trice .
Away , there 's no trust to you .
Faith , I 'll come instantly .
Nay , choose whether you will or no , by my troth ,
your cloak shall go before you .
Nay , Master Goldstone , I ha' sworn : do you hear ,
sir ?
Away , away ! Faith , I 'm angry with you : pox , a-bed now ! I 'm ashamed
of it .
Foot , my cloak , my cloak , Master Goldstone ! ' Slife , what mean
you by this , sir ? You 'll bring it back again , I hope . No ? Not
yet ? By my troth , I care very little for such kind of jesting :
methinks this familiarity now extends a little too far , unless
it be a new fashion come forth this morning secretly ; yesterday
'twould have shown unmannerly and saucily . I scarce know yet
what to think on't . Well , there 's no great profit in standing
in my shirt , I 'll on with my clothes : h'as bound me to follow
the suit : my cloak 's a stranger ; he was made but yesterday , and
I do not love to trust him alone in company .
What may I conjecture of this Goldstone ? He has not only pawned
to me this cloak , but the very diamond and sapphire which I bestowed
upon my new love at Master Primero 's house : the cloak 's new , and
comes fitly to do me great grace at a wedding this morning , to
which I was solemnly invited . I can continue change more than
the proudest gallant of 'em all , yet never bestow penny of myself ,
my pawns do so kindly furnish me : but the sight of these jewels
is able to cloy me , did I not preserve my stomach the better for
the wedding-dinner . A gift could never have come in a more patient
hour , nor to be better disgested . Is she proved false ? But I 'll
not fret today nor chafe my blood .
Frippery I owe you for a pink three inches deep , sir .
Take that in part of payment for Combe Park .
How now , who 's this ? 'Sfoot , one of our gallants knocked down
like a calf ! Is there such a plague of 'em here at London , they
begin to knock 'em a' th ' head already ?
O Master Bouser ! Pray , lend me your hand , sir ; I am slain !
Slain and alive ? O cruel execution !
What man so savage-spirited durst presume
To strike down satin on two taffetas cut ,
Or lift his hand against a beaver hat ?
Some rogue that owes me money , and had no other means . To a wedding-dinner !
I must be dressed myself , methinks .
How ? Why , this is my cloak : life , how came my cloak hither ?
Is it yours , sir ? Master Goldstone pawned it to me this morning
fresh and fasting , and borrowed five pound upon't .
How , pawned it ? Pray , let me hear out this story : come , and I 'll
lead you to the next barber-surgeon 's . Pawned my cloak ?
How now , Marmaduke ? What 's the wager ?
Nay , my care is at end , sir , now I am come to the sight of you .
My mistress , your cousin , entreats you to take part of a dinner
with her at home at her house , and bring what gentleman you please
to accompany you .
Thank my sweet coz : I 'll munch with her , say .
I 'll tell her so .
Marmaduke--
Sir ?
Will there be any stockfish , thinkest thou ?
How , sir ?
Tell my coz I 've a great appetite to stockfish , i'faith .
Master Goldstone , I 'll entreat you to be the gentleman that shall
accompany me .
Not me , sir ?
You , sir .
GOLDSTONE
By my troth , concluded . What state bears thy coz , sirrah ?
O , a fine merchant 's wife .
Or rather , a merchant 's fine wife .
Trust me , and that 's the properer phrase here at London ; and 'tis
as absurd too to call him fine merchant , for , being at sea , a
man knows not what pickle he is in .
Why , true .
Yet my coz will be served in plate , I can tell you ; she has her
silver jugs and her gilt tankards .
Fie !
Nay , you shall see a house dressed up , i'faith ; you must not think
to tread a' th ' ground when you come there .
No ? How then ?
Why , upon paths made of fig-frails and white blankets cut out
in steaks .
Away ! I have thought of a device.--Where shall
we meet an hour hence ?
In Paul 's .
Agreed .
The broker-gallant and the cheating-gallant :
Now I have found 'em all , I so rejoice ,
That the redeeming of my cloak I weigh not .
I have spied him .
Pax , here 's Bouser .
Master Goldstone , my cloak ! Come , where 's my cloak , sir ?
O , you 're a sure gentleman , especially if a man stand in need
of you ! He may be slain in a morning to breakfast ere you vouchsafe
to peep out of your lodging .
How ?
No less than four gallants , as I 'm a gentleman , drew all upon
me at once , and opposed me so spitefully , that I not only lost
your cloak i' th ' fray--
Comes it in there ?
But my rich hangers , sirrah ; l think thou hast seen 'em .
Never , i'faith , sir .
Those with the two unicorns , all wrought in pearl and gold : pox
on't , it frets me ten times more than the loss of the paltry cloak :
prithee , and thou lovest me , speak no more on't ; it brings the
unicorns into my mind , and thou wouldst not think how the conceit
grieves me . I will not do thee that disgrace , i'faith , to offer
thee any satisfaction , for in my soul I think thou scornest it ;
thou bearest that mind , in my conscience ; I have always said so
of thee . Fare thee well : when shall I see thee at my chamber ,
when ?
Every day , shortly .
I have fine toys to show thee .
You win my heart then .
The devil scarce knew what a portion he gave his children when
he allowed 'em large impudence to live upon , and so turned 'em
into th ' world : surely he gave away the third part of the riches
of his kingdom ; revenues are but fools to't .
The filed tongue and the undaunted forehead
Are mighty patrimonies , wealthier than those
The city-sire or the court-father leaves :
In these behold it : riches oft , like slaves ,
Revolt ; they bear their foreheads to their graves .
What soonest grasps advancement , mends great suits ,
Trips down rich widows , gains repute and name ,
Makes way where 'er it comes , bewitches all ?
Thou , Impudence , the minion of our days ,
On whose pale cheeks favour and fortune plays .
Call you these your five gallants ?
Trust me , they 're rare fellows :
They live on nothing ; many cannot live on something :
Here they may take example . Suspectless virgin ,
How easy had thy goodness been beguil 'd !
Now only rests , that as to me they 're known
So to the world their base arts may be shown .
Art sure thou sawest him receive 't , boy ?
Forty pound in gold , as I 'm a gentleman born .
Thy father gave the ram 's head , boy ?
No, you 're deceiv 'd ; my mother gave that , sir .
What 's thy mother 's is thy father 's .
I 'm sorry it holds in the ram 's head . See , here he walks ; I was
sure he came into Paul 's : the gold had been yours , master , long
ere this , but that he wears both his hands in his pockets .
How unfortunately is my purpose seated ! What the devil should
come in his mind to keep in his hands so long ? The biting but
of a paltry louse would do me great kindness now ; I 'd know not
how to requite it : will no rascal creature assist me ? Stay , what
if I did impudently salute 'em out ? Good . Boy , be ready , boy .
Upon the least advantage , sir .
You 're most devoutly met in Paul 's , sir .
So are you , but I scarce remember you , sir .
O , I cry you mercy , sir ; I pray , pardon me ; I fear I have tendered
an offence , sir : troth , I took you at the first for one Master
Dumpling , a Norfolk gentleman .
There 's no harm done yet , sir .
I hope he is there by this time.--How now , boy ,
hast it ?
No, by troth , have I not ; this labour 's lost : 'tis in the right
pocket , and he kept that hand in sure enough .
Unpractised gallant ! Salute me but with one hand ,
Like a counterfeit soldier ? O times and manners !
Are we grown beasts ? Do we salute by halves ?
Are not our limbs at leisure ? Where 's comely nurture ?
The Italian kiss , or the French cringe ,
With the Polonian waist ? Are all forgot ?
Then misery follows . Surely fate forbade it :
Had he employ 'd but his right hand , I 'd had it .
It must be an everlasting device , I think , that procures both
his hands out at once .
Exit with Boy .
Do you walk , sir ?
No, I stay a little for a gentleman 's coming , too .
Farewell then , sir : I have forty pound in gold about me , which
I must presently send down into the country .
Fare you well , sir .
I wonder Master Goldstone spares my company so long ; 'tis now
about the navel of the day , upon the belly of noon .
See where he walks : be sure you let off
at a twinkling , now .
When did I miss you?--Your worship
has forgot you promised Mistress Newcut , your cousin , to dine
with her this day .
Mass , that was well remembered .
I am bold to salute you , sir .
Sir ?
Is Mistress Newcut your cousin , sir ?
Yes , she 's a cousin of mine , sir .
Then I am a cousin of yours , by the sister 's side .
Let me salute you then ; I shall be glad of your farther acquaintance .
I am a bidden guest there too .
Indeed , sir !
Faith , invited this morning .
Your good company shall be kindly embraced , sir .
I walk a turn or two here for a gentleman , but I think he 'll either
overtake me , or be before me .
' Tis very likely , sir . There , sirrah , go to
dinner and about two wait for me .
Nay , let him come between two and three , cousin , for we love to
sit long at dinner i' th ' city .
Come , sweet cousin .
Nay , cousin ; keep your way , cousin ; good cousin , I will not , i'faith ,
cousin .
Why , how now , sirrah ? Upon twelve of the clock , and not the cloth
laid yet ? Must we needs keep Exchange time still ?
I am about it , forsooth .
You 're about it , forsooth ? You 're still about many things , but
you ne 'er do one well . I am an ass to keep thee in th ' house ,
now my husband 's at sea ; thou hast no audacity with thee ; a foolish ,
dreaming lad , fitter to be in the garret than in any place else ;
no grace nor manly behaviour : when didst thou ever come to me
but with thy head hanging down ? O decheerful 'prentice , uncomfortable
servant !
Pray heaven the gull , my cousin , has so much wit left as to bring
Master Tailby along with him--my comfort , my delight!--for that
was the chiefest cause I did invite him . I bade him bring what
gentleman he pleased to accompany him ; as far as I durst go : why
may he not then make choice of Master Tailby ? Had he my wit or
feeling he would do 't .
Where 's my sweet cousin here ? Does she lack any guests ?
Ever such guess as you : you 're welcome , cousin .
I am rude , lady .
You 're most welcome , sir .
There will be a gallant here anon , coz ; he promised faithfully .
Who is't ? Master Tailby ?
Master Tailby ? No, Master Goldstone .
Master Goldstone ? I could think well of that Goldstone were 't
not for one vild trick he has .
What 's that , lady ?
In jest he will pawn his punks for supper .
That 's a vild part in him , i'faith , and he my were brother .
Pray , gentlemen , sit awhile ; your dinner shall come presently .
Yes , Mistress Newcut ? At first give me a trip ?
A close bite always asks a secret nip .
My cousin here is a very kind-natured soul , i'faith , in her humour .
Pooh , you know her not so well as I , coz ; I have observed her
in all her humours ; you ne 'er saw her a little waspish , I think .
I have not , i'faith .
Pooh , then ye ne 'er saw pretty humour in your life ; I can bring
her into't when I list .
Would you could , i'faith !
Would I could ? By my troth , and I were sure thou couldst keep
thy countenance , coz , what a pretty jest have I thought upon already
to entertain time dinner !
Prithee , coz , what is't ? I love a jest a' life , i'faith .
Ah , but I am jealous you will not keep your countenance , i'faith !
Why , ye shall see a pretty story of a humour . Faith , I 'll try
you for once : you know my cousin will wonder when she comes in
to see the cloth laid , and ne 'er a salt upon the board .
That 's true , i'faith .
Now will I stand a while out of sight with it , and give her humour
play a little .
Coz , dost thou love me ? And thou wilt ever do anything for me ,
do 't .
Marry , I build upon your countenance .
Why , dost thou think I 'm an ass , coz ?
I would be loath to undertake it else ; for if you should burst
out presently , coz , the jest would be spoiled .
Why , do not I know that ? Away , stand close !
So , so ; mum , cousin . A merry companion , i'faith : here will be
good sport anon . Whist , she comes .
I make you stay long for a bad dinner here , cousin ; if Master
Goldstone were come , the meat 's e 'en ready .
Some great business detains him , cousin , but he 'll not be long
now .
Why , how now ? Cuds my life !
Why--
Was ever mistress so plagued with a shuttle-headed servant ! Why ,
Marmaduke !
I come , forsooth .
Able to shame me from generation to generation !
Did you call , forsooth ?
Come hither , forsooth : did you lay this cloth ?
Yes , forsooth .
Do you use to lay a cloth without a salt , a salt , a salt , a salt ,
a salt , a salt !
How many salts would you have ? I 'm sure I set the best I ' the
house upon the board .
How , cousin ? " Cousin , cousin , did call ,
coz ? "
Did you see a salt upon the board when you came in ?
Pooh !
Come , come , I thought as much ; beshrew your fingers , where is't
now ?
Your cousin yonder--
Why , the man 's mad !
Cousin , hist , cousin !
What say you ?
Pooh , I call not you , I call my cousin . Come forth with the salt ,
cousin ! Ha ! How ? Nobody ? Why , was not he that came in e 'en
now your cousin ?
My cousin ? O my bell-salt , O my great bell-salt !
The tenor bell-salt . O , here comes Master Goldstone now , cousin ;
he may tell us some news on him . Did you
not meet a fellow about door with a great silver salt under his
arm ?
No, sure ; I met none such .
Pardon me , sir , I forgot all this while to bid you welcome . I
shall loath this room for ever . Take hence the cloth , you unlucky ,
maple-faced rascal ! Come , you shall dine in my chamber , sir .
No better place , lady .
No less than forty pound in fair gold at one lift ! The next shall
swoon and swoon again till the devil fetch him , ere I set hand
to him . Heart , nothing vexes me so much , but that I paid the
goldsmith for the change too not an hour before : had I let it
alone in the chain of silver as it was at first , it might have
given me some notice at his departure : 'sfoot , I could fight with
a windmill now . Sure 'twas some unlucky villain : why should he
come and salute me wrongfully too , mistake me at noonday ? Now
I think on't in cold blood , it could not be but an induction to
some villainous purpose : well , I shall meet him--
This forty pound came fortunately to redeem my chain of pearl
from mortgage : I would not care how often I swooned to have such
a good caudle to comfort me ; gold and pearl is very restorative .
See , yonder 's the rogue I suspect for foul play ! I 'll walk muffled
by him , offer some offence or cause of a quarrel , only to try
his temper ; if he be a coward , he 's the likelier to be a rogue ,
an infallible note .
What a pox ail you , sir ? Would I had been aware of you !
Sir , speak you to me ?
Not I , sir : pray , keep on your way ; I have nothing to say to you .
You 're a rascal !
You may say your pleasure , sir ; but I hope I go not like a rascal .
Are you fain to fly to your clothes because you 're gallant ? Why ,
there 's no rascal like your gallant rascal , believe that .
You have took me at such an hour , faith , you may call me e 'en
what you please ; nothing will move me .
No ? I 'll make somewhat move you . Draw ! I suspected you were
a rogue , and you have purs 'd it up well with a coward !
Who , my patron ?
Keep out , you rascal !
The guest that did me the kindness in Paul 's ? Hold , as you are
a gentleman ; you 'll give me breath , sir ?
Are you there with me ? A vengeance stop you ! You have found
breath enough to run away from me . I will never meet this slave
hereafter in a morning , but I will breathe myself upon him ; since
I can have no other satisfaction , he shall save me that forty
pound in fence-school .
When things are cleanly carried , sign of judgment :
I was the welcom 'st gallant to her alive
After the salt was stolen ; then a good dinner ,
A fine provoking meal , which drew on apace
The pleasure of a day-bed , and I had it ;
This here one ring can witness : when I parted ,
Who but " sweet Master Goldstone ? "
I left her in that trance . What cannot wit ,
So it be impudent , devise and compass ?
I 'd fain know that fellow now
That would suspect me but for what I am ;
He lives not : 'tis all in the conveyance .
What , thou look 'st not like a beggar :
What mask 'st thou on the ground ?
I 've a hand to help thee up : a fair chain of pearl !
Surely a merchant 's wife gives lucky handsel :
They that find pearl may wear't at a cheap rate ;
Marry , my lady dropp 'd it from her arm
For a device to tole me to her bed :
I 've seen as great a matter . Who be these ?
I 'll be too crafty for you .
O Monsieur Primero , Signior Frip ; is it you , gallants ?
Sweet Master Goldstone !
Every bawd exceeds me in fortune : Master Primero was robbed of
a carkanet upon Monday last ; laid the goldsmiths , and found it .
I ha' laid goldsmith , jeweller , burnisher , broker , and the
devil and all , I think , yet could never so much as hear of that
chain of pearl : he was a notable thief ; he works close . Peace ,
who be these ? Ha , let me see . By this light , there it is ! Back ,
lest they see thee : a happy minute ! Goldstone ? What an age do
we breathe in ! Who that saw him now would think he were maintained
by purses ? So , who that meets me would think I were maintained
by wenches ? As far as I can see , 'tis all one case , and holds
both in one court ; we are both maintained by the common roadway !
Keep thou thine own heart , thou livest unsuspected . I leese
you again now .
But , I pray you , tell me , met you no gentlewomen by the way you
came ?
Not any : what should they be ?
Nay , I do but ask , because a gentlewoman 's glove was found near
to the place I met you .
Faith , we saw none , sir .
Good officers , upon suspicion of felony .
Very good , sir .
What call you the thief 's name you do suspect ?
Master Justinian Goldstone .
Remember , Master Justinian Goldstone ; a terrible world the whilst ,
my masters !
Look you , that 's he : upon him , officers !
I see him not yet ; which is he , sir ?
Why , that .
He a thief , sir ? Who , that gentleman i' th ' satin ?
E'en he .
Farewell , sir ; you 're a merry gentleman .
As you will answer it , officers ! I 'll bear you out , I 'll be your
warrant .
Nay , and you say so . What 's his name then ?
Justinian Goldstone .
Master Justinian Goldstone , we apprehend you , sir , upon suspicion
of felony .
Me ?
You , sir .
I charge you , in the king 's name , gentlemen , to assist us .
Master Tailby !
The same man , sir .
Life , what 's the news ?
Ha' you forgot Combe Park ?
Combe Park ? No, 'tis in Kingston way .
I believe you 'll find it so .
I not deny it .
Bear witness , has confessed .
What have I confessed ? Pair of coxcombs indubitable !
I was robb 'd finely of this chain of pearl there , and forty fair
spur-royals .
Did I rob you ?
There where I find my goods I may suspect , sir .
I dreamt this would be his end .
See how I am wrong 'd , gentlemen : as I 've a soul , I found this
chain of pearl not three yards from this place , just when I met
you .
Ha , ha !
Yet the law 's such , if he but swear 'tis you , you 're gone .
Pox on't , that e 'er I saw't !
Can you but swear 'tis he ? Do but that , and you tickle him , i'faith .
Nay , and it come once to swearing , let me alone .
Say , and hold ; he called my jewels counterfeit , and so cheated
the poor wench of 'em .
Come , bring him away , come .
' Twill call my state in question .
I think what 's got by theft doth never prosper ;
Now lost my chain of pearl.--Come , Master Goldstone ,
Let go this ; 'tis mine , i'faith .
The chain of pearl ?
By my troth , it 's mine .
By my troth , much good do 't you , sir .
I 'm glad in my soul , sir .
Deliver your weapons .
How !
You 're apprehended upon suspicion of felony .
Felony ! What 's that ?
Was it you , i'faith , sir , all this while , that did me that kindness
to ease both my pockets at Combe Park ?
I , sir ?
Pray , gentlemen , draw near ; let 's talk among ourselves .
gallants
Must every gentleman
Be upbraided in public that flies out
Now and then upon necessity ,
To be themes for pedlars and weavers ? This should
Not be : 'twas never seen among the Romans ,
Nor read we of it in the time of Brute :
Are we more brutish now ?
Did I list to blab , do not I know your course
Of life , Master Tailby to be as base
As the basest , maintained by me , by him , by all
Of us , and 'a second-hand from mistresses ?
I 've their letters here to show .
Why should you be so violent to strip naked
Another 's reputation to the world ,
Knowing your own so leprous ?
Beside , this chain of pearl and those spur-royals
Came to you falsely ; for she broke her faith ,
And made her soul a strumpet with her body ,
When she sent those ; they were ever justly mine .
Pray , what moves you , sir ? Why should you
shake your head ?
You 're clear ; sure I should know you , sir : pray , are you not sometimes
a pander , and oftener a bawd , sir ? Have I never sinned in your
banqueting boxes , your bowers and towers ? You slave , that keeps
fornication upon the tops of trees , the very birds cannot engender
in quiet for you ! Why , rogue , that goes in good clothes made
out of wenches ' cast gowns--
Nothing goes so near my heart as that .
Do you shake your slave 's noddle ?
And here 's a rascal look 'st away too--saving the presence of
Master Goldstone--a nittical broker , pricked
up in pawns from the hat-band to the shoe-string ; a necessary
hook to hang gentlemen 's suits out i' th ' air , lest they should
grow musty with long lying , which his pawns seldom are guilty
of ; a fellow of several scents and steams , French , Dutch , Italian ,
English , and therefore his lice must needs be mongrels : why , bill-money--
I am sorry to hear this among you : you 've all deceived me ; truly
I took you for other spirits . You must pardon me henceforward ;
I have a reputation to look to ; I must be no more seen in your
companies .
Nay , nay , nay , nay , Master Goldstone , you must not 'scape so ,
i'faith , one word before you go , sir .
Pray , despatch then ; I would not for half my revenues , i'faith ,
now , that any gallants should pass by in the meantime , and find
me in your companies ; nay , as quick as you can , sir .
You did not take away Master Bouser 's cloak t 'other morning , pawned
it to me , and borrowed five pound upon't ?
Ha !
' Twas not you neither that finely cheated my little novice at
Master Primero 's house of a diamond and sapphire , and swore they
were counterfeit , both glass , mere glass , as you were a right
gentleman ?
' Slife , why were we strangers all this while ? 'Sfoot , I perceive
we are all natural brothers ! A pox on 's all , are we found , i'faith ?
A cheater !
A thief , a lecher , a bawd , and a broker !
What mean they to be so merry ? I 'm afraid they laugh at us , and
make fools on 's .
Push , leave it to me . How now , who
would you speak withal ?
Speak withal ! Have we waited all this while for a suspected thief ?
How ? You 're scarce awake yet , I think : look well , does any appear
like a thief in this company ? Away , you slaves ! You stand loitering
when you should look to the commonwealth : you catch knaves apace
now , do you not ? They may walk by your nose , you rascals !
Sweet Master Goldstone !
You lacked spirit in your company till I came among you : here
be five on 's ; let 's but glue together , why now the world shall
not come between us .
If we be true among ourselves .
Why , true ; we cannot lack to be rich , for we cannot lack riches ,
nor can our wenches want , nor we want wenches .
Let me alone to furnish you with them .
And me .
There 's one care past : and as for the knight 's daughter ,
Our chiefest business , and least thought upon--
That 's true , i'faith .
How shall we agree for her ?
With as much ease as for the rest . Tomorrow
Brings the night : let 's all appear in the best shape
We may ; troth is , we have need on't : and when
Amongst us five she makes election ,
As one she shall choose--
True , she cannot but choose .
That one so fortunate amongst us five
Shall bear himself more portly , live regarded ,
Keep house , and be a countenance to the rest .
Admirable !
For instance ;
Put case yourself , after some robbery done ,
Were pursu 'd hardly , why , there were your shelter ,
You know your sanctuary ; nay , say you were taken ,
His letter to the justice will strike 't dead :
' Tis policy to receive one for the head .
Let 's hug thee , Goldstone .
What have I begot ?
What , sir ?
I must plot for you all ; it likes me rarely .
Prithee , what is't , sir ?
' Twould strike Fitsgrave pale ,
And make the other suitors appear blanks .
For our united mysteries .
What if we five presented our full shapes
In a strange , gallant and conceited masque ?
In a masque ? Your thoughts and mine were twins .
So the device were subtle , nothing like it .
Some poet must assist us .
Poet ?
You 'll take the direct line to have us stag 'd ?
Why , what lacks Bouser ? Are you too well , too safe ?
An absolute scholar ; easy to be wrought ,
No danger in the operation .
But have you so much interest ?
What , in Bouser ?
Why , my least word commands him .
Then no man fitter .
And there 's Master Frip , too ,
Can furnish us of masquing suits enow .
Upon sufficient pawn , I think I can , sir .
Pawn ? Jew , here , take my chain : pawns among brothers ?
We shall thrive ! But we must still expect
One rogue in five , and think us happy , too .
Last man we spoke on , Master Bouser .
Little Master Bouser , sweet Master Bouser , welcome , i'faith .
Are your fathers dead , gentlemen , you 're so merry ?
By my troth , a good jest ! Did not I commend his wit to you , gentlemen ?
Hark , sirrah Ralph Bouser , cousin Bouser , i'faith , there 's a
kind of portion in town , a girl of fifteen hundred , whom we all
powerfully affect , and determine to present our parts to her in
a masque .
In a masque .
Right , sir : now , a little of thy brain for a device to present
us firm , which we shall never be able to do ourselves , thou knowest
that ; and with a kind of speech wherein thou mayst express what
gallants are , bravely .
Pooh , how can I express 'em otherwise but bravely ? Now for a
Mercury , and all were fitted .
Could not a boy supply it ?
Why , none better .
I have a boy shall put down all the Mercuries i' th ' town ; 'a
will play a Mercury naturally , at his fingers ' ends , i'faith .
Why , then we are suited : for torch-bearers and shield-boys , those
are always the writer 's properties ; you 're not troubled with them .
Come , my little Bouser , do 't finely now , to the life .
I warrant you , gentlemen .
Hist ; give me a little touch above
the rest , and you can possible , for I mean to present this chain
of pearl to her .
Now I know that , let me alone to fit
you .
Come forth , you wary , private whispering strumpet !
Have we found your close haunts ,
Your private watch-towers , and your subtle means ?
How then ?
You can steal secretly hither ,
You mystical quean you , at twilight , twitter-lights !
You have a privilege from your hat , forsooth ,
To walk without a man , and no suspicion ;
But we poor gentlewomen that go in tires
Have no such liberty , we cannot do thus :
Custom grants that to you that 's shame in us .
Have you done yet ?
You broke the back of one husband already ;
And now th ' other 's dead with grief at sea ,
With your secret expenses , close stealths , cunning
Filches , and continued banquets in corners .
Then , forsooth , you must have your milk-baths to white you ,
Your roseleaves to sweeten you ,
Your bean-flour bags to sleek you , and make you soft ,
Smooth , and delicate , for lascivious entertainment
So , and you think all this while you dance like a thief in a mist ,
you 're safe , nobody can find you ! Pray , were not you a feltmonger 's
daughter at first , that run away with a new courtier for the love
of gentlewomen 's clothes , and bought the fashion at a dear rate ,
with the loss of your name and credit ? Why , what are all of you
but rustical insides and city flesh , the blood of yeomen , and
the bum of gentlewomen ?
What , shall we suffer a changeable forepart out-tongue us ? Take
that !
Murder , murder !
How now ! Why , ladies , a retreat ! Come ,
You have shown your spirits sufficiently :
You 're all land-captains ; and so they shall find
That come in your quarters ; but have you the law
Free now to fight and scratch among yourselves ,
And let your gallants run away with others ?
How !
Good--
Sweet Master Bouser !
Another ?
Why then , I perceive you know nothing : why , they are in the way
of marriage ; a knight 's daughter here in town makes her election
among 'em this night .
This night ?
This very night ; and they all present themselves in a masque before
her : know you not this ?
O traitor Master Goldstone !
Perjured Master Tailby !
Without soul ?
She will chase him !
You have more cause to join ,
And play the grounds of friendship 'mongst yourselves ,
Than rashly run division : I could tell you
A means to pleasure you--
Good Master Bouser !
But that you 're women , and are hardly secret--
We vow it seriously .
You should be all there in presence ,
See all , hear all , and yet not they perceive you .
So that--
Sweet Master Bouser , I--
I can
Stand you in stead ; for I frame the device .
If ever--
Will you do 't ? Hark you--
Content .
And I 'll make one .
And I another :
We 'll mar the match .
MISTRESS NEWCUT
When that good news came of my husband 's death ,
Goldstone promis 'd me marriage , and sware to me--
I 'll bring his oaths in question .
So will I.
Agree among yourselves , for shame !
Are we
Resolv 'd ?
In this who would not feign ?
Friends all ,
For my part .
MISTRESS NEWCUT
Here 's my lip for mine .
Round let it go .
All wrath thus quench 'd .
And I conclude it so .
How all events strike even with my wishes !
Their own invention damns them .
Now , gentlemen ,
Stands your assistance firm ?
Why , 'tis our own case ;
I 'm sorry you should doubt .
We 'll furnish you .
BUNGLER
Are these our gallants ?
Are our gallants these ?
Here be five shields , sir .
Finished already ? That 's well : I 'll see thy master shortly .
I 'm satisfied .
Prithee , let 's see , Master Fitsgrave .
I have blazed them .
What 's this ?
Fooh , you should be a gallant too , for you 're no university scholar .
Look , this is Pursenet ; the device , a purse wide open , and the
mouth downward : the word ,
What 's that ?
" One that lives out of other men 's pockets . "
That 's right !
Here 's Goldstone 's , three silver dice .
They run high , two cinques and a quater !
Nay , he will cheat his own brother ; nay , his own father , i'faith !
So much the word imports . Master Primero .
BUNGLER
Pox , what says he now ?
What 's that ?
" One that sells maidenheads by wholesale . "
Excellently proper !
Master Frip .
That Pythagorical rascal ! In a gentleman 's suit today , in a knight 's
tomorrow .
know as the sparrow hatches the cuckoo , so the gentleman feathers
the broker .
Let me admire thee , Master Fitsgrave !
They will scorn , gentlemen ; and to assist them the better , Pursenet 's
boy , that little precious pickpocket , has a compendious speech
in Latin , and , like a Mercury , presents their dispositions more
liberally .
Never were poor gallants so abused .
Hang 'em ! They 're counterfeits ;
No honest spirit will pity 'em . This is my crown ;
So good men smile , I dread no rascal 's frown .
Away , bestow yourselves secretly o 'erhead ;
This is the place appointed for the rehearsal ,
To practise their behaviours .
We are vanish 'd .
Master Bouser .
Well said , i'faith ; off with your cloaks , gallants ; let 's fall
roundly to our business .
Is the boy perfect ?
That 's my credit , sir , I warrant you .
If our little Mercury should be out , we should scarce be known
what we are .
I have took a course for that , fear it not , sir . Look you , first ,
here be your shields .
Ay , where be our shields ?
Which is mine ?
Which is mine , Master Bouser ? This ?
I pray , be contained a little , gentlemen ; they 'll come all time
enough to you , I warrant .
This Frip is grown so violent !
Yours to begin withal , sir .
Well said , Master Bouser !
First the device , a fair purse wide open , the mouth downward ;
the word ,
What 's that , prithee ?
" Your bounty pours itself forth to all men . "
And so it does , i'faith ; that 's all my fault , bountiful .
Master Goldstone , here 's yours , sir ; three silver dice ; the word ,
And what 's that ?
" Fortune of my side . "
Well said , little Bouser , i'faith !
What say you to me , sir ?
The meaning of that , sir ?
" My light is yet in darkness till I enjoy her . "
Right , sir .
Now mine , sir ?
The device , an unvalued pearl hid in a cave .
Aha , sirs !
The word ,
Very good , I warrant .
A black man 's a pearl in a fair lady 's eye . "
I said 'twas some such thing .
My turn must need come now : am I fitted , Master Bouser ?
Trust to me : your device here is a cuckoo sitting on a tree .
The Welsh leiger ; good .
The word ,
Ay , marry , sir .
Why , do you know what 'tis , sir ?
No, by my troth , not yet , sir .
O ! " I keep one tune , I recant not . "
I 'm like the cuckoo in that indeed : where I love , I hold .
Did I not promise you I would fit you ?
They 're all very well done , i'faith , and very scholarlike , though
I say 't before thy face , little Bouser ; but I would not have thee
proud on't now : come , if this be performed well--
Who , the boy ? He has performed deeper matters than this .
Ay , a pox on him ! I think was in my pocket now ,
and truth were known .
I caught him once in mine .
Suppose the shields are presented , then you begin , boy .
I representing Mercury , am a pickpocket , and have his part at
my fingers ' ends : " Page I am to that great and secret thief ,
FITSGRAVE
There you make your honour , sir .
At
FITSGRAVE
You have it , sir .
PURSENET
that 's mine .
He confesses the thief 's his .
Remember , boy , you point to me .
To you , master .
Proceed .
BOY
" These four are his companions ; the one a notable cheater ,
that will cozen his own father--"
Master Goldstone .
Let me alone , Master Bouser ; I can take mine own turn .
Why--
Peace .
BOY
That 's I , Master Bouser .
There you remember your honour , sir .
It sounds very well , i'faith .
is no
the event . "
I'faith , here 's all now , gentlemen .
Short and pithy .
A good boy , i'faith , and a pregnant !
I dare put trust in the boy , sir . Forget not ,
sirrah , at any hand , to point that same to me .
I warrant you , master .
Come , gentlemen , the time beckons us away .
Ay , furnish , gentlemen , furnish .
Hark , one word , Master Bouser : what 's the
I have a good mind to that word , i'faith .
Why , shrieve of the shire . "
I'faith , and I have shriven some shires in my days .
Now , gentlemen , are you satisfied and pleas 'd ?
Never more amply .
Amongst us now falls that desired lot ,
For we shall blast five rivals with one plot .
Grave gentlemen , in whose approved bosoms
My deceas 'd father did repose much faith ,
You 're dearly welcome : pray , sit , command music ;
See nothing want to beautify this night ,
That holds my election in her peaceful arms ;
Feasts , music , hymns , those sweet celestial charms .
May you be blest in this election .
That content may meet perfection .
Sound lute , bandora gittern ,
Viol , virginals , and cittern ;
Voices spring , and lift aloud
Her name that makes the music proud !
This night perfection
Makes her election .
Follow , follow , follow , follow round ,
Look you to that , nay , you to that , nay , you to that :
Anon you will be found , anon you will be found , anon you will be found .
Are you all as the speech and shields display you ?
We shall prove so .
The very chain of pearl was filch 'd from me !
Hold ! Stop the boy there !
Will none lay hands on him ?
How now ?
Alas , I 'm but a broker ! ' Twas pawned to me in my shop .
Ha , Fitsgrave !
Pyamont , and the rest !
Where 's Bouser ?
Here .
We are all betrayed !
Betrayed ? You 're not worthy to be to betrayed , you have not
so much worth : nay , struggle not with the net , you are caught
for this world .
FIRST COURTESAN
Would we were out !
' Twas I fram 'd your device , do you see ? ' Twas I !
The whole assembly has took notice of it .
That you are a gallant cheater ,
So much the pawning of my cloak contains ;
Tailby and tell me
That you 're a hired smockster ; here 's her letter ,
In which we are certified that you 're a bawd .
The broker has confessed it .
So has the boy .
That boy will be hanged ; he stole the chain at first ,
And has thus long maintained his master 's gallantry
All which we here present , like captive slaves ,
Waiting that doom which their presumption craves .
How easily may our suspectless sex
With fair appearing shadows be deluded !
Dear sir , you have the work so well begun ,
That took from you , small glory would be won .
Since 'tis your pleasure to refer to me
The doom of these , I have provided so ,
They shall not altogether lose their cost :
See , I have brought wives for 'em .
Heart , the strumpets ! Out , out !
Having assum 'd , out of their impudence ,
The shape of shield-boys !
To heap full confusion !
Rather confine us to strict chastity ,
A mere impossible task , than to wed these ,
Whom we do loathe worse than the foul 'st disease .
O grant 'em their requests !
The doom is past ; so , since your aim was marriage ,
Either embrace it in these courtesans ,
Or have your base acts and felonious lives
Proclaim 'd to the indignation of the law ,
Which will provide a public punishment .
As for the boy , and that infectious bawd ,
We put forth those to whipping .
Whipping ? You find not that in the statute to whip satin .
Away with him !
Since all our shifts are discovered , as far as I can see , 'tis
our best course to marry 'em ; we 'll make them get our livings .
He says true .
You see how we are threatened : by my troth , wenches , be ruled
by me ; let 's marry 'em , and it be but to plague 'em ; for when
we have husbands we are under covert-baron , and may lie with whom
we list ! I have tried that in my t 'other husband 's days .
ALL THE COURTESANS
A match .
I 'll be no more deferr 'd : come , when do you join ?
These forc 'd marriages do never come to good .
How can they when they come to such as you ?
They often prove the ruin of great houses .
Nor , virgin , do I in this seek to entice
All glory to myself ; these gentlemen ,
Whom I am bound to love for kind assistance ,
Had great affinity in the plot with me .
To them I give my thanks ; myself to thee ,
Thrice-worthy Fitsgrave !
I have all my wishes .
And I presume there 's none but those can frown ,
Whose envies , like the rushes , we tread down .
