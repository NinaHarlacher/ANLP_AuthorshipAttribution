Thy worst .
I fart at thee .
Ha' you your Wits ?
Why Gentlemen ! for
love ?
Sirrah , I 'll strip you ?
What to do ?
lick Figs
Out at my ?
Rogue , Rogue , out of all your sleights .
Nay , look ye , Sovereign , General , are you Madmen ?
O , let the wild Sheep loose .
I 'll Gum your Silks
With good Strong-warter , an' you come .
Will you have
The Neighbours hear you ?
Will you betray all ?
Heark , I hear some body .
Sirrah ?
I shall mar
All that the Taylor has made , if you approach .
You most notorious Whelp , you insolent Slave ,
Dare you do this ?
Yes faith , yes faith .
Why , who
Am I , my Mungril ?
who am I ?
I 'll tell you ,
Since you know not your self ?
Speak lower , Rogue .
You were once (time 's not long past ) the good ,
Honest , plain , Livery-three-pound-thrum , that kept
Your Masters Worships House here in the Friers ,
For the Vacations ?
Will you be so lowd ?
Since , by my means , translated Suburb-Captain .
By your means , Doctor Dog ?
Within Man 's memory ,
All this I speak of .
Why , I pray you , have I
Been countenanc 'd by you , or you by me ?
Do but collect , Sir , where I met you first .
I do not hear well .
Not of this , I think it .
But I shall put you in mind , Sir ; at Pie-corner ,
Taking your meal of Steam in , from Cooks Stalls ;
Where , like the Father of Hunger , you did walk
Piteously costive , with your pinch 'd-horn-nose ,
And your Complexion of the Roman Wash ,
Stuck full of black and melancholick Worms ,
Like Powder-corns shot at th ' Artillery-yard .
I wish you could advance your Voice a little .
When you went pinn 'd up in the several Rags
Yo ' had rak 'd and pick 'd from Dunghils , before day ;
Your Feet in mouldy Slippers , for your Kibes
A Felt of Rug , and a thin thredden Cloke ,
That scarce would cover your no-Buttock ? ?
So , Sir !
When all your Alchemy , and your Algebra ,
Your Minerals , Vegetals , and Animals ,
E e 2 Your
Your Conjuring , Coz'ning , and your dozen of Trades ,
Could not relieve your Corps with so much Linnen
Would make you Tinder , but to see a Fire ;
I ga' you Count 'nance , Credit for your Coals ,
Your Stills , your Glasses , your Materials ;
Built you a Fornace , drew you Customers ,
Advanc 'd all your black Arts ; lent you , beside ,
A House to practise in ?
Your Master 's House ?
Where you have studied the more thriving Skill
Of Bawd 'ry since .
Yes , in your Master 's House .
You and the Rats here kept possession .
Make it not strange .
I know yo ' were one could keep
The Buttry-hatch still lock 'd , and save the Chippings ,
Sell the Dole-Beer to Aqua-vit?-men ,
The which , together with you Christmass Vails
At Post and Pair , your letting out of Counters ,
Made you a pretty Stock , some twenty Marks ,
And gave you credit to converse with Cobwebs ,
Here , since your Mistris Death hath broke up House .
You might talk softlier , Rascal .
No, you Scarabe ,
I 'll thunder you in pieces : I will teach you
How to beware to tempt a Fury again ,
That carries Tempest in his Hand and Voice .
The Place has made you valiant .
No, your Clothes .
Thou Vermin , have I tane thee out of Dung ,
So poor , so wretched , when no living thing
Would keep thee Company , but a Spider , or worse ?
Rais 'd thee from Brooms , and Dust , and Watring Pots ?
Sublim 'd thee , and exalted thee , and fix 'd thee
I ' the Third Region , call 'd our State of Grace ?
Wrought thee to Spirit , to Quintessence , with pains
Would twice have won me the Philosopher 's Work ?
Put thee in Words and Fashion , made thee fit
For more than ordinary Fellowships ?
Giv'n thee thy Oaths , thy quarelling Dimensions ?
Thy Rules to cheat at Horse-race , Cock-pit , Cards ,
Dice , or whatever gallant Tincture else ?
Made thee a Second in mine own great Art ?
And have I this for thanks ?
Do you rebel ?
Do you fly out i' the Projection ?
Would you be gone now ?
Gentlemen , what mean you ?
Will you mar all ?
Slave , thou hadst had no Name ?
Will you undo your selves with Civil War ?
Never been known , past Equi clibanum ,
The heat of Horse-dung , under Ground , in Cellars ,
Or an Ale-house darker than deaf John 's ; been lost
To all Mankind , but Laundresses and Tapsters ,
Had not I been .
Do you know who hears you , Sovereign ?
Sirrah ? ?
Nay , General , I thought you were civil ? ?
I shall turn desperate , if you grow thus lowd .
And hang thy self , I care not .
Hang thee , Colliar ,
And all thy Pots and Pans , in Picture , I will ,
Since thou hast mov 'd me ? ? ?
( O , this 'll orethrow all . )
Write thee up Bawd in Pauls , have all thy Tricks
Of coz'ning with a hollow Coal , Dust , Scrapings ,
Searching for things lost with a Sieve and Shears ,
Erecting Figures in your Rows of Houses ,
And taking in of Shadows with a Glass ,
Told in Red Letters ; and a Face cut for thee ,
Worse than Gamaliel Ratsey 's .
Are you sound ?
Ha' you your Senses , Masters ?
I will have
A Book , but barely reckoning thy Impostures ,
Shall prove a true Philosophers Stone , to Printers .
Away , you Trencher-Rascal .
Out , you Dog-leach ,
The Vomit of all Prisons ?
Will you be
Your own Destructions , Gentlemen ?
Still spew 'd out
For lying too heavy o ' the Basket .
O me !
We are ruin 'd ! lost ! Ha' you no more regard
To your Reputations ?
Where 's your Judgment ?
' Slight ,
Have yet some care of me , o ' your Republick ?
Away , this Brach .
I 'll bring thee , Rogue , within
The Statute of Sorcery , Tricesimo tertio
Of Harry the Eighth : I , and ( perhaps ) thy Neck
Within a Noose , for laundring Gold , and barbing it .
You 'll bring your Head within a Cockscomb ,
will you ?
And you , Sir , with your Menstrue , gather it up .
'Sdeath , you abominable Pair of Stinkards ,
Leave off your Barking , and grow one again ,
Or , by the Light that shines , I 'll cut your Throats .
I 'll not be made a Prey unto the Marshal ,
For ne 'er a snarling Dog-bolt o ' you both .
Ha' you together cozen 'd all this while ,
And all the World ?
and shall it now be said ,
Yo ' have made most courteous shift to cozen your selves ?
You will accuse him ?
You will bring him in
Within the Statute ?
Who shall take your word ?
A whoreson , upstart , Apocryphal Captain ,
Whom not a Puritan in Black-Friars will trust
So much as for a Feather ! And you too
Will give the Cause , forsooth ?
You will insult ,
And claim a Primacy in the Divisions ?
You must be Chief ?
As if you only had
The Powder to project with , and the Work
Were not begun out of Equality ?
The Venture Tripartite ?
All things in common ?
Without Priority ?
'Sdeath , you perpetual Curs ,
Fall to your Couples again , and cozen kindly ,
And heartily , and lovingly , as you should ,
And lose not the beginning of a Term ,
Or , by this Hand , I shall grow factious too ,
And take my part , and quit you .
' Tis his fault ,
He ever murmurs , and objects his Pains ,
And says , the weight of all lies upon him .
Why , so it does .
How does it ?
Do not we
Sustain our Parts ?
Yes , but they are not equal .
Why , if your Part exceed to day , I hope
Ours may to morrow match it .
I , they may .
May , murmuring Mastiff ! I , and do .
Death on me !
Help me to throttle him .
Dorothee , Mistris Dorothee ,
'Ods precious , I 'll do any thing .
What do you mean ?
Because o ' your Fermentation and Cibation ?
Not I , by Heaven ? ?
Your Sol and Luna ?
help me .
Would I were hang 'd then .
I 'll conform my self .
Will you , Sir ?
Do so then , and quickly : swear .
What should I swear ?
To leave your Faction , Sir ,
And labour kindly in the Common Work .
Let me not breathe , if I meant ought beside .
I only us 'd those Speeches as a Spur
To him .
I hope we need no Spurs , Sir . Do we ?
' Slid , prove to day , who shall shark best .
Yes , and work close , and friendly .
' Slight , the Knot
Shall grow the stronger for this Breach , with me .
Why , so my good Baboons ! Shall we go make
A sort of sober , scurvy , precise Neighbours ,
( That scarce have smil 'd twice sin' the King came in )
A Feast of Laughter at our Follies ?
Rascals ,
Would run themselves from breath , to see me ride ,
Or you t 'have but a Hole to thrust your Heads in ,
For which you should pay Ear-rent ?
No, agree .
And may Don Provost ride a feasting long ,
In his old Velvet Jerkin and stain 'd Scarfs ,
( My noble Sovereign , and worthy General )
Ere
Ere we contribute a new Crewel Garter
To his most Worsted Worship .
Royal Dol !
Spoken like Claridiana , and thy self .
For which , at Supper , thou shalt sit in triumph ,
And not be styl 'd Dol Common , but Dol Proper ,
Dol Singular : The longest Cut , at Night ,
Shall draw thee for his Dol Particular .
Who 's that ?
one rings .
To the Windo' , Dol .
Pray Heav'n ,
The Master do not trouble us this Quarter .
O , fear not him .
While there dies one a Week
O' the Plague , he 's safe , from thinking toward London .
Beside , he 's busie at his Hop-yards now :
I had a Letter from him .
If he do ,
He 'll send such word , for airing o ' the House ,
As you shall have sufficient time to quit it :
Though we break up a Fortnight , 'tis no matter .
Who is it , Dol ?
A fine young Quodling .
O ,
My Lawyers Clerk , I lighted on last night
In Holborn , at the Dagger .
He would have
( I told you of him ) a Familiar ,
To rifle with at Horses , and win Cups .
O , let him in .
Who shall do 't ?
Get you
Your Robes on : I will meet him , as going out .
And what shall I do ?
Not be seen , away .
Seem you very reserv 'd .
God b' w ' you , Sir .
I pray you let him know that I was here .
His Name is Dapper .
I would gladly have staid , but ?
Who 's that ?
He 's come , I think , Doctor .
Good faith , Sir , I was going away .
In truth ,
I am very sorry , Captain .
But I thought
Sure I should meet you .
I , I am very glad .
I had a scurvy Writ or two to make ,
And I had lent my Watch last night to one
That dines to day at the Sheriffs , and so was robb 'd
Of my pass-time .
Is this the Cunning-man ?
This is his Worship .
Is he a Doctor ?
And ha' you broke with him , Captain ?
And how ?
Faith , he does make the matter , Sir , so dainty ,
I know not what to say ?
Not so , good Captain .
Would I were fairly rid on't , believe me .
Nay , now you grieve me , Sir . Why should you
wish so ?
I dare assure you , I 'll not be ungrateful .
I cannot think you will , Sir . But the Law
Is such a thing ?
And then he says , Read 's Matter
Falling so lately ?
Read ?
He was an Ass ,
And dealt , Sir , with a Fool .
It was a Clerk , Sir .
A Clerk ?
Nay , hear me , Sir , you know the Law
Better , I think ?
I should , Sir , and the Danger .
You know , I shew 'd the Statute to you ?
You did so .
And will I tell then ?
By this Hand of Flesh ,
Would it might never write good Court-hand more ,
If I discover .
What do you think of me ,
That I am a Chiause ?
What 's that ?
The Turk was , here ?
As one would say , Do you think I am a Turk ?
I 'll tell the Doctor so .
Do , good sweet Captain .
Come , noble Doctor , pray thee let 's prevail ;
This is the Gentleman , and he is no Chiause .
Captain , I have return 'd you all my Answer .
I would do much , Sir , for your Love ?
But this
I neither may , nor can .
Tut , do not say so .
You deal now with a noble Fellow , Doctor ,
One that will thank you richly , and h ' is no Chiause :
Let that , Sir , move you .
Pray you , forbear ? ?
He has
Four Angels here ? ?
You do me wrong , good Sir .
Doctor , wherein ?
To tempt you with these Spirits ?
To tempt my Art , and Love , Sir , to my peril .
' Fore Heav'n , I scarce can think you are my Friend ,
That so would draw me to apparent danger .
I draw you ?
A Horse draw you , and a Halter ,
You , and your Flies together ?
Nay , good Captain .
That know no difference of Men .
Good words , Sir .
Good deeds , Sir , Doctor Dogs-meat .
' Slight , I bring you
No cheating Clim o ' the Cloughs , or Claribels ,
That look as big as Five-and-fifty , and Flush ,
And spit out Secrets like hot Custard ?
Nor any melancholick Under-scribe ,
Shall tell the Vicar ; but a special Genteel ,
That is the Heir to Forty Marks a Year ,
Consorts with the small Poets of the time ,
Is the sole Hope of his old Grandmother ,
That knows the Law , and writes you six fair Hands ,
Is a fine Clerk , and has his Cyph'ring perfect ,
Will take his Oath o ' the Greek Xenophon ,
If need be , in his Pocket ; and can court
His Mistris out of Ovid .
Nay , dear Captain .
Did you not tell me so ?
Yes , but I'ld ha' you
Use Master Doctor with some more respect .
Hang him , proud Stag , with his broad Velvet Head .
But for your sake , I'ld choak , ere I would change
An Article of Breath with such a Puckfoist ? ?
Come , let 's be gone .
Pray you le ' me speak with you .
His Worship calls you ,Captain .
I am sorry
I ere imbark 'd my self in such a Business ,
Nay , good Sir , he did call you .
Will he take then ?
First , hear me ? ?
Not a Syllable , 'less you take .
Pray ye , Sir ? ?
Upon no Terms , but an Assumpsit .
Your Humour must be Law .
Why now , Sir , talk .
Now I dare hear you with mine Honour .
So may this Gentleman too .
Why , Sir ? ?
No whispering .
' Fore Heav'n , you do not apprehend the Loss
You do your self , in this .
Wherein ?
For what ?
Marry , to be so importunate for one ,
That , when he has it , will undo you all :
He 'll win up all the Money i' the Town .
How !
Yes , and blow up Gamester after Gamester ,
As they do Crackers in a Puppet-play .
If I do give him a Familiar ,
Give you him all you play for ; never set him :
For he will have it .
You are mistaken , Doctor .
Why , he does ask one but for Cups and Horses ,
A rifling Fly ; none o ' your great Familiars .
Yes , Captain , I would have it for all Games .
I told you so .
' Slight , that 's a new Business !
I understood you , a tame Bird , to fly
Twice in a Term , or so , on Friday Nights ,
When you had left the Office , for a Nag
Of forty or fifty Shillings .
I , 'tis true , Sir ;
But I do think now I shall leave the Law ,
And therefore ?
Why , this changes quite the Case !
Do ' you think that I dare move him ?
If you please , Sir ;
All 's one to him , I see .
What ! for that Money ?
I cannot with my Conscience : Nor should you
Make the Request , methinks .
No, Sir , I mean
To
To add Consideration .
Why then , Sir ,
I 'll try .
Say that it were for all Games , Doctor ?
I say then , not a Mouth shall eat for him
At any Ordinary , but o ' the Score ,
That is a Gaming Mouth , conceive me .
Indeed !
He 'll draw you all the Treasure of the Realm ,
If it be set him .
Speak you this from Art ?
I , Sir , and Reason too , the Ground of Art .
H' is o ' the only best Complexion ,
The Queen of Fairy loves .
What ! is he ! Sub .
He 'll over-hear you .
Sir , should she but see him ?
What ?
Do not you tell him .
Will he win at Cards too ?
The Spirits of dead Holland , living Isaac ,
You 'ld swear , were in him ; such a vigorous Luck
As cannot be resisted .
' Slight , he 'll put
Six o ' your Gallants to a Cloak , indeed .
A strange Success , that some Man shall be born to!
He hears you , Man ?
Sir , I 'll not be ingrateful .
Faith , I have confidence in his good nature :
You hear , he says he will not be ingrateful .
Why , as you please ; my Venture follows yours .
Troth , do it , Doctor ; think him trusty , and make him .
He may make us both happy in an Hour ;
Win some five thousand Pound , and send us two o ' it .
Believe it , and I will , Sir . Fac.
And you shall , Sir .
You have heard all ?
No, what was 't ?
nothing , I , Sir .
Nothing ?
A little , Sir . Fac.
Well , a rare Star
Reign 'd at your Birth .
At mine , Sir ?
The Doctor
Swears that you are ?
Nay , Captain , you 'll tell all now .
Allied to the Queen of Fairy .
Who ?
that I am ?
Believe it , no such matter ?
Yes , and that
Yo ' were born with a Cawl o ' your Head .
Who says so ?
Come ,
You know it well enough , tho ' you dissemble it .
I-fac , I do not : You are mistaken .
How !
Swear by your fac ?
and in a thing so known
Unto the Doctor ?
How shall we , Sir , trust you
I ' the other matter ?
Can we ever think ,
When you have won five or six thousand Pound ,
You 'll send us Shares in't , by this rate ?
By Jove , Sir ,
I 'll win ten thousand Pound , and send you half .
I-fac 's no Oath .
No, no , he did but jest .
Go to .
Go thank the Doctor .
He 's your Friend ,
To take it so .
I thank his Worship .
So :
Another Angel .
Must I ?
Must you ?
' Slight ,
What else is Thanks ?
Will you be trivial ?
Doctor ,
When must he come for his Familiar ?
Shall I not ha' it with me ?
O , good Sir !
There must a World of Ceremonies pass ,
You must be bath 'd and fumigated first :
Besides , the Queen of Fairy does not rise
Till it be Noon .
Not , if she danc 'd , to night .
And she must bless it .
Did you never see
Her Royal Grace yet ?
Whom ?
your Aunt of Fairy ?
Not since she kist him in the Cradle , Captain ;
I can resolve you that .
Well , see her Grace ,
Whatere it cost you , for a thing that I know .
It will be somewhat hard to compass ; but
However , see her .
Her Grace is a lone Woman ,
And very rich ; and if she take a Phant 'sie ,
She will do strange things .
See her , at any hand .
' Slid , she may hap to leave you all she has !
It is the Doctor 's fear .
How will 't be done then ?
Let me alone , take you no thought .
Do you
But say to me , Captain , I 'll see her Grace .
Captain , I 'll see her Grace .
VVho 's there ?
( Conduct him forth by the back way . )
Sir , against one a clock prepare your self :
Till when you must be fasting ; only take
Three drops of Vinegar in at your Nose ,
Two at your Mouth , and one at either Ear ;
Then bath your Fingers ends , and wash your Eyes ,
To sharpen your Five Senses , and cry Hum
Thrice , and then Buz as often ; and then come .
Can you remember this ?
I warrant you .
VVell then , away .
' Tis but your bestowing
Some Twenty Nobles 'mong her Graces Servants ,
And put on a clean Shirt : You do not know
VVhat her Grace may do you in clean Linnen .
Troth I can do you no good till after-noon . )
What is your Name , say you ?
Abel Drugger ?
Yes , Sir .
A Seller of Tabacco ?
Yes , Sir . Sub .
Free of the Grocers ?
I , an't please you .
Well ?
Your Business , Abel ?
This , an't please your Worship ;
I am a young Beginner , and am building
Of a new Shop , an't like your Worship , just
At corner of a Street : ( Here 's the Plot on't . )
And I would know by Art , Sir , of your VVorship ,
VVhich way I should make my Door , by Necromancy ,
And where my Shelves ; and which should be for Boxes ,
And which for Pots .
I would be glad to thrive , Sir .
And I was wish 'd to your VVorship by a Gentleman ,
One Captain Face , that says you know Mens Planets ,
And their good Angels , and their bad .
I do ,
If I do see 'em ?
VVhat ! my honest Abel ?
Thou art well met here .
Troth , Sir , I was speaking ,
Just as your VVorship came here , of your VVorship .
I pray you speak for me to Master Doctor .
He shall do any thing .
Doctor , do you hear ?
This is my Friend , Abel , an honest Fellow ;
He lets me have good Tabacco , and he does not
Sophisticate it with Sack-lees or Oil ,
Nor washes it in Muscadel and Grains ,
Nor buries it in Gravel , under Ground ,
VVrapp 'd up in greasie Leather , or piss 'd Clouts :
But keeps it in fine Lilly-pots , that open 'd ,
Smell like Conserve of Roses , or French Beans .
He has his Maple Block , his Silver Tongs ,
Winchester Pipes , and Fire of Juniper ,
A neat , spruce , honest Fellow , and no Goldsmith .
H' is a fortunate Fellow , that I am sure on ?
Already , Sir , ha' you found it ?
Lo ' thee , Abel !
And in right way to'ward Riches ?
Sir . Sub .
This Summer
He will be of the Clothing of his Company ,
And next Spring call 'd to the Scarlet ; spend what he can .
What , and so little Beard ?
Sir , you must think ,
He may have a Receit to make Hair come :
But he 'll be wise , preserve his Youth , and fine for't ;
His Fortune looks for him another way .
' Slid , Doctor , how canst thou know this so soon ?
I am amus 'd at that ! Sub .
By a Rule , Captain ,
In Metaposcopy , which I do work by ;
A certain Star i' the Forehead , which you see not .
Your Chestnut , or your Olive-colour 'd Face
Do 's never fail : and your long Ear doth promise .
I knew't , by certain spots too , in his Teeth ,
And on the Nail of his Mercurial Finger .
Which Finger 's that ?
His little Finger .
Yo ' were born upon a Wednesday ?
Yes indeed , Sir .
The Thumb , in Chiromanty , we give Venus ;
The Fore-finger , to Jove ; the midst , to Saturn ;
The
The ring , to Sol ; the least , to Mercury :
Who was the Lord , Sir , of his Horoscope ,
His house of life being Libra ; which fore-shew 'd ,
He should be a Merchant , and should trade with Ballance .
Why , this is strange ! Is't not , honest Nab ?
There is a Ship now , coming from Ormus ,
That shall yield him , such a commodity
Of drugs ?
This is the West , and this the South ?
Yes , Sir . Sub .
And those are your two sides ?
I , Sir .
Make me your Door , then , South ; your Broad-
side , West :
And , on the East-side of your Shop , aloft ,
Write Mathlai , Tarmiel , and Baraborat ;
Upon the North-part , Rael , Velel , Thiel .
They are the names of those Mercurial Spirits ,
That do fright Flyes from Boxes .
Yes , Sir . Sub .
And
Beneath your threshold , bury me a Load-stone
To draw in Gallants , that wear Spurs : The rest ,
They 'll seem to follow .
That 's a secret , Nab !
And , on your Stall , a Puppet , with a Vice ,
And a Court fucus to call City-dames .
You shall deal much with Minerals .
Sir , I have
At home , already ?
I , I know , you have Arsnike ,
Vitriol , Sal-tartre , Argaile , Alkaly ,
Cinoper : I know all .
This Fellow , Captain ,
Will come , in time , to be a great Distiller ,
And give a Say ( I will not say directly ,
But very fair ) at the Philosophers stone .
Why , how now , Abel ! is this true ?
Good
Captain ,
What must I give ?
Nay , I 'll not counsel thee .
Thou hear 'st what Wealth ( he says , spend what thou
canst )
Th'art like to come too .
I would gi' him a Crown .
A Crown ! and toward such a Fortune ?
Heart ,
Thou shalt rather gi' him thy Shop .
No Gold about thee ?
Yes , I have a Portague , I ha' kept this half year .
Out on thee , Nab .
' Slight , there was such an offer ?
' Shalt keep't no longer , I 'll gi' it him for thee ?
Doctor , Nab prays your Worship to drink this , and
swears
He will appear more grateful , as your skill
Do 's raise him in the World .
I would intreat
Another favour of his Worship .
What is't , Nab ?
But , to look over , Sir , my Almanack ,
And cross out my ill-days , that I may neither
Bargain , nor trust upon them .
That he shall Nab .
Leave it , it shall be done , 'gainst Afternoon .
And a direction for his Shelves .
Now , Nab ?
Art thou well pleas 'd , Nab ?
' Thank , Sir , both your
Why , now you smoky persecuter of Nature !
Now do you see , that some-thing 's to be done ,
Beside your Beech-coal , and your cor 'sive Waters ,
Your Crosslets , Crucibles , and Cucurbites ?
You must have Stuff , brought home to you , to work on ?
And , yet , you think , I am at no expence ,
In searching out these Veins , then following 'em ,
Then trying 'em out .
' Fore God , my intelligence
Cost me more Money , than my share oft comes too ,
In these rare Works .
You 'are pleasant , Sir . How now ?
Yonder Fish-wife
Will not away .
And there 's your Giantess ,
The Bawd of Lambeth .
Heart , I cannot speak with 'em .
Not afore night , I have told 'em , in a Voice ,
Thorough the Trunk , like one of your Familiars .
But I have spied Sir Epicure Mammon ?
Where ?
Coming along , at far end of the Lane ,
Slow of his Feet , but earnest of his Tongue ,
To one that 's with him .
Face , go you , and shift .
Dol , you must presently make ready , too ? ?
Why , what 's the matter ?
O , I did look for him
With the Suns rising : ' Marvel , he could sleep !
This is the day I am to perfect for him
The Magisterium , our great work , the Stone :
And yield it , made , into his hands : of which ,
He has , this Month , talk 'd , as he were possess 'd .
And now he 's dealing pieces on't away ,
Me thinks I see him entring Ordinaries ,
Dispensing for the Pox , and Plaguy-houses ,
Reaching his Dose , walking Moore-fields for Lepers ,
And offering Citizens-wives Pomander-braclets ,
As his perservative , made of the Elixir ;
Searching the Spittle , to make old Bawds young ;
And the High-ways , for Beggars , to make rich :
I see no end of his Labours .
He will make
Nature asham 'd , of her long sleep : when Art ,
Who 's but a Step-dame , shall do more than she ,
In her best to love to Mankind , ever could .
If his Dream last , he 'll turn the Age to Gold .
In novo Orbe ; Here 's the rich Peru :
And there within , Sir , are the Golden Mines ,
Great Solomon 's Ophir ! He was sayling to't ,
Three years , but we have reach 'd it in ten Months .
This is the day , wherein , to all my Friends ,
I will pronounce the happy word , Be Rich .
This day you shall be spectatissimi .
You shall no more deal with the hollow Dye ,
Or the frail Card .
No more be at charge of keeping
The Livery-punk , for the young Heir , that must
Seal , at all Hours , in his Shirt .
No more ,
If he deny , ha' him beaten to't , as he is
That brings him the Commodity .
No more
Small thirst of Sattin , or the Covetous hunger
Of Velvet Entrails , for a rude-spun Cloke ,
To be displaid at Madam August a 's , make
The Sons of Sword , and Hazzard fall before
The Golden Calf , and on their Knees , whole Nights ,
Commit Idolatry with Wine , and Trumpets :
Or go a feasting , after Drum and Ensign .
No more of this .
You shall start up young Vice-rois ,
And have your Punques , and Punquetees , my Surly .
} Within } Sir .
And unto thee , I speak it first , Be Rich .
Where is my Subtle , there ?
Within hough ?
He 'll come to you , by and by .
That 's his Fire-drake ,
His Lungs , his Zephyrus , he that puffs his Coals ,
Till he firk Nature up , in her own Center .
You are not faithful , Sir . This night , I 'll change
All , that is Metal , in thy House , to Gold .
And , early in the Merning , will I send
To all the Plumbers , and the Pewterers ,
And buy their Tin , and Lead up : and to Lothbury ,
For all the Copper .
What , and turn that too ?
Yes , and I 'll purchase Devonshire , and Cornwall ,
And make them perfect Indies ! You admire now ?
No faith .
But when you see th ' effects
of the great Medicine !
Of which one part projected on a hundred
Of Mercury , or Venus , or the Moon ,
Shall turn it to as many of the Sun ;
Nay , to a thousand , so ad infinitum :
You will believe me .
Yes , when I see 't , I will .
But , if my Eyes do cozen me so ( and I
Giving
Giving 'em no occasion ) sure I 'll have
A Whore , shall piss 'em out , next day .
Ha ! Why ?
Do you think , I Fable with you ?
I assure you ,
He that has once the flower of the Sun ,
The perfect Ruby , which we call Elixir ,
Not only can do that , but by it 's Vertue ,
Can confer Honour , Love , Respect , long Life ,
Give Safety , Valour , yea , and Victory ,
To whom he will .
In Eight and twenty days ,
I 'll make an old Man , of Fourscore , a Child ,
No doubt , he 's that already .
Nay , I mean ,
Restore his years , renew him , like an Eagle ,
To the fifth Age ; make him get Sons and Daughters ,
Young Giants ; as our Philosophers have done
( The antient Patriarks afore the Flood )
But taking , once a Week , on a Knives Point ,
The quantity of a Grain of Mustard of it :
Become stout Marses , and beget young Cupids .
The decay 'd Vestals of Pickt-hatch would thank
you ,
That keep the Fire a-live , there .
' Tis the secret
Of Nature , naturiz 'd 'gainst all Infections ,
Cures all Diseases , coming of all Causes ;
A month 's Grief in a day ; a years in twelve :
And , of what Age soever , in a month .
Past all the Doses of your drugging Doctors .
I 'll undertake , withal , to fright the Plague
Out o ' the Kingdom , in three Months .
And I 'll
Be bound , the Players shall sing your Praises , then ,
Without their Poets .
Sir , I 'll do 't .
Mean time ,
I 'll give away so much unto my Man ,
Shall serve th ' whole City , with preservative ,
Weekly ; each House his Dose , and at the rate ?
As he that built the Water-work , do 's with Water ?
You are incredulous .
Faith I have a Humour ,
I would not willingly be gull 'd .
Your Stone
Cannot transmute me .
Pertinax Surly ,
Will you believe Antiquity ?
Records ?
I 'll shew you a Book , where Moses , and his Sister ,
And Solomon have written of the Art ;
I , and a Treatise penn 'd by Adam .
How !
O' the Philosophers Stone , and in high Dutch .
Did Adam write , Sir , in high Dutch ?
He did :
Which proves it was the Primitive Tongue .
What
Paper ?
On Cedar Board .
O that , indeed ( they say )
Will last 'gainst Worms .
' Tis like your Irish Wood ,
' Gainst Cob-webs .
I have a piece of Jasons 's Fleece , too ,
Which was no other than a Book of Alchemy ,
Writ in large Sheep-skin , a good fat Ram-vellam .
Such was Pythagoras 's Thigh , Pandora 's Tub ;
And , all that Fable of Medeas Charms ,
The manner of our Work : The Bulls , our Furnace ,
Still breathing Fire : our Argent-vive , the Dragon :
The Dragons Teeth , Mercury Sublimate ,
That keeps the whiteness , hardness , and the biting ;
And they are gather 'd into Jason 's Helm ,
( Th' Alembick ) and then sow 'd in Mars his Field ,
And thence sublim 'd so often , till they are fix 'd .
Both this , th ' Hesperian Garden , Cadmus Story ,
Jove 's Shower , the Boon of Midas , Argus Eyes ,
Boccace his Demogorgon , thousands more ,
All abstract Riddles of our Stone .
How now ?
Is our day come ?
and hold 's it ?
The Evening will set red upon you , Sir ;
You have colour for it , Crimson : the red Ferment
Has done his Office , Three Hours hence , prepare you
To see Projection .
Pertinax , my Surly ,
Again , I say to thee , aloud , Be Rich .
This day , thou shalt have Ingots : and , to Morrow ,
Give Lords th ' affront .
Is it , my Zephyrus , right ?
Blushes the Bolts-head ?
Like a Wench with Child , Sir ,
That were , but now , discover 'd to her Master .
Excellent witty Lungs ! My only care is ,
Where to get stuff enough now , to project on ,
This Town will not half serve me .
No, Sir ?
Buy
The covering off o ' Churches .
That 's true .
Let 'em stand bare , as do their Auditory .
Or cap 'em , new , with Shingles .
No, good Thatch :
Thatch will lye light upo ' the Rafters , Lungs .
Lungs , I will manumit thee , from the Furnace ;
I will restore thee thy Complexion , Puffe ,
Lost in the Embers ; and repair this Brain ,
Hurt wi' the Fume , o ' the Mettals .
I have blown , Sir ,
Hard for your Worship ; thrown by many a Coal ,
When 'twas not Beech ; weigh 'd those I put in , just ,
To keep your heat still even ; These Bleard-eyes
Have wak 'd , to read your several Colours , Sir ,
Of the pale Citron , the green Lyon , the Crow ,
The Peacocks Tail , the plumed Swan .
And , lastly ,
Thou hast descryed the Flower , the Sanguis Agni ?
Yes Sir . Mam .
Where 's Master ?
At 's Pray-
ers , Sir , he ,
Good Man , he 's doing his Devotions ,
For the success .
Lungs , I will set a Period
To all thy Labours : Thou shalt be the Master
Of my Seraglio .
Good , Sir . Mam .
But do you hear ?
I 'll geld you , Lungs .
Yes , Sir . Mam .
For I do mean
To have a List of Wives and Concubines ,
Equal with Solomon , who had the Stone
Alike with me : and I will make me a Back
With the Elixir , that shall be as tough
As Hercules , to encounter Fifty a night .
Th'art sure thou saw 'st it Blood ?
Both Blood and
Spirit , Sir .
I will have all my Beds , blown up ; not stuft :
Down is too hard .
And then , mine Oval Room
Fill 'd with such Pictures as Tiberius took
From Elephantis , and dull Aretine
But coldly imitated .
Then , my Glasses
Cut in more subtil Angles , to disperse ,
And multiply the Figures , as I walk
Naked betweeen my Succub? .
My Mists
I 'll have of Perfume , vapor 'd 'bout the Room ,
To lose our selves in ; and my Baths , like Pits
To fall into : from whence we will come forth ,
And rowl us dry in Gossamour and Roses .
( Is it arriv 'd at Ruby ? )
?
Where I spy
A wealthy Citizen , or rich Lawyer ,
Have a sublim 'd pure Wife , unto that Fellow
I 'll send a thousand Pound , to be my Cuckold .
And I shall carry it ?
I 'll ha' no Bawds ,
But Fathers and Mothers .
They will do it best ,
Best of all others .
And my Flatterers
Shall be the pure , and gravest of Divines ,
That I can get for Money .
My meet Fools ,
Eloquent Burgesses , and then my Poets
The same that writ so subtily of the Fart .
Whom I will entertain still for that Subject .
The few that would give out themselves , to be
Court and Town-stallions , and , each-where , belye
Ladies , who are known most innocent , for them ;
Those will I beg , to make me Eunuchs of :
And they shall fan me with Ten Estrich Tails
A piece , made in a Plume , to gather Wind .
We will be brave , Puffe , now we ha' the Med'cine .
My Meat shall all come in in Indian Shels ,
Dishes of Agat set in Gold , and studded
With Emeralds , Saphirs , Hyacinths , and Rubies .
The Tongues of Carps , Dormise , and Camels Heels ,
Boil 'd i' the Spirit of Sol , and dissolv 'd Pearl ,
( Apicius Diet , 'gainst the Epilepsie )
And I will eat these Broaths with Spoons of Amber ,
Headed
Headed with Diamant , and Carbuncle .
My Foot-boy shall eat Pheasants , calver 'd Salmons ,
Knots , Godwits , Lamprey 's : I my self will have
The Beards of Barbels serv 'd , in stead of Sallads ;
Oil 'd Mushromes ; and the swelling unctuous Paps
Of a fat pregnant Sow , newly cut off ,
Drest with an exquisite , and poynant Sauce ;
For which , I 'll say unto my Cook , There 's Gold ,
Go forth , and be a Knight .
Sir , I 'll go look
A little , how it heightens .
My Shirts
I 'll have of Taffata-sarsnet , soft , and light
As Cob-webs ; and for all my other Rayment ,
It shall be such as might provoke the Persian ,
Were he to teach the World Riot anew .
My Gloves of Fishes , and Birds-skins , perfum 'd
With Gums of Paradise , and Eastern Air ?
And do ' you think to have the Stone , with this ?
No, I do think t ' have all this , with the Stone .
Why , I have heard , he must be homo frugi ,
A Pious , Holy , and Religious Man ,
One free from mortal Sin , a very Virgin .
That makes it , Sir , he is so .
But I buy it .
My venture brings it me .
He , honest Wretch ,
A notable , superstitious , good Soul ,
Has worn his Knees bare , and his Slippers bald ,
With Prayer and Fasting for it : and , Sir , let him
Do ' it alone , for me , still .
Here he comes .
Not a prophane Word , afore him : ' Tis Poyson .
Gentle Son , good morrow ,
And to your Friend there .
What is he , is with you ?
An Heritick , that I did bring along ,
In hope , Sir , to convert him .
Son , I doubt
Yo'are covetous , that thus you meet your time
I ' the just Point : prevent your day , at morning .
This argues something , worthy of a fear
Of importune , and carnal Appetite .
Take heed , you do not cause the Blessing leave you ,
With your ungover n 'd haste .
I should be sorry
To see my Labours , now e 'en at perfection ,
Got by long watching , and large patience ,
Not prosper , where my love and zeal hath plac 'd 'em .
Which ( Heaven I call to witness , with your self ,
To whom I have pour 'd my thoughts ) in all my ends ,
Have look 'd no way , but unto publick Good ,
To pious Uses , and dear Charity ,
Now grown a Prodigy with Men .
Wherein
If you , my Son , should now prevaricate ,
And , to your own particular Lusts , employ
So Great and Catholick a Bliss , be sure ,
A Curse will follow , yea , and overtake
Your subtle and most secret way .
I know , Sir ,
You shall not need to fear me .
I but come ,
To ha' you confute this Gentleman .
Who is ,
Indeed , Sir , somewhat caustive of belief
Toward your Stone : would not be gull 'd .
Well , Son ,
All that I can convince him in , is this ,
The work is done : Bright Sol is in his Robe .
We have a Med'cine of the triple Soul ,
The glorified Spirit .
Thanks be to Heaven ,
And make us worthy of it .
Ulen spiegel .
Anon , Sir . Sub .
Look well to the Register ,
And let your heat still lessen by degrees ,
To the Aludels .
Yes , Sir . Sub .
Did you look
O' the Bolts-head yet ?
Which , on D.
Sir ?
What 's the Complexion ?
Infuse Vinegar ,
To draw his volatile substance , and his Tincture :
And let the Water in Glass E.
be feltred ,
And put into the Gripes egg .
Lute him well ;
And leave him clos 'd in Balneo .
I will , Sir .
What a brave Language here is ?
next to canting ?
I ' have another work , you never saw , Son ,
That three days since past the Philosophers wheel ,
In the lent heat of Athanor ; and 's become
Sulpher o'Nature .
But 'tis for me ?
What
need you ?
You have enough , in that is perfect .
Mam ! O , but ?
Why , this is covetise ! Mam .
No, I assure you ,
I shall employ it all in pious uses ,
Founding of Colledges , and Grammar Schools ,
Marrying young Virgins , building Hospitals ,
And now , and then , a Church .
How now ?
Sir , please you ,
Shall I not change the feltre ?
Marry , yes .
And bring me the Complexion of Glass B.
Ha' you another ?
Yes , Son , were I assur 'd
Your piety were firm , we would not want
The means to glorifie it .
But I hope the best :
I mean to tinct C.
in Sand-heat , to morrow ,
And give him Imbibition .
Of white Oyl ?
No, Sir , of red .
is come over the Helm too ,
I thank my Maker , in S.
Maries Bath ,
And shews Lac Virginis .
Blessed be Heaven .
I sent you of his f?ces there calcin 'd .
Out of that Calx , I ' ha' won the Salt of Mercury ,
By powring on your rectified water ?
Yes , and reverberating in Athanor .
How now ?
What colour says it ?
The ground
black , Sir .
That 's your Crowes head ?
Your Cocks-comb 's , is't not ?
No, 'tis not perfect , would it were the Crow .
That work wants something .
( O , I look 'd for this .
The Hay is a pitching . )
Are you sure , you loos 'd 'em
I ' their own menstrue ?
Yes , Sir , and then married 'em ,
And put 'em in a Bolts-head , nipp 'd to digestion ,
According as you bade me , when I set
The Liquor of Mars to Circulation ,
In the same heat .
The process , then , was right .
Yes , by the token , Sir , the Retort brake ,
And what was sav 'd , was put into the Pellicane ,
And sign 'd with Hermes Seal .
I think 'twas so .
We should have a new Amalgama .
O , this Ferret
Is rank as any Pole-cat . )
But I care not .
Let him e 'en dye ; we have enough beside ,
In Embrion .
ha 's his white shirt on ?
Yes , Sir ,
He 's ripe for inceration : He stands warm ,
In his Ash-fire .
I would not , you should let
Any dye now , if I might counsel , Sir ,
For lucks sake to the rest .
It is not good .
Mam : He says right .
I , are you bolted ?
Nay , I know't , Sir ,
I ' have seen th'ill Fortune .
What is some three Ounces
Of fresh materials ?
Is't no more ?
No more , Sir ,
Of Gold , t ' Amalgame , with some six of Mercury .
Away , here 's Money .
What will serve ?
Ask him , Sir .
How much ?
Give him Nine pound : you
may gi' him Ten .
Yes , Twenty , and be cozen 'd , do .
There 'tis .
This needs not .
But that you will have it so ,
To see conclusions of all .
For two
Of our inferiour Works , are at fixation .
A third is in ascension .
Go your ways .
Ha' you set the Oil of Luna in Kemia ?
Yes , Sir . Sub .
And the Philosophers Vinegar .
We shall have a Sallad .
When do you
make Projection ?
Son , be not hasty , I exalt our Med'cine ;
By hanging him in Balneo vaporoso ,
And giving him solution ; then congeal him ;
And then dissolve him ; then again congeal him ;
For look , how oft I iterate the Work ,
So many times I add unto his Vertue .
F f As ,
As , if at first one Ounce covert a hundred ,
After his second loose , he 'll turn a thousand ;
His third solution , ten ; his fourth , a hundred .
After his fifth , a thousand thousand Ounces
Of any imperfect Metal , into pure
Silver or Gold , in all Examinations ,
As good as any of the natural Mine .
Get you your Stuff here against Afternoon ,
Your Brass , your Pewter , and your Andirons .
Not those of Iron ?
Yes , you may bring them too .
We 'll change all Metals .
I believe you in that .
Then I may send my Spits ?
Yes , and your Racks .
And Dripping-pans , and Pot-hangers , and Hooks ?
Shall he not ?
If he please .
To be an Ass .
How , Sir !
This Gent 'man you must bear withal :
I told you , he had no Faith .
And little Hope , Sir ;
But much less Charity , should I gull my self .
Why , what have you observ 'd , Sir , in our Art ,
Seems so impossible ?
But your whole Work , no more .
That you should hatch Gold in a Furnace , Sir ,
As they do Eggs in Egypt ! Sub .
Sir , do you
Believe that Eggs are hatch 'd so ?
If I should ?
Why , I think that the greater Miracle .
No Egg but differs from a Chicken more
Than Metals in themselves .
That cannot be .
The Egg 's ordain 'd by Nature to that end ,
And is a Chicken in potentia .
The same we say of Lead , and other Metals ,
Which would be Gold , if they had time .
And that
Our Art doth further .
I , for 'twere absurd
To think that Nature in the Earth bred Gold
Perfect i' the instant .
Something went before .
There must be remote Matter .
I , what is that ?
Marry , we say ?
I , now it heats : stand Father ,
Pound him to dust ?
It is , of the one part ,
A humid Exhalation , which we call
Materia liquida , or the unctuous Water ;
On th ' other part , a certain crass and viscous
Portion of Earth ; both which , concorporate ,
Do make the Elementary Matter of Gold ;
Which is not yet propria materia ,
But commune to all Metals , and all Stones .
For , where it is forsaken of that moisture ,
And hath more driness , it becomes a Stone ;
Where it retains more of the humid fatness ,
It turns to Sulpher , or to Quicksilver ,
Who are the Parents of all other Metals .
Nor can this remote Matter suddenly
Progress so from extreme unto extreme ,
As to grow Gold , and leap o 're all the Means .
Nature doth first beget th ' imperfect , then
Proceeds she to the perfect .
Of that aiery
And oily Water , Mercury is engendred ;
Sulpher o ' the fat and earthy part ; the one
( Which is the last ) supplying the place of Male ,
The other of the Female , in all Metals .
Some do believe Hermaphrodeity ,
That both do act and suffer .
But these two
Make the rest ductile , malleable , extensive .
And even in Gold they are ; for we do find
Seeds of them , by our Fire , and Gold in them ;
And can produce the species of each Metal
More perfect thence , than Nature doth in Earth .
Beside , who doth not see , in daily practice ,
Art can beget Bees , Hornets , Beetles , Wasps ,
Out of the Carcasses and Dung of Creatures ;
Yea , Scorpions of an Herb , being rightly plac 'd ?
And these are living Creatures , far more perfect
And excellent than Metals .
Well said , Father !
Nay , if he take you in hand , Sir , with an Argument ,
He 'll bray you in a Mortar .
Pray you , Sir , stay .
Rather than I 'll be bray 'd , Sir , I 'll believe
That Alchemy is a pretty kind of Game ,
Somewhat like Tricks o ' the Cards , to cheat a Man
With charming .
Sir ?
What else are all your Terms ,
Whereon no one o ' your Writers 'grees with other ?
Of your Elixir , your Lac virginis ,
Your Stone , your Med'cine , and your Chrysosperme ,
Your Sal , your Sulpher , and your Mercury ,
Your Oil of Height , your Tree of Life , your Blood ,
Your Marchesite , your Tutie , your Magnesia ,
Your Toade , your Crow , your Dragon , and your Panthar ,
Your Sun , your Moon , your Firmament , your Adrop ,
Your Lato , Azoch , Zernich , Chibrit , Heautarit ,
And then your Red Man , and your White Woman ,
With all your Broths , your Menstrues , and Materials ,
Of Piss and Egg-shells , Womens Terms , Mans Blood ,
Hair o ' th ' Head , burnt Clouts , Chalk , Merds , and Clay ,
Powder of Bones , Scalings of Iron , Glass ,
And Worlds of other strange Ingredients ,
Would burst a Man to name ?
And all these , nam 'd ,
Intending but one thing ; which Art our Writers
Us 'd to obscure their Art .
Sir , so I told him ,
Because the simple Idiot should not learn it ,
And make it vulgar .
Was not all the Knowledge
Of the ?gyptians writ in mystick Symbols ?
Speak not the Scriptures oft in Parables ?
Are not the choicest Fables of the Poets ,
That were the Fountains and first Springs of Wisdom ,
Wrapt in perplexed Allegories ?
I urg 'd that ,
And clear 'd to him , that Sysiphus was damn 'd
To roll the ceasless Stone , only because
He would have ours common .
Who is this ?
God 's precious ?
What do you mean ?
Go in , good Lady ,
Let me intreat you .
Where 's this Varlet ?
Sir ?
You very Knave ! do you use me thus ?
Wherein , Sir ?
Go in , and see , you Traitor .
Who is it , Sir ?
Nothing , Sir : Nothing .
What 's the matter , good Sir ?
I have not seen you thus distemper 'd .
Who is't ?
All Arts have still had , Sir , their Adversaries ;
But ours the most ignorant .
What now ?
' Twas not my fault , Sir ; she would speak with you .
Would she , Sir ?
Follow me .
Stay , Lungs .
I dare not , Sir .
How ! Pray thee stay .
She 's mad , Sir , and sent hither ? ?
Stay Man , what is she ?
A Lords Sister , Sir .
( He 'll be mad too .
I warrant thee . )
Why sent hither ?
Sir , to be cur 'd .
Why Rascal !
Loe you .
Here , Sir .
' Fore God , a Bradamante , a brave Piece .
Heart , this is a Bawdy-house ! I 'll be burnt else .
O , by this Light , no .
Do not wrong him .
H'is
Too scrupulous that way .
It is his Vice .
No, h ' is a rare Physician , do him right ,
An excellent Paracelsian , and has done
Strange Cures with Mineral Physick .
He deals all
With Spirits , he .
He will not hear a word
Of Galen , or his tedious Recipe 's .
How now , Lungs !
Softly , Sir , speak softly .
I meant
To ha' told your VVorship all .
This must not hear .
No, he will not be gull 'd : let him alone .
Y'are very right , Sir , she is a most rare Scholar ,
And is gone mad with studying Braughton 's VVorks .
If you but name a word touching the Hebrew ,
She falls into her Fit , and will discourse
So learnedly of Genealogies ,
As you would run mad too , to hear her , Sir .
How might one do t ' have conference with her , Lungs ?
O ,
O , divers have run mad upon the conference .
I do not know , Sir : I am sent in haste ,
To fetch a Viol .
Be not gull 'd , Sir Mammon .
Wherein ?
'Pray ye , be patient .
Yes , as you are ,
And trust confederate Knaves , and Bawds , and Whores .
You are too foul , believe it .
Come here , Ulen ,
One word .
I dare not , in good faith .
Stay , knave .
H' is extream angry that you saw her , Sir .
Drink that .
What is she when she 's out of her fit ?
O , the most affablest creature , sir ! so merry !
So pleasant ! she 'll mount you up , like Quick-silver ,
Over the Helm ; and circulate , like Oyl ,
A very Vegetal : Discourse of State ,
Of Mathematicks , Bawdry , any thing ?
Is she no way accessible ?
no means ,
No trick , to give a man a taste of her ? ?
wit ?
Or so ?
?
I 'll come to you again , Sir .
Surly , I did not think , one o'your breeding
Would traduce Personages of worth .
Sir Epicure ,
Your friend to use : yet , still , loth to be gull 'd .
I do not like your Philosophical Bawds .
Their Stone is Letchery enough to pay for ,
Without this Bait .
' Heart , you abuse your self .
I know the Lady , and her Friends , and Means ,
The Original of this Disaster .
Her brother
H'as told me all .
And yet you ne 're saw her
Till now ?
O , yes , bur I forgot .
I have ( believe it )
One o ' the treacherousest memories , I do think ,
Of all mankind .
What call you her brother ?
My Lord ? ? ?
He wi' not have his Name known , now I think on't .
A very treacherous memory ! Mam .
O' my faith ?
Tut , if you ha' it not about you , pass it ,
Till we meet next .
Nay , by this hand , 'tis true .
He 's one I honour , and my Noble Friend ,
And I respect his house .
Heart ! can it be ,
That a grave Sir , a rich , that has no need ,
A wise Sir too , at other times , should thus
With his own Oaths , and Arguments , make hard means
To gull himself ?
And this be your Elixir ,
Your lapis mineralis , and your lunary ,
Give me your honest trick , yet , at Primero ,
Or Gleek ; and take your lutum sapientis ,
Your menstruum simplex : I 'll have Gold before you ,
And with less danger of the Quick-silver ,
Or the hot Sulphur .
Here 's one from Captain Face , Sir ,
Desires you meet him i' the Temple-Church ,
Some half hour hence , and upon earnest business .
Sir , if you please to quit us , now ; and come
Again within two hours , you shall have
My Master busie examining o ' the works ;
And I will steal you in unto the party ,
That you may see her converse .
Sir , shall I say ,
You 'll meet the Captains Worship ?
Sir , I will .
But , by Attorny , and to a second purpose .
Now , I am sure , it is a Bawdy-house ;
I 'll swear it , were the Marshal here to thank me :
The naming this Commander doth confirm it .
Don Face ! Why , h ' is the most authentick Dealer
I ' these commodities ! The Superintendent
To all the quainter Traffickers in Town .
He is their Visitor , and does appoint ,
Who lies with whom , and at what hour ; what price ;
VVhich Gown ; and in what Smock ; what Fall ; what Tyre .
Him will I prove , by a third person , to find
The Subtilties of this dark Labyrinth :
VVhich , if I do discover , dear Sir Mammon ,
You 'll give your poor friend leave , tho no Philosopher ,
To laugh : for you that are , 'tis thought , shall weep.
Sir , He does pray , you 'll not forget .
I will not , Sir .
Sir Epicure , I shall leave you ?
I follow you , straight .
But do so , good Sir , to avoid suspicion .
This Gent 'man has a par 'lous head .
But wilt thou , Ulen ,
Be constant to thy promise ?
As my life , Sir .
And wilt thou insinuate what I am ?
and praise me ?
And say , I am a noble Fellow ?
O , what else , Sir ?
And , that you 'll make her royal , with the Stone ,
An Empress ; and your self King of Bantam .
Wilt thou do this ?
Will I , Sir ?
Lungs , my Lungs !
I love thee .
Send your stuff , Sir , that my Master
May busie himself about projection .
Th' hast witch 'd me , Rogue : Take , go .
Your Jack , and all , Sir .
Thou art a Villain ?
I will send my Jack ,
And the Weights too .
Slave , I could bite thine Ear .
Away , thou dost not care for me .
Not I , Sir ?
Come , I was born to make thee , my good weasel ,
Set thee on a bench , and ha' thee twirl a Chain
With the best Lords Vermine of 'em all .
Away , Sir .
A Count , nay , a Count-Palatine ? ?
Good Sir , go .
Shall not advance thee better : no , nor faster .
Has he bit ?
And swallow 'd too , my Subtle .
I ha' giv'n him Line , and now he plays , yfaith .
And shall we twitch him ?
Thorow both the Gills .
A wench is a rare bait , with which a man
No sooner 's taken , but he straight firks mad .
Dol , my Lord Wha'ts 'hums Sister , you must now
Bear your self statelich .
O , let me alone .
I 'll not forget my Race , I warrant you .
I 'll keep my distance , laugh , and talk aloud ;
Have all the tricks of a proud scurvy Lady ,
And be as rude as her woman .
Well said , Sanguine .
But will he send his Andirons ?
His Jack too ;
And 's Iron shooing-horn : I ha' spoken to him .
Well ,
I must not lose my wary Gamester , yonder .
O Monsieur Caution , that will not be gull 'd ?
I , if I can strike a fine hook into him , now ,
The Temple-Church , there I have cast mine Angle .
Well , pray for me .
I 'll about it .
What , more Gudgeons !
Dol , scout , scout ; stay , Face , you must go to the door :
'Pray God it be my Anabaptist .
Who is't , Dol ?
I know him not .
He looks like a Gold-end-man .
Gods so ! 'tis he , he said he would send .
What call you him ?
The sanctified Elder , that should deal
For Mammon 's Jack and Andirons ! Let him in .
Stay , help me off , first , with my Gown .
Away
Madam , to your withdrawing Chamber .
Now ,
In a new tune , new gesture , but old language ,
This fellow is sent from one negotiates with me
About the Stone too ; for the holy Brethren
Of Amsterdam , the exil 'd Saints : that hope
To raise their Discipline by it .
I must use him
In some strange fashion , now , to make him admire me .
Take away the Recipient ,
And rectifie your Menstrue from the Phlegma .
Then pour it o ' the Sol , in the Cucurbite ,
And let 'em macerate together .
Yes , Sir .
And save the ground ?
Terra damnata
Must not have entrance in the work .
Who are you ?
A faithful Brother , if it please you .
What 's that ?
A Lullianist ?
a Ripley ?
Filius artis ?
Can you sublime and dulcifie ?
calcine ?
Know you the Sapor Pontick ?
Sapor Styptick ?
Or what is homogene , or heterogene ?
I understand no Heathen language , truly .
Heathen , you Knipper-Doling ?
Is Ars Sacra ,
Or Chrysop ?ia ,
or Spagyrica ,
Or the Pamphysick , or Panarchick knowledge ,
A Heathen language ?
Heathen Greek , I take it .
How ?
Heathen Greek ?
All 's Heathen but the Hebrew .
Sirrah , my Varlet , stand you forth , and speak to him ,
Like a Philosopher : Answer i' the language .
Name the Vexations , and the Martyrizations
Of Metals in the work .
Sir , Putrefaction ,
Solution , Ablution , Sublimation ,
Cohobation , Calcination , Ceration , and
This is Heathen Greek , to you , now ?
And when comes Vivification ?
After Mortification .
What 's Cohobation ?
' Tis the pouring on
Your Aqua Regis , and then drawing him off ,
To the Trine Circle of the Seven Sphears .
What 's the proper passion of Metals ?
What 's your ultimum supplicium auri ?
This 's Heathen Greek to you ?
And what 's your Mercury ?
A very fugitive , he will be gone , Sir .
How know you him ?
By his Viscositie ,
His Oleosity , and his Suscitability .
How do you sublime him ?
With the calce of Egg-shells ,
White Marble , Chalk .
Your Magisterium , now ?
What 's that ?
Shifting , Sir , your Elements ,
Dry into cold , cold into moist , moist in-
to hot , hot into dry .
That 's Heathen Greek to you still ?
Your Lapis Philosophicus ?
' Tis a Stone , and not
A Stone ; a Spirit , a Soul , and a Body :
Which if you do dissolve , it is dissolv 'd ;
If you coagulate , it is coagulated ;
If you make it to fly , it flieth .
This 's Heathen Greek to you ?
What are you , Sir ?
Please you , a servant of the Exil 'd Brethren ,
That deal with Widows , and with Orphans Goods ;
And make a just account unto the Saints :
A Deacon .
O , you are sent from Master Wholsome ,
Your Teacher ?
From Tribulation Wholsome ,
Our very zealous Pastor .
I have
Some Orphans Goods to come here .
Of what kind , Sir ?
Pewter , and Brass , Andirons , and Kitchin-ware ,
Metals , that we must use our Med'cine on :
Wherein the Brethren may have a penn'orth ,
For ready money .
Were the Orphans Parents
Sincere Professors ?
Why do you ask ?
Because
We then are to deal justly , and give ( in truth )
Their utmost value .
' Slid , you 'ld cozen else ,
And if their Parents were not of the faithful ?
I will not trust you , now I think on't ,
Till I ha' talk 'd with your Pastor .
Ha' you brought money
To buy more Coals ?
No, surely .
No ?
How so ?
The Brethren bid me say unto you , Sir ,
Surely , they will not venture any more ,
Till they may see projection .
How ! Ana .
Yo ' have had ,
For the Instruments , as Bricks , and Lome , and Glasses ,
Already thirty pound ; and for Materials ,
They say , some ninety more : And they have heard since ,
That one , at Heidelberg , made it of an Egg .
And a small paper of Pin-dust .
What 's your Name ?
My Name is Ananias .
Out , the Varlet
That cozen 'd the Apostles ! Hence , away ,
Flee Mischief ; had your holy Consistory
No Name to send me , of another sound ,
Than wicked Ananias ?
send your Elders
Hither , to make attonement for you , quickly ,
And gi' me satisfaction ; or outgoes
The fire : and down th ' Alembeks , and the fornace .
Piger Henricus , or what not .
Thou wretch ,
Both Sericon , and Bufo , shall be lost ,
Tell 'em .
All hope of rooting out the Bishops ,
Or th ' Antichristian Hierarchy shall perish ,
If they stay threescore minutes .
The Aqueity ,
Terreity , and Sulphureity
Shall run together again , and all be annull 'd ,
Thou wicked Ananias .
This will fetch 'em ,
And make 'em haste towards their gulling more .
A man must deal like a rough Nurse , and fright
Those that are froward to an appetite .
How now ! What mates ?
What Baiards ha'
we here ?
I told you , he would be furious .
Sir , here 's Nab ,
Has brought you another piece of Gold to look on :
( We must appease him .
Give it me ) and prays you ,
You would devise ( what is it Nab ? )
A sign , Sir .
I , a good lucky one , a thriving sign , Doctor .
I was devising now .
( Slight , do not say so ,
He will repent he ga' you any more . )
What say you to his Constellation , Doctor ?
The Ballance ?
No, that way is stale , and common .
A Townsman born in Taurus , gives the Bull ;
Or the Bulls-head : In Aries , the Ram .
A poor device .
No, I will have his Name
Form 'd in some mystick Character ; whose Radii ,
Striking the Senses of the passers by ,
Shall , by a virtual influence , breed affections ,
That may result upon the party owns it :
As thus ?
Nab !
He first shall have a Bell , that 's Abel ;
And by it standing one whose Name is Dee ,
In a Rug Gown ; there 's D , and Rug , that 's Drug !
And right anenst him a Dog snarling Er ;
There 's Drugger , Abel Drugger .
That 's his sign .
And here 's now Mystery , and Hieroglyphick !
Abel , thou art made .
Sir , I do thank his Worship .
Six o'thy legs more will not do it , Nab .
He has brought you a Pipe of Tobacco , Doctor .
Yes , Sir :
I have another thing I would impart ?
Out with it , Nab .
Sir , there is lodg 'd , hard by me
A rich young Widow ?
Good ! a bona roba ?
But Nineteen at the most .
Very good , Abel .
Marry , sh'is not in fashion yet ; she wears
A hood ; but 't stands acop .
No matter , Abel .
And I do now and then give her a fucus ?
What ! dost thou deal , Nab ?
I did tell you , Captain .
And Physick too sometime , Sir : for which she trusts me
With all her mind .
She 's come up here of purpose
To learn the Fashion .
Good ( his match too! ) on , Nab .
And she do 's strangely long to know her fortune .
Gods lid , Nab , send her to the Doctor hither .
Yes , I have spoke to her of his Worship already :
But she 's afraid it will be blown abroad ,
And hurt her Marriage .
Hurt it ?
' Tis the way
To heal it , if 'twere hurt ; to make it more
Follow 'd and sought : Nab , thou shalt tell her this .
She 'll be more known , more talk 'd of ; and your Widows
Are ne 'er of any price till they be famous ;
Their Honour is their multitude of Suitors :
Send her , it may be thy good fortune .
What ?
Thou dost not know .
No, Sir , she 'll never marry
Under a Knight .
Her Brother has made a Vow .
What , and dost thou dispair , my little Nab ,
Knowing what the Doctor has set down for thee ,
And seeing so many of the City dubb 'd ?
One Glass o ' thy water , with a Madam , I know
Will have it done , Nab .
What 's her Brother ?
a Knight ?
No, Sir , a Gentleman newly warm in 'his land , Sir ,
Scarce cold in his one and twenty , that do 's govern
His Sister here ; and is a man himself
Of some three thousand a year , and is come up
To learn to quarrel , and to live by his Wits ,
And will go down again , and die i' the Countrey .
How ! to quarrel ?
Yes , Sir , to carry Quarrels ,
As Gallants do , and manage 'em by Line .
' Slid , Nab ! The Doctor is the only man
In Christendom for him .
He has made a Table ,
VVith Mathematical Demonstrations ,
Touching the Art of Quarrels .
He will give him
An Instrument to quarrel by .
Go , bring 'em both ,
Him and his Sister .
And , for thee , with her
The Doctor happ'ly may perswade .
Go to .
' Shat give his VVorship a new Damask Suit
Upon the premisses .
O , good Captain .
He shall ,
He is the honestest fellow , Doctor .
Stay not ,
No Offers , bring the Damask , and the Parties .
I 'll try my power , Sir .
And thy will too , Nab .
' Tis good Tobacco , this ! what is't an Ounce ?
He 'll send you a pound , Doctor .
O , no .
He will do 't .
It is the goodest Soul .
Abel , about it .
( Thou shalt know more anon .
Away , be gone . )
A miserable Rogue , and lives with Cheese ,
And has the worms .
That was the Cause indeed
VVhy he came now .
He dealt with me in private ,
To get a Med'cine for 'em .
And shall , Sir . This works .
A wife , a wife for one on'us , my dear Subtle :
VVe 'll e 'ne draw lots , and he that fails , shall have
The more in Goods , the other has in Tail .
Rather the less .
For she may be so light
She may want Grains .
I , or be such a burden ,
A man would scarce endure her for the whole .
Faith , best let 's see her first , and then determine .
But Dol must ha' no breath on't .
Away , you to your Surly yonder , catch him .
'Pray God I ha' not staid too long .
I fear it .
And such rebukes we of the separation
Must bear , with willing shoulders , as the trials
Sent forth to tempt our frailties .
In pure Zeal
I do not like the man , He is a Heathen ,
And speaks the Language of Canaan , truly .
I think him a prophane person indeed .
He bears
The visible mark of the Beast in his fore-head .
And for his stone , it is a work of darkness ,
And with Philosophy blinds the eyes of man .
Good Brother , we must bend unto all means
That may give furtherance to the holy Cause .
Which his cannot : The sanctified Cause
Should have a sanctified Course .
Not always necessary :
The Children of Perdition are oft-times
Made Instruments even of the greatest works .
Beside , we should give somewhat to mans nature ,
The place he lives in , still about the fire ,
And fume of Metals , that intoxicate
The brain of man , and make him prone to Passion .
Where have you greater Atheists than your Cooks ?
Or more prophane , or cholerick , than your Glass-men ?
More Antichristian than your Bell-founders ?
What makes the Devil so devillish , I would ask you ,
Sathan , our common Enemy , but his being
Perpetually about the fire , and boiling
Brimstone and Arsnick ?
We must give , I say ,
Unto the motives , and the stirrers up
Of Humors in the blood .
It may be so .
When as the work is done , the stone is made ,
This heat of his may turn into a Zeal ,
And stand up for the beauteous discipline ,
Against the menstruous Cloth , and Rag of Rome .
We must await his calling , and the coming
Of the good Spirit .
You did fault , t 'upbraid him
With the Brethrens blessing of Heidelberg , weighing
What need we have to hasten on the work ,
For the restoring of the silenc 'd Saints ,
Which ne 'er will be , but by the Philosophers Stone .
And so a learned Elder , one of Scotland ,
Assur 'd me ; Aurum potabile being
The only Med'cine , for the civil Magistrate ,
T'incline him to a feeling of the Cause ;
And must be daily us 'd in the Disease .
I have not edified more , truly , by Man ;
Not since the beautiful light first shone on me :
And I am sad my Zeal hath so offended .
Let us call on him then .
The motion 's good ,
And of the Spirit ; I will knock first : Peace be within .
' Twas time .
Your threescore minutes
Were at last thread , you see ; and down had gone
Furnus acedi? , Turris circulatorius :
Lembek , Bolts-head , Retort , and Pellicane
Had all been cinders .
Wicked Ananias !
Art thou return 'd ?
Nay then , it goes down yet .
Sir , be appeased , he is come to humble
Himself in Spirit , and to ask your patience ,
If too much Zeal hath carried him aside
From the due path .
Why , this doth qualifie !
The Brethren had no purpose , verily ,
To give you the least Grievance : but are ready
To lend their willing hands to any project
The Spirit and you direct .
This qualifies more !
And for the Orphans Goods , let them be valu 'd ,
Or what is needful else to the holy work ,
It shall be numbred ; here , by me , the Saints
Throw down their Purse before you .
This qualifies most !
Why , thus it should be , now you understand .
Have I discours 'd so unto you of our Stone ,
And of the good that it shall bring your Cause ?
Shew 'd you , ( beside the main of hiring Forces
Abroad , drawing the Hollanders , your Friends ,
From th ' Indies , to serve you , with all their Fleet )
That even the med'cinal use shall make you a Faction ,
And Party in the Realm ?
As , put the case ,
That some great man in State , he have the Gout ,
Why , you but send three drops of your Elixir ,
You help him straight : there you have made a friend .
Another has the Palsie , or the Dropsie ,
He takes of your incombustible stuff ,
He 's young again : there you have made a friend .
A Lady that is past the feat of body ,
Tho not of mind , and hath her Face decay 'd
Beyond all cure of Paintings , you restore
With the Oyl of Talek ; there you have made a friend :
And all her friends .
A Lord that is a Leper ,
A Knight that has the Bone-ach , or a Squire
That hath both these , you make 'em smooth and sound ,
With a bare fricace of your Med'cine : still
You increase your friends .
I , 'tis very pregnant .
And then the turning of this Lawyer 's Pewter
To Plate at Christmass ? ?
Christ-tide , I pray you .
Yet Ananias ?
I have done .
Or changing
His parcel gilt to massie Gold .
You cannot
But raise your friends .
Withal , to be of power
To pay an Army in the field , to buy
The King of France out of his Realms , or Spain
Out of his Indies .
What can you not do
Against Lords spiritual or temporal ,
That shall oppone you ?
Verily 'tis true .
We may be temporal Lords our selves , I take it .
You may be any thing , and leave off to make
Long-winded Exercises : or suck up
Your ha , and hum , in a tune .
I not deny ,
But such as are not graced in a State ,
May , for their Ends , be adverse in Religion ,
And get a tune to call the Flock together :
For ( to say sooth ) a tune does much with women ,
And other phlegmatick people , it is your Bell .
Bells are prophane : a tune may be religious .
No warning with you ?
Then farewel my patience .
' Slight , it shall down : I will not be thus tortur 'd .
I pray you , Sir .
All shall perish .
I have spoke it .
Let me find Grace , Sir , in your eyes ; the man
He stands corrected : neither did his zeal
( But as your self ) allow a tune somewhere .
Which now being to 'ard the Stone , we shall not need .
No, nor your holy Vizard , to win widows
To give you Legacies ; or make zealous wives
To rob their husbands for the Common Cause :
Nor take the start of Bonds broke but one day ,
And say , they were forfeited by Providence .
Nor shall you need o 're night to eat huge meals ,
To celebrate your next days Fast the better :
The whilst the Brethren and the Sisters humbled ,
Abate the stiffness of the flesh .
Nor cast
Before your hungry Hearers scrupulous Bones ;
As whether a Christian may hawk or hunt ,
Or whether Matrons of the Holy Assembly
May lay their Hair out , or wear Doublets ;
Or have that Idol Starch about their Linnen .
It is indeed an Idol .
Mind him not , Sir .
I do command thee , Spirit ( of zeal , but trouble )
To peace within him .
Pray you , Sir , go on .
Nor shall you need to libel 'gainst the Prelates ,
And shorten so your Ears against the hearing
Of the next wire-drawn Grace .
Nor of necessity
Rail against Plays , to please the Alderman ,
Whose daily Custard you devour .
Nor lie
With zealous Rage till you are hoarse .
Not one
Of these so singular Arts .
Nor call your selves
By Names of Tribulation , Persecution ,
Restraint , Long-Patience , and such like affected
By the whole family , or wood of you ,
Only for Glory , and to catch the Ear
Of the Disciple .
Truly , Sir , they are
Ways that the Godly Brethren have invented
For propagation of the Glorious Cause ,
As very notable means , and whereby also
Themselves grow soon , and profitably famous .
O , but the Stone , all 's idle to't ! nothing !
The Art of Angels , Natures Miracle ,
The Divine Secret that doth fly in Clouds
From East to West ; and whose tradition
Is not from Men , but Spirits .
I hate Traditions :
I do not trust them ?
They are Popish , all .
I will not peace .
I will not ?
Ananias !
Please the prophane , to grieve the godly : I may not .
Well , Ananias , thou shalt over-come .
It is an ignorant zeal that haunts him , Sir .
But truly , else , a very faithful Brother ,
A Botcher : and a man , by revelation ,
That hath a competent knowledge of the truth .
Has he a competent sum there i' the Bag
To buy the Goods within ?
I am made Guardian ,
And must , for Charity and Conscience sake ,
Now see the most be made for my poor Orphan :
Tho I desire the Brethren too , good Gainers .
There they are within .
When you have view 'd , and
bought 'em .
And tane the Inventory of what they are ,
They are ready for Projection ; there 's no more
To do : Cast on the Med'cine , so much Silver
As there is Tin there , so much Gold as Brass ,
I 'll gi' it you in by weight .
But how long time ,
Sir , must the Saints expect yet ?
Let me see ,
How 's the Moon now ?
Eight , nine , ten days hence
He will be Silver Potate ; then three days
Before he Citronise : some fifteen days
The Magisterium will be perfected .
About the second day of the third week ,
In the ninth month ?
Yes , my good Ananias .
What will the Orphans Goods arise to , think you ?
Some hundred Marks , as much as fill 'd three Cars ,
Unladed now : you 'll make six Millions of 'em .
But I must ha' more Coals laid in .
How ! Sub .
Another Load ,
And then we have finish 'd .
We must now increase
Our fire to Ignis ardens , we are past
Fimus equinus , Balnei Cineris ,
And all those lenter heats .
If the holy Purse
Should with this draught fall low , and that the Saints
Do need a present sum , I have a trick
To
To melt the Pewter , you shall buy now , instantly ,
And with a tincture make you as good Dutch Dollars
As any are in Holland .
Can you so ?
I , and shall 'bide the third Examination .
It will be joyful tidings to the Brethren .
But you must carry it secret .
I , but stay ,
This act of coyning , is it lawful ?
Lawful ?
We know no Magistrate .
Or , if we did ,
This 's forreign Coin .
It is no coining , Sir .
It is but casting .
Ha ?
you distinguish well .
Casting of Money may be lawful .
' Tis , Sir .
Truly , I take it so .
There is no scruple ,
Sir , to be made of it ; believe Ananias :
This Case of Conscience he is studied in .
I 'll make a question of it to the Brethren .
The Brethren shall approve it lawful , doubt not .
Where shall it be done ?
( Knock without .
For that we 'll talk anon .
There 's some to speak with me .
Go in , I pray you ,
And view the parcels .
That 's the Inventory .
I 'll come to you straight .
Who is it ?
Face ! Appear .
Good Prize ?
Good Pox ! Yond ' caustive Cheater
Never came on .
How then ?
I ha' walk 'd the round
Till now , and no such thing .
And ha' you quit him ?
Quit him ?
an hell would quit him too , he were happy .
' Slight would you have me stalk like a Mill-Jade ,
All day , for one that will not yield us Grains ?
I know him of old .
O , but to ha' gull 'd him ,
Had been a maistry .
Let him go , black Boy ,
And turn thee , that some fresh news may possess thee .
A Noble Count , a Don of Spain ( my dear
Delicious Compeer , and my Party-bawd )
Who is come hither , private for his Conscience ,
And brought Munition with him , six great Sloops ,
Bigger than three Dutch Hoys , beside round trunks ,
Furnish 'd with Pistolets , and Pieces of Eight ,
Will streight be here , my Rogue , to have thy Bath ,
( That is the colour ) and to make his Battry
Upon our Dol , our Castle , our Cinque-Port ,
Our Dover Pire , our what thou wilt .
Where is she ?
She must prepare Perfumes , delicate Linnen ,
The Bath in chief , a Banquet , and her Wit ,
For she must milk his Epididymis .
Where is the Doxy ?
I 'll send her to thee :
And but dispatch my Brace of little John Leydens ,
And come again my self .
Are they within then ?
Numbring the sum .
How much ?
A hundred Marks , Boy .
Why , this 's a lucky day ! Ten pounds of Mammon !
Three o ' my Clark ! A Portague o ' my Grocer !
This o ' the Brethren ! beside Reversions ,
And States to come i' the Widow , and my Count !
My share to day will not be bought for forty ?
What ?
Pounds , dainty Dorothee , art thou so near ?
Yes , say Lord General , how fares our Camp ?
As with the few that had intrench 'd themselves
Safe , by their Discipline , against a world , Dol .
And laugh 'd within those Trenches , and grew fat
With thinking on the Booties , Dol , brought in
Daily by their small Parties .
This dear hour
A doughty Don is taken with my Dol ;
And thou maist make his Ransom what thou wilt ,
My Dousabel : He shall be brought here fetter 'd
With thy fair looks before he sees thee ; and thrown
In a Down-bed , as dark as any Dungeon ;
Where thou shalt keep him waking with thy Drum ;
Thy Drum , my Dol ; thy Drum ; till he be tame ,
As the poor Black-birds were i' the great Frost ,
Or Bees are with a Bason ; and so hive him
I ' the Swan-skin Coverlid , and Cambrick Sheets ,
Till he work Honey and Wax , my little Gods-gift .
What is he , General ?
An Adalantado ,
A Grande , Girl .
Was not my Dapper here yet ?
Nor my Drugger ?
A Pox on 'em ,
They are so long a furnishing ! Such Stinkards
Would not be seen upon these festival days .
How now ! ha' you done ?
They are gone .
The Sum
Is here in bank , my Face .
I would we knew
Another Chapman now would buy 'em out-right .
' Slid , Nab shall do 't against he ha' the widow ,
To furnish houshold .
Excellent well thought on .
Pray God he come .
I pray he keep away
Till our new business be o 're past .
But , Face ,
How cam 'st thou by this Secret Don ?
A Spirit
Brought me th ' intelligence in a paper here ,
As I was conjuring yonder in my Circle
For Surly , I ha' my Flies abroad .
Your Bath
Is famous , Subtle , by my means .
Sweet Dol ,
You must go tune your Virginal , no losing
O' the least time .
And do you hear ?
good action .
Firk , like a Flounder ; kiss , like a Scallop , close :
And tickle him with thy Mother-tongue .
His great
Verdugoship has not a jot of Language :
So much the easier to be cozen 'd ; my Dolly ,
He will come here in a hir 'd Coach , obscure ,
And our own Coach-man , whom I have sent as Guide ,
( One knocks .
No creature else .
Who 's that ?
It is not he !
O no , not yet this hour .
Who is't ?
Dapper ,
Your Clark .
God 's will then , Queen of Fairy ,
On with your Tyre ; and , Doctor , with your Robes .
Let 's dispatch him for God 's sake .
' Twill be long .
I warrant you , take but the Cues I give you ,
It shall be brief enough .
' Slight , here are more !
Abel , and I think the angry Boy , the Heir ,
That fain would quarrel .
And the Widow ?
No,
Not that I see .
O , Sir , you are welcome .
( I have had the most ado to win him to it )
He swears you 'll be the dearling o ' the Dice :
He never heard her Highness dote till now ( he says . )
Your Aunt has giv'n you the most gracious words
That can be thought on .
Shall I see her Grace ?
See her , and kiss her too .
What , honest Nab !
Ha 'st brought the Damask ! Nab .
No, Sir , here 's Tobacco .
' Tis well done , Nab : Thou'lt bring the Damask too ?
Yes , here 's the Gentleman , Captain , Master Kastril ,
I have brought to see the Doctor .
Where 's the widow ?
Sir , as he likes , his Sister ( he says ) shall come .
O , is it so ?
' Good time .
Is your Name Kastril , Sir ?
I , and the best of the Kastrils , I'lld be sorry else ,
By fifteen hundred a year .
Where is this Doctor ?
My mad Tobacco-boy , here , tells me of one
That can do things .
Has he any Skill ?
Wherein , Sir ?
To carry a business , manage a Quarrel fairly ,
Upon fit terms .
It seems , Sir , yo ' are but young
About the Town , that can make that a Question !
Sir , not so young , but I have heard some speech
Of the angry Boys , and seen 'em take Tobacco ;
And in his Shop : And I can take it too .
And I would fain be one of 'em , and go down
And practise i' the Countrey .
Sir , for the Duello ,
The Doctor , I assure you , shall inform you ,
To the least shadow of a hair : and shew you
An Instrument he has of his own making ,
Wherewith no sooner shall you make report
Of any Quarrel , but he will take the height on't
Most instantly , and tell in what degree
Of Safety it lies in , or Mortality .
And how it may be born , whether in a Right Line
Or a Half-Circle ; or may else be cast
Into an Angle blunt , if not acute :
All this he will demonstrate .
And then , Rules
To give and take the Lie by .
How ?
to take it ?
Yes , in Oblique he 'll shew you , or in Circle ;
But never in Diameter .
The whole Town
Study his Theoremes , and dispute them ordinarily
At the eating Academies .
But does he teach
Living by the wits too ?
Any thing whatever .
You cannot think that Subtilty but he reads it .
He made me a Captain .
I was a stark Pimp ,
Just o ' your standing , 'fore I met with him :
It i' not two months since .
I 'll tell you his method :
First , he will enter you at some Ordinary .
No, I 'll not come there .
You shall pardon me .
For why , Sir ?
There 's gaming there , and tricks .
Why , would you be
A Gallant , and not game ?
I , 'twill spend a man .
Spend you ?
It will repair you when you are spent .
How do they live by their wits there , that have vented
Six times your Fortunes ?
What , three thousand a year !
I , forty thousand .
Are there such ?
I , Sir .
And Gallants yet .
Here 's a young Gentleman
Is born to nothing , forty Marks a year ,
Which I count nothing .
He is to be initiated ,
And have a flye o ' the Doctor .
He will win you
By unresistable luck , within this fortnight ,
Enough to buy a Barony .
They will set him
Upmost at the Groom-Porters all the Christmass !
And for the whole year through at every place
Where there is play , present him with the Chair ;
The best Attendance , the best Drink ; sometimes
Two Glasses of Canary , and pay nothing ;
The purest Linnen , and the sharpest Knife ,
The Partridg next his Trencher : and somewhere
The dainty Bed , in private , with the dainty .
You shall ha' your Ordinaries bid for him ,
As Play-houses for a Poet ; and the Master
Pray him aloud to name what Dish he affects ,
Which must be butter 'd Shrimps : and those that drink
To no mouth else , will drink to his , as being
The goodly , president Mouth of all the Board .
Do you not gull one ?
'Od 's my life ! Do you think it ?
You shall have a cast Commander , ( can but get
In credit with a Glover , or a Spurrier ,
For some two pair of either 's ware , afore-hand )
Will , by most swift Posts dealing with him ,
Arrive at competent means to keep himself ,
His Punk , and naked Boy , in excellent fashion ,
And be admir 'd for't .
Will the Doctor teach this ?
He will do more , Sir , when your Land is gone ,
( As men of Spirit hate to keep Earth long )
In a vacation , when small money is stirring ,
And Ordinaries suspended till the Term ,
He 'll shew a perspective , where on one side
You shall behold the Faces and the Persons
Of all sufficient young Heirs in Town ,
Whose Bonds are currant for Commodity ;
On th ' other side , the Merchants Forms , and others ,
That without help of any second Broker ,
( Who would expect a share ) will trust such parcels .
In the third Square , the very Street , and Sign
Where the Commodity dwells , and does but wait
To be deliver 'd , be it Pepper , Sope ,
Hops , or Tobacco , Oat-meal , Woad , or Cheeses .
All which you may so handle , to enjoy
To your own use , and never stand oblig 'd .
I'faith ! Is he such a Fellow ?
Why , Nab here knows him .
And then for making Matches for rich Widows ,
Young Gentlewomen , Heirs , the fortunat 'st man !
He 's sent to , far and near , all over England ,
To have his Counsel , and to know their Fortunes .
Gods will , my Suster shall see him .
I 'll tell you , Sir ,
What he did tell me of Nab .
It 's a strange thing !
( By the way , you must eat no Cheese , Nab , it breeds
Melancholy :
And that same Melancholy breeds Worms ) but pass it ,
He told me , honest Nab , here , was ne 're at Tavern
But once in 's life ! Dru .
Truth , and no more I was not .
And then he was so sick ?
Could he tell you that too ?
How should I know it ?
In troth we had been a shooting ,
And had a piece of fat Ram-mutton to supper ,
That lay so heavy o ' my stomack ?
And he has no head
To bear any Wine ; for what with the noise o ' the Fidlers ,
And care of his Shop , for he dares keep no Servants ?
My head did so ake ? ? ?
As he was fain to be brought home ,
The Doctor told me .
And then a good old woman ?
( Yes faith , she dwells in Sea-coal-lane ) did cure me ,
With sodden Ale , and Pellitory o ' the Wall :
Cost me but two pence .
I had another sickness
Was worse than that .
I , that was with the grief
Thou took 'st for being sess 'd at eighteen pence ,
For the Water-work .
In truth , and it was like
T' have cost me almost my life .
Thy hair went off ?
Yes , Sir , 'twas done for spight .
Nay , so says the Doctor .
Pray thee , Tobacco-boy , go fetch my Suster ,
I 'll see this learned Boy before I go :
And so shall she .
Sir , he is busie now :
But if you have a Sister to fetch hither ,
Perhaps your own pains may command her sooner ;
And he by that time will be free .
I go .
Drugger , she 's thine : the Damask .
( Subtle and I
Must wrastle for her . )
Come on , Master Dapper .
You see how I turn Clients here away ,
To give your Cause dispatch .
Ha' you perform 'd
The Ceremonies were enjoyn 'd you ?
Yes , o ' the Vinegar ,
And the clean Shirt .
' Tis well : that Shirt may do you
More worship than you think .
Your Aunt 's afire ,
But that she will not shew it , t ' have a sight on you .
Ha' you provided for her Graces Servants ?
Yes , here are six score Edward Shillings .
And an old Harry 's Soveraign .
Very good .
And three James Shillings , and an Elizabeth Groat ,
Just twenty Nobles .
O , you are too just .
I would you had had the other Noble in Maries .
I have some Philip and Maries .
I , those same
Are best of all .
Where are they ?
Hark , the Doctor .
IS yet her Graces Cousin come ?
He is come .
And is he fasting ?
And hath cry 'd Hum ?
Thrice , you must answer .
And as oft Buz ?
If you have , say .
I have .
Then , to her Cuz ,
Hoping that he hath Vinegar 'd his Senses ,
As he was bid , the Fairy Queen dispenses ,
By me , this Robe , the Petticoat of Fortune ;
Which that he straight put on , she doth importune .
And though to Fortune near be her Petticoat ,
Yet nearer is her Smock , the Queen doth note :
And therefore , even of that a piece she hath sent ,
Which , being a Child , to wrap him in was rent ;
And prays him for a Scarf he now will wear it
( With as much love as then her Grace did tear it )
with a Rag .
About his Eyes , to shew he is fortunate .
And , trusting unto her to make his State ,
He 'll throw away all worldly Pelf about him ;
Which that he will perform , she doth not doubt him .
She need not doubt him , Sir . Alas , he has nothing ,
But what he will part withal as willingly ,
Upon her Graces word ( Throw away your Purse . )
As she would ask it : ( Handkerchiefs and all )
She cannot bid that thing , but he 'll obey .
( If you have a Ring about you , cast it off ,
Or a silver Seal at your Wrist ; her Grace will send
Her Fairies here to search you , therefore deal
Directly with her Highness .
If they find
That you conceal a Mite , you are undone . )
Truly , there 's all .
All what ?
My Money , truly .
Keep nothing that is transitory about you .
( Bid Dol play Musick . )
Look , the Elves are come
To pinch you , if you tell not truth .
Advise you .
O , I have a Paper with a Spur-ryal in't .
Ti , ti ,
They knew't , they say .
Ti , ti , ti , ti , he has more yet .
Ti , ti-ti-ti .
I ' the t 'other Pocket ?
Titi , titi , titi , titi , titi .
They must pinch him , or he will never confess , they say .
O , o .
Nay , pray you hold .
He is her Graces Nephew .
Ti , ti , ti ?
What care you ?
Good faith , you shall care .
Deal plainly , Sir , and shame the Fairies .
Shew
You are an Innocent .
By this good Light , I ha' nothing .
Ti , ti , ti , ti , to ta .
He does equivocate , she says ,
Ti , ti do ti , ti ti do , ti da ; and swears by the Light , when
he is blinded .
By this good Dark , I ha' nothing but a Half-crown
Of Gold , about my Wrist , that my Love gave me ;
And a Leaden Heart I wore sin' she forsook me .
I thought 'twas something .
And would you incur
Your Aunts displeasure for these Trifles ?
Come ,
I had rather you had thrown away twenty Half-crowns .
You may wear your Leaden Heart still .
How now ?
What News , Dol ?
Yonder 's your Knight , Sir Mammon .
Gods lid , we never thought of him till now .
Where is he ?
Here , hard by .
H'is at the Door .
And you are not ready now ?
Dol , get his Suit .
He must be sent back .
O , by no means .
What shall we do with this same Puffing here ,
Now he 's o ' the Spit ?
Why , lay him back a while ,
With some Device .
Ti , ti ti , ti ti ti .
Would her Grace
speak with me ?
I come .
Help , Dol .
Who 's there ?
Sir Epicure ,
My Master 's i' the way .
Please you to walk
Three or four Turns , but till his back be turn 'd ,
And I am for you .
Quickly , Dol .
Her Grace
Commends her kindly to you , Master Dapper .
I long to see her Grace .
She now is set
At Dinner in her Bed , and has sent you
From her own private Trencher , a dead Mouse ,
And a piece of Gingerbread , to be merry withal ,
And stay your Stomach , lest you faint with fasting :
Yet if you could hold out till she saw you ( she says )
It would be better for you .
Sir , he shall
Hold out , and 'twere this two Hours , for her Highness ;
I can assure you that .
We will not lose
All we ha' done ?
He must not see , nor speak
To any body , till then .
For that we 'll put , Sir ,
A Stay in 's Mouth .
Of what ?
Of Gingerbread .
Make you it fit .
He that hath pleas 'd her Grace
Thus far , shall not now crinkle for a little .
Gape Sir , and let him fit you .
Where shall we now
Bestow him ?
I ' the Privy .
Come along , Sir ,
I now must shew you Fortune 's Privy Lodgings .
Are they perfum 'd , and his Bath ready ?
Only the Fumigation 's somewhat strong .
Sir Epicure , I am yours , Sir , by and by .
Where 's Master ?
Now preparing for Projection , Sir .
Your Stuff will b' all chang 'd shortly .
Into Gold ?
To Gold and Silver , Sir . Mam .
Silver I care not for .
Yes , Sir , a little to give Beggars .
Where 's the Lady ?
At hand here .
I ha' told her such brave things o ' you ,
Touching your Bounty , and your noble Spirit ?
Hast thou ?
As she is almost in her Fit to see you .
But , good Sir , no Divinity i' your Conference ,
For fear of putting her in rage ?
I warrant thee .
Six Men will not hold her down .
And then
If the old Man should hear or see you ?
Fear not .
The very House , Sir , would run mad .
You know it ,
How scrupulous he is , and violent ,
' Gainst the least act of Sin .
Physick , or Mathematicks ,
Poetry , State , or Bawd 'ry ( as I told you )
She will endure , and never startle : But
No word of Controversie .
I am school 'd , good Ulen .
And you must praise her House , remember that ,
And her Nobility .
Let me alone :
No Herald , nor no Antiquary , Lungs ,
Shall do it better .
Why , this is yet
A kind of modern Happiness , to have
Dol Common for a great Lady .
Now , Epicure ,
Heighten thy self , talk to her , all in Gold ;
Rain her as many Showers as Jove did Drops
Unto his Danae : Shew the God a Miser ,
Compar 'd with Mammon .
What ?
the Stone will do 't .
She shall feel Gold , taste Gold , hear Gold , sleep Gold :
Nay , we will concumbere Gold .
I will be puissant ,
And mighty in my talk to her .
Here she comes .
To him , Dol , suckle him .
This is the noble Knight ,
I told your Ladiship ?
Madam , with your pardon ,
I kiss your Vesture .
Sir , I were uncivil
If I would suffer that ; my Lip to you , Sir .
I hope my Lord your Brother be in health , Lady .
G g Dol .
My
My Lord , my Brother is , though I no Lady , Sir .
( Well said , my Guiny-bird . )
Right noble Madam ? ?
( O , we shall have most fierce Idolatry . )
' Tis your Prerogative .
Rather your Courtesie .
Were there nought else t 'enlarge your Vertues to me ,
These Answers speak your Breeding , and your Blood .
Blood we boast none , Sir , a poor Barons Daughter .
Poor ! and gat you ?
Profane not .
Had your father
Slept all the happy remnant of his Life
Sir , although
We may be said to want the Gilt and Trapings ,
The Dress of Honour , yet we strive to keep
The Seeds and the Materials .
I do see
The old Ingredient , Vertue , was not lost ,
Nor the Drug Money us 'd to make your Compound .
There is a strange Nobility i' your Eye ,
This Lip , that Chin ! Methinks you do resemble
One o ' the Austriack Princes .
Very like ,
Her Father was an Irish Costarmonger .
The House of Valois just had such a Nose ,
And such a Forehead yet the Medici
Of Florence boast .
Troth , and I have been lik 'ned
To all these Princes .
I 'll be sworn , I heard it .
I know not how ! it is not any one ,
But e 'en the very choice of all their Features .
I 'll in , and laugh .
A certain Touch , or Air ,
That sparkles a Divinity , beyond
An earthly Beauty ! Dol .
O , you play the Courtier .
Good Lady , gi' me leave ? ?
In faith , I may not ,
To mock me , Sir . Mam .
To burn i' this sweet Flame ;
The Ph ?nix
never knew a nobler Death .
Nay , now you court the Courtier , and destroy
What you would build .
This Art , Sir , i' your words ,
Calls your whole Faith in question .
By my Soul ?
Nay Oaths are made o ' the same air , Sir . Mam .
Nature
Never bestow 'd upon Mortality
A more unblam 'd , a more harmonious Feature :
She play 'd the Step-dame in all Faces else .
Sweet Madam , le ' me be particular ? ?
Particular , Sir ?
I pray you know your Distance .
In no ill sense , sweet Lady , but to ask
How your fair Graces pass the Hours ?
I see
Yo ' are lodg 'd here , i' the House of a rare Man ,
An excellent Artist ; but what 's that to you ?
Yes , Sir ; I study here the Mathematicks ,
And Distillation .
O , I cry you pardon .
He 's a Divine Instructer , can extract
The Souls of all things by his Art ; call all
The Vertues , and the Miracles of the Sun ,
Into a temperate Furnace ; teach dull Nature
What her own Forces are .
A Man , the Emp'ror
Has courted , above Kelley ; sent his Medals
And Chains , t ' invite him .
I , and for his Physick , Sir ?
Above the Art of ?sculapius ,
That drew the Envy of the Thunderer !
I know all this , and more .
Troth , I am taken , Sir ,
Whole with these Studies , that contemplate Nature .
It is a noble Humour : But this Form
Was not intended to so dark a use .
Had you been crooked , foul , of some course Mold ,
A Cloyster had done well ; but such a Feature
That might stand up the Glory of a Kingdom ,
To live Recluse ! is a meer Sol?cism ,
Though in a Nunnery .
It must not be .
I muse , my Lord your Brother will permit it !
You should spend half my Land first , were I he .
Does not this Diamant better on my Finger ,
Than i' the Quarry ?
Why , you are like it .
You were created , Lady , for the Light !
Here , you shall wear it ; take it , the first Pledge
Of what I speak , to bind you to believe me .
In Chains of Adamant ?
Yes , the strongest Bands .
And take a Secret too .
Here , by your Side ,
Doth stand , this Hour , the happiest Man in Europe .
You are contented , Sir ?
Nay , in true being ,
The Envy of Princes , and the Fear of States .
Say you so , Sir Epicure !
Yes , and thou shalt prove it ,
Daughter of Honour .
I have cast mine Eye
Upon thy Form , and I will rear this Beauty
Above all Styles .
You mean no Treason , Sir !
No, I will take away that Jealousie .
I am the Lord of the Philosophers Stone ,
And thou the Lady .
How , Sir ! ha' you that ?
I am the Master of the Mastery .
This day the good old Wretch here o ' the House
Has made it for us : Now he 's at Projection .
Think therefore thy first Wish now ; let me hear it :
And it shall rain into thy Lap , no Shower ,
But Floods of Gold , whole Cataracts , a Deluge ,
To get a Nation on thee .
You are pleas 'd , Sir ,
To work on the Ambition of our Sex .
I 'm pleas 'd , the Glory of her Sex should know ,
This Nook , here , of the Friers is no Climate
For her to live obscurely in , to learn
Physick and Surgery , for the Constables Wife
Of some odd Hundred in Essex : but come forth ,
And taste the Air of Palaces ; eat , drink
The Toils of Emp'ricks , and their boasted Practice ;
Tincture of Pearl and Corral , Gold and Amber ;
Be seen at Feasts and Triumphs ; have it ask 'd ,
What Miracle she is ?
Set all the Eyes
Of Court a-fire , like a Burning-glass ,
And work 'em into Cinders , when the Jewels
Of twenty States adorn thee , and the Light
Strikes out the Stars ; that when thy Name is mention 'd ,
Queens may look pale ; and we but shewing our Love ,
Nero 's Popp?a may be lost in Story !
Thus will we have it .
I could well consent , Sir .
But , in a Monarchy , how will this be ?
The Prince will soon take notice , and both seise
You and your Stone , it being a Wealth unfit
For any private Subject .
If he knew it .
Your self do boast it , Sir . Mam .
To thee , my Life .
O , but beware , Sir ! You may come to end
The remnant of your Days in a loath 'd Prison ,
By speaking of it .
' Tis no idle fear :
We 'll therefore go withal , my Girl , and live
In a Free State , where we will eat our Mullets ,
Sous 'd in High-Country Wines , sup Pheasants Eggs ,
And have our Cockles , boil 'd in Silver Shells ,
Our Shrimps to swim again , as when they liv 'd ,
In a rare Butter , made of Dolphins Milk ,
Whose Cream does look like Opals ; and with these
Delicate Meats set our selves high for Pleasure ,
And take us down again , and then renew
Our Youth and Strength , with drinking the Elixir ,
And so enjoy a Perpetuity
Of Life and Lust .
And thou shalt ha' thy Wardrobe
Richer than Natures , still to change thy self ,
And vary oftner , for thy Pride , than she ,
Or Art , her wise and almost-equal Servant .
Sir , you are too loud .
I hear you every word
Into the Labaratory .
Some fitter place ;
The Garden , or great Chamber above .
How like you her ?
Excellent ! Lungs .
There 's for thee .
But do you hear ?
Good Sir , beware , no mention of the Rabbins .
We think not on 'em .
O , it is well , Sir . Subtle !
Are they gone ?
All 's clear .
The Widow is come .
And your quarrelling Disciple ?
I must to my Captainship again then .
Stay , bring 'em in first .
So I meant .
What is she ?
A Bony-bell ?
I know not .
We 'll draw Lots ,
You 'll stand to that ?
What else ?
O , for a Suit ,
To fall now like a Curtain , flap .
To th ' Door , Man .
You 'll have the first Kiss , 'cause I am not ready .
Yes , and perhaps hit you thro ' both the Nostrils .
Who would you speak with ?
Where 's the Captain ?
Gone , Sir ,
About some Business .
Gone ?
He 'll return straight .
But Master Doctor , his Lieutenant , is here .
Come near , my worshipful Boy , my Terr? Fili ,
That is , my Boy of Land ; make thy Approaches :
Welcome : I know thy Lust , and thy Desires ,
And I will serve and satisfie 'em .
Begin ,
Charge me from thence , or thence , or in this Line ;
Here is my Center : Ground thy Quarrel .
You lie .
How , Child of Wrath and Anger ! the lowd Lie ?
For what , my sudden Boy ?
Nay , that look you to ,
I am afore-hand .
O , this 's no true Grammar ,
And as ill Logick ! You must render Causes , Child ,
Your first and second Intentions , know your Canons ,
And your Divisions , Moods , Degrees , and Differences ,
Your Predicaments , Substance , and Accident ,
Series extern and intern , with their Causes
Efficient , Material , Formal , Final ,
And ha' your Elements perfect ?
What is this !
The angry Tongue he talks in ?
That false Precept ,
Of being afore-hand , has deceiv 'd a number ,
And made 'em enter Quarrels , often-times ,
Before they were aware ; and afterward ,
Against their Wills .
How must I do then , Sir ?
I cry this Lady mercy : She should first
Have been saluted .
I do call you Lady ,
Because you are to be one , ere 't be long ,
My soft and buxom Widow .
Is she , i' faith ?
Yes , or my Art is an egregious Liar .
How know you ?
By inspection on her Forehead ,
And subtilty of her Lip , which must be tasted
her again .
Often , to make a Judgment .
' Slight , she melts
Like a Myrabolane ! Here is yet a Line ,
In Rivo Frontis , tells me , he is no Knight .
What is he then , Sir ?
Let me see your Hand .
O , your Linea Fortun? makes it plain ;
And Stella here , in Monte Veneris :
But , most of all , junctura annularis .
He is a Soldier , or a Man of Art , Lady .
But shall have some great Honour shortly .
Brother ,
He 's a rare Man , believe me ! Kas .
Hold your peace .
Here comes the t 'other rare Man .
' Save you , Captain .
Good Master Kastril .
Is this your Sister ?
I , Sir .
Please you to kuss her , and be proud to know her ?
I shall be proud to know you , Lady .
Brother ,
He calls me Lady too .
I , peace .
I heard it .
The Count is come .
Where is he ?
At the Door .
Why , you must entertain him .
What 'll you do
With these the while ?
Why , have 'em up , and shew 'em
Some fustian Book , or the dark Glass .
' Fore God ,
She is a delicate Dab-chick ! I must have her .
Must you ?
I , if your Fortune will , you must .
Come , Sir , the Captain will come to us presently :
I 'll ha' you to my Chamber of Demonstrations ,
Where I 'll shew you both the Grammar , and Logick ,
And Rhetorick of Quarrelling ; my whole Method
Drawn out in Tables ; and my Instrument ,
That hath the several Scales upon't , shall make you
Able to quarrel , at a Straws-breadth , by Moon-light .
And , Lady , I 'll have you look in a Glass ,
Some half an hour , but to clear your Eye-sight ,
Against you see your Fortune ; which is greater
Than I may judge upon the sudden , trust me .
I 'll come to you presently .
I will ha' this same Widow , now I ha' seen her ,
On any Composition .
What do you say ?
Ha' you dispos 'd of them ?
I ha' sent 'em up .
Subtle , in troth , I needs must have this Widow .
Is that the matter ?
Nay , but hear me .
Go to ,
If you rebel once , Dol shall know it all .
Therefore be quiet , and obey your Chance .
Nay , thou art so violent now ?
Do but conceive :
Thou art old , and canst not serve ? ?
Who , cannot I ?
' Slight , I will serve her with thee , for a ?
Nay ,
But understand : I 'll gi' you Composition .
I will not treat with thee : What , sell my Fortune ?
' Tis better than my Birth-right .
Do not murmur .
Win her , and carry her .
If you grumble , Dol
Knows it directly .
Well , Sir , I am silent .
Will you go help to fetch in Don in state ?
I follow you , Sir : We must keep Face in awe ,
Or he will over-look us like a Tyrant .
Brain of a Taylor ! Who comes here ?
Don John !
Sennores , beso las manos , ? vuestras mercedes .
Would you had stoop 'd a little , and kist our anos .
Peace , Subtle .
Stab me ; I shall never hold , man .
He looks in that deep Ruff , like a Head in a Platter ,
Serv 'd in by a short Cloke upon two Tressils .
Or , what do you say to a Collar of Brawn , cut down
Beneath the Souse , and wriggled with a Knife ?
' Slud , he does look too fat to be a Spaniard .
Perhaps some Fleming , or some Hollander got him
In d ' Alva 's time ; Count Egmont 's Bastard .
Don ,
Your scurvy , yellow , Madrid Face is welcome .
He speaks out of a Fortification .
Pray God he ha' no Squibs in those deep Sets .
Por dios , Sennores , muy linda casa !
What says he ?
Praises the House , I think ;
Yes , the Casa ,
To cozen you in .
Do you mark ?
You shall
Be cozen 'd , Diego .
Cozen 'd , do you see ?
My worthy Donzel , cozen 'd .
Do you intend it ?
So do we , dear Don .
Have you brought Pistolets , or Portagues ,
My solemn Don ?
Dost thou feel any ?
You shall be emptied , Don , pumped , and drawn
Dry , as they say .
Milked , in troth , sweet Don .
See all the Monsters ; the great Lion of all , Don .
Con licencia , se puede ver ? esta Sennora ?
What talks he now ?
O' the Sennora .
O , Don ,
That is the Lioness , which you shall see
Also , my Don .
' Slid , Subtle , how shall we do ?
G g 2 Sub .
For
For what ?
Why Dol 's employ 'd , you know .
That 's true .
' Fore Heaven , I know not : He must stay , that 's all .
Stay ! That he must not , by no means .
No! Why ?
Unless you 'll mar all .
' Slight , he 'll suspect it :
And then he will not pay , not half so well .
This is a travell 'd Punk-master , and do 's know
All the Delays ; a notable hot Rascal ,
And looks already rampant .
'Sdeath , and Mammon
Must not be troubled .
Mammon ! in no case .
What shall we do then ?
Think : you must be sudden .
Entiendo , que la Sennora es tan hermos? , que cod?cio tan
? ver la , como la bien aventur?nza de mi vida .
Mi vida ?
' Slid , Subtle , he puts me in mind o ' the Widow .
What dost thou say to draw her to't ?
ha ?
And tell her it is her Fortune ?
All our Venture
Now lies upon't .
It is but one Man more ,
Which on 's chance to have her : and beside ,
There is no Maidenhead to be fear 'd or lost .
What dost thou think on't , Subtle ?
Who , I ?
Why ? ?
The Credit of our House too is engag 'd .
You made me an Offer for my Share ere-while .
What wilt thou gi' me , i' faith ?
O , by that Light ,
I 'll not buy now .
You know your doom to me .
E'en take your Lot , obey your Chance , Sir ; win her ,
And wear her out , for me .
' Slight , I 'll not work her then .
It is the Common Cause ; therefore bethink you .
Dol else must know it , as you said .
I care not .
Sennores , por que se tarda tanta ?
Faith I am not fit , I am old .
That 's now no Reason , Sir .
Pued ? ser , de hazer burla de mi amor .
You hear the Don too ?
By this Air , I call ,
And loose the Hinges : Dol .
A Plague of Hell ?
Will you then do ?
Yo ' are a terrible Rogue ;
I 'll think of this : Will you , Sir , call the Widow ?
Yes , and I 'll take her too , with all her Faults ,
Now I do think on't better .
With all my heart , Sir ;
Am I discharg 'd o ' the Lot ?
As you please .
Remember now , that upon any Change ,
You never claim her .
Much good Joy , and Health to you , Sir .
Marry a Whore ?
Fate , let me wed a Witch first .
Por estas honrada 's barbas ?
He swears by his Beard .
Dispatch , and call the Brother too .
Tiengo d?da , Sennores ,
Que no me h?gan alguna traycion .
How , issue on ?
Yes , pr?sto Sennor .
Please you
Enthratha the Chambrata , worthy Don ?
Where , if it please the Fates , in your Bathada ,
You shall be soak 'd , and stroak 'd , and tub 'd , and rub 'd ,
And scrub 'd , and fub 'd , dear Don , before you go .
You shall , in faith , my scurvy Baboon Don ,
Be curried , claw 'd , and flaw 'd , and taw 'd , indeed .
I will the heartilier go about it now ,
And make the Widow a Punk so much the sooner ,
To be reveng 'd on this impetuous Face :
The quickly doing of it , is the grace .
Till he had found the very nick of her Fortune .
To be a Countess , say you ?
A Spanish Countess , Sir ?
Why , is that better than an English Countess ?
Better ?
' Slight , make you that a Question , Lady ?
Nay , she is a Fool , Captain , you must pardon her .
Ask from your Courtier , to your Inns-of-Court-man ,
To your meer Millener ; they will tell you all ,
Your Spanish Gennet is the best Horse ; your Spanish
Stoup is the best Garb ; your Spanish Beard
Is the best Cut ; your Spanish Ruffs are the best
Wear ; you Spanish Pavin the best Dance ;
Your Spanish Titillation in a Glove
The best Perfume .
And for your Spanish Pike ,
And Spanish Blade , let your poor Captain speak .
Here comes the Doctor .
My most honour 'd Lady ,
( For so I am now to style you , having found
By this my Scheme , you are to undergo
An honourable Fortune , very shortly . )
What will you say now , if some ? ?
I had told her all , Sir ;
And her right worshipful Brother here , that she shall be
A Countess ; do not delay 'em , Sir : a Spanish Countess .
Still , my scarce worshipful Captain , you can keep
No Secret .
Well , since he has told you , Madam ,
Do you forgive him , and I do .
She shall do that , Sir .
I 'll look to't , 'tis my Charge .
Well then : Nought rests
But that she fit her Love now to her Fortune .
Truly I shall never brook a Spaniard .
No ?
Never sin' Eighty-eight could I abide em ,
And that was some three year afore I was born , in truth .
Come , you must love him , or be miserable ;
Chuse which you will .
By this good Rush , perswade her ,
She will cry Strawberries else , within this Twelve-month .
Nay , Shads and Mackerel , which is worse .
Indeed , Sir ?
Gods lid , you shall love him , or I 'll kick you .
Why ?
I 'll do as you will ha' me , Brother .
Do ,
Or by this Hand I 'll maull you .
Nay , good Sir ,
Be not so fierce .
No, my enraged Child ,
She will be rul 'd .
What , when she comes to taste
The Pleasures of a Countess ! to be courted ?
And kist , and ruffled ! Sub .
I , behind the Hangings .
And then come forth in pomp !
And know her State !
Of keeping all th ' Idolaters o ' the Chamber
Barer to her , than at their Prayers ! Sub .
Is serv 'd
Upon the Knee ! Fac.
And has her Pages , Ushers ,
Foot-men , and Coaches ? ?
Her six Mares ? ?
Nay , eight !
To hurry her through London , to th ' Exchange ,
Bet 'lem , the China-house , ? ?
Yes , and have
The Citizens gape at her , and praise her Tires !
And my Lords Goose-turd Bands , that rides with her !
Most brave ! By this Hand , you are not my Sister ,
If you refuse .
I will not refuse , Brother .
Que es esto , Sennores , que non se venga ?
Esta tardanza me mata ! Fac.
It is the Count come ?
The Doctor knew he would be here , by his Art .
En gallanta Madama , Don ! gallantissima !
Por t?dos los dioses , la mas acabada
Hermosura , que he visto en mi vida !
Is't not a gallant Language that they speak ?
An admirable Language ! Is't not French ?
No, Spanish , Sir . Kas .
It goes like Law-French ,
And that , they say , is the Courtliest Language .
List , Sir .
El Sol ha perdido su lumbre , con el
Resplandor , que tr?e esta dama .
Valga me dios !
He admires your Sister .
Must not she make Curt 'sie ?
'Ods will , she must go to him Man , and kiss him !
It is the Spanish Fashion , for the Women
To make first court .
' Tis true he tells you , Sir :
His Art knows all .
Por que no se ac?de ?
He speaks to her , I think .
That he does , Sir .
Por el amor de dios , que es esto , que se t?da ?
Nay ,
Nay , see : she will not understand him ! Gull .
What say you Brother ?
Ass , Suster ,
Go kuss him , as the cunning Man would ha' you ,
I 'll thrust a Pin i' your Buttocks else .
O , no Sir .
Sennora mia , mi persona muy indigna esta
Alle gar a t?nta Hermosura .
Does he not use her bravely ?
Bravely , i-faith !
Nay , he will use her better .
Do you think so ?
Sennora , si sera servida , entremus .
Where does he carry her ?
Into the Garden , Sir ;
Take you no thought : I must interpret for her .
Give Dol the word .
Come , my fierce Child ,
advance ,
We 'll to our quarrelling Lesson again .
I love a Spanish Boy with all my Heart .
Nay , and by this means , Sir , you shall be Brother
To a great Count .
I , I knew that at first .
This match will advance the House of the Kastrils .
'Pray God your Sister prove but pliant .
Why ,
Her name is so , by her other Husband .
How !
The Widow Pliant .
Knew you not that ?
No faith , Sir :
Yet , by erection of her Figure , I guest it .
Come , let 's go practice .
Yes , but do you think , Doctor ,
I e 'er shall quarrel well ?
I warrant you .
Good Lady ?
That Perdiccas and Antigonus were slain ,
The two that stood , Seleuc' , and Ptolomee ?
Made up the two Legs , and the
fourth Beast .
That was Gog-north , and Egypt-south : which after
Was call 'd Gog Iron-leg , and South Iron-leg ?
Lady ?
And then Gog-horned .
So was Egypt , too .
Then Egypt clay-leg , and Gog clay-leg ?
Sweet Madam .
And last Gog-dust , and Egypt-dust , which fall
In the last Link of the fourth Chain .
And these
Be Stars in story , which none see , or look at ?
What shall I do ?
For , as he says , except
We call the Rabbins , and the Heathen Greeks ? ?
Dear Lady .
To come from Salem , and from
Athens ,
And teach the People of great Britain ?
What 's the matter , Sir ?
To speak the tongue of Eber , and Javan ?
O ,
She 's in her fit .
We shall know nothing ?
Death , Sir ,
We are undone .
Where then a learned Linguist
Sall see the ancient us 'd communion
Of Vowels and Consonants ?
My Master will hear !
A wisdom , which Pythagoras held most high ?
Sweet honourable Lady .
To comprise
All sounds of Voyces , in few marks of Letters ?
Nay , you must never hope to lay her now .
And so we may arrive by Talmud skill ,
And prophane Greek , to raise the building up
Of Helens House against the Ismaelite ,
King of Thogarma , and his Habergions
Brimstony , blue , and fiery ; and the force
Of King Abaddon , and the Beast of Cittim ;
Which Rabbi David Kimchi , Onkelos ,
And Aben-Ezra do interpret Rome .
How did you put her into't ?
Alas , I talk 'd
Of a fifth Monarchy I would erect ,
With the Philosophers ( by chance ) and she
Falls on the other four strait .
Out of Broughton !
I told you so .
' Slid stop her Mouth .
Is't best ?
She 'll never leave else .
If the old Man hear her ,
We are but f?ces , Ashes .
What 's to do there ?
O , we are lost .
Now she hears him , she is quiet .
Where shall I hide me ?
How ! what sight is here !
Close deeds of darkness , and that shun the light !
Bring him again .
Who is he ?
what , my Son !
O , I have liv 'd too long .
Nay good , dear Father ,
There was no unchaste purpose .
Not ?
and flee me ,
When I come in ?
That was my error .
Error ?
Guilt , guilt , my Son .
Give it the right name .
No marvel ,
If I found check in our great work within ,
When such affairs as these were managing !
Why , have you so ?
It has stood still this half hour :
And all the rest of our less works gone back .
Where is the instrument of wickedness ,
My lewd false drudge ?
Nay , good Sir , blame not him .
Believe me , 'twas against his will , or knowledge .
I saw her by chance .
Will you commit more sin ,
T' excuse a Varlet ?
By my hope 'tis true , Sir .
Nay , then I wonder less , if you , for whom
The blessing was prepar 'd , would so tempt Heaven :
And lose your fortunes .
VVhy , Sir ?
This 'll retard
The work , a Month at least .
VVhy , if it do ,
VVhat remedy ?
but think it not , good Father :
Our purposes were honest .
As they were ,
So the reward will prove .
How now ! Aye me .
God , and all Saints be good to us .
VVhat 's that ?
O Sir , we are defeated ! all the works
Are flown in fumo : every Glass is burst .
Fornace , and all rent down ! as if a bolt
Of Thunder had been driven through the House .
Retorts , Receivers , Pellicanes , Bolt-heads ,
All struck in shivers ! Help , good Sir ! Alas ,
Coldness and death invades him .
Nay , Sir Mammon ,
Do the fair offices of a Man ! You stand ,
As you were readier to depart than he .
VVho 's there ?
My Lord her Brother is come .
Ha , Lungs ?
His Coach is at the Door .
Avoid his sight ,
For he 's as furious as his Sister is mad .
Alas !
My Brain is quite undone with the fume , Sir .
I ne 'er must hope to be mine own Man again .
Is all lost , Lungs ?
VVill nothing be preserv 'd ,
Of all our cost ?
Faith , very little , Sir .
A peck of Coals , or so , which is cold comfort , Sir .
O my voluptuous mind ! I am justly punish 'd .
And so am I , Sir .
Cast from all my hopes ? ?
Nay , certainties , Sir .
By mine own base affections .
O , the curst fruits of Vice and Lust !
Good Father ,
It was my sin .
Forgive it .
Hangs my Roof
Over us still , and will not fall , O justice ,
Upon us , for this wicked Man ! Fac.
Nay , look , Sir ,
You grieve him now with staying in his sight :
Good Sir , the noble Man will come too , and take you ,
And that may breed a Trag?dy .
I 'll go .
I , and repent at home , Sir . It may be ,
For some good Penance you may ha't yet ;
A hundred pound to the Box at Bet 'lem ?
For the restoring such as ha' their wits .
I 'll do 't .
I 'll send one to you to receive it .
Is no projection left ?
All flown , or stinks , Sir .
Will nought be sav 'd , that 's good for Med'cine ,
think 'st thou ?
I cannot tell , Sir . There will be , perhaps ,
Something , about the scraping of the Shardes ,
VVill cure the Itch , though not your itch of mind , Sir .
It shall be sav 'd for you , and sent home .
Good Sir ,
This way , for fear the Lord should meet you .
Is he gone ?
Yes , and as heavily
As all the Gold he hop 'd for , were in his Blood .
Let us be light though .
I , as Balls , and bound
And hit our Heads against the Roof for joy :
There 's so much of our care now cast away .
Now to our Don .
Yes , your young widow , by this time
Is made a Countess , Face : Sh' has been in travail
Of a young Heir for you .
Good , Sir . Sub .
Off with your case ,
And greet her kindly , as a Bridegroom should ,
After these common hazards .
Very well , Sir .
VVill you go fetch Don Diego off , the while ?
And fetch him over too , if you 'll be pleas 'd , Sir :
VVould Dol were in her place , to pick his Pockets now .
VVhy , you can do it as well , if you would set to't .
I pray you prove your vertue .
For your sake , Sir .
' Mongst what a nest of Villains ! and how near
Your honour was t 'have catch 'd a certain clap
( Through your credulity ) had I but been
So punctually forward , as place , time ,
And other circumstances would ha' made a Man :
For yo 'are a handsome woman : would yo'were wise too .
I am a Gentleman come here disguis 'd ,
Only to find the knaveries of this Citadel ,
And where I might have wrong 'd your honour , and have not ,
I claim some interest in your love .
You are ,
They say , a widow , rich : and I am a Batchellor ,
VVorth nought : your fortunes may make me a Man ,
As mine ha' preser 'vd you a woman .
Think upon it ,
And whether I have deserv 'd you , or no .
I will , Sir .
And for these houshold-rogues , let me alone ,
To treat with them .
How doth my noble Diego ?
And my dear Madam Countess ?
Hath the Count
Been courteous , Lady ?
liberal ?
and open ?
Donzel , methinks you look melancholick ,
After your coitum , and scurvy ! True-ly ,
I do not like the dulness of your Eye :
It hath a heavy cast , 'tis upsee Dutch ,
And says you are a lumpish whore-master .
Be lighter , I will make your Pockets so .
VVill you , Don Bawd , and pick-purse ?
How now ?
Reel you ?
Stand up Sir , you shall find since I am so heavy ,
I 'll gi' you equal weight .
Help , murder !
No, Sir .
There 's no such thing intended .
A good Cart ,
And a clean Whip shall ease you of that fear .
I am the Spanish Don , that should be cozened ,
Do you see ?
cozened ?
where 's your Captain Face ?
That parcel-broker , and whole-bawd , all Raskal .
How , Surly !
O , make your approach , good Captain .
I ' have found from whence your Copper Rings , and
Spoons
Come , now , wherewith you cheat abroad in Taverns .
' Twas here you learn 'd t 'anoint your Boot with Brim -
stone ,
Then rub Mens Gold on't , for a kind of touch ,
And say 'twas naught , when you had chang 'd the colour ,
That you might ha't for nothing .
And this Doctor ,
Your sooty , smoky-bearded compeer , he
Will close you so much Gold , in a Bolts-head ,
And , on a turn , convey ( i' the stead ) another
With sublim 'd Mercury , that shall burst i' the heat ,
And fly out all in fumo ?
Then weeps Mammon :
Then swoons his worship .
Or , he is the Faustus ,
That casteth Figures , and can Conjure , cures
Plague , Piles , and Pox , by the Ephemerides ,
And holds intelligence with all the Bawds ,
And Midwives of three Shires ?
while you send in ?
Captain , ( what is he gone ? )
Dam 'sels with Child ,
Wives that are barren , or the waiting maid
With the Green sickness ?
Nay Sir , you must tarry
Though he be scap't ; and answer , by the Ears , Sir .
WHy , now 's the time , if ever you will quarrel
Well ( as they say ) and be a true-born Child .
The Doctor , and your Sister both are abus 'd .
VVhere is he ?
which is he ?
he is a slave
VVhat ere he is , and the Son of a VVhore .
Are you
The Man , Sir , I would know ?
I should be loth , Sir ,
To confess so much .
Then you lye i' your Throat .
How ?
A very errant Rogue , Sir , and a cheater ,
Employ 'd here by another Conjurer ,
That does not love the Doctor , and would cross him ,
If he knew how ?
Sir , you are abus 'd .
You lye :
And 'tis no matter .
VVell said , Sir . He is
The impudent 'st Raskal ? ?
You are indeed .
VVill you hear me , Sir ?
By no means : Bid him be gone .
Be gone , Sir , quickly .
This 's strange ! Lady , do you inform your Brother .
There is not such a foist in all the Town ,
The Doctor had him presently : and finds yet ,
The Spanish Count will come here .
Bear up Subtle .
Yes , Sir , he must appear within this hour .
And yet this Rogue would come in a disguise ,
By the temptation of another Spirit ,
To trouble our Art , though he could not hurt it .
I ,
I know ?
Away , you talk like a foolish Mauther .
Sir , all is truth , she says .
Do not believe him , Sir :
He is the lying 'st Swabber ! Come your ways , Sir .
You are valiant out of company .
Yes , how then , Sir ?
Nay , here 's an honest fellow too , that knows him ,
And all his tricks .
( Make good what I say , Abel . )
This cheater would ha' cozen 'd thee o ' the widow .
He owes this honest Drugger , here , seven pound ,
He has had on him , in two-penny 'orths of Tabacco .
Yes Sir . And h ' has damn 'd himself three
Terms to pay me .
And what does he owe for Lotium ?
Thirty Shillings , Sir :
And for six Syringes .
Hydra of villany !
Nay , Sir , you must quarrel him out o ' the House .
I will .
Sir , if you get not out o ' Doors , you lye :
And you are a Pimp .
VVhy , this is madness , Sir ,
Not valor in you : I must laugh at this .
It is my humour : you are a Pimp , and a Trig ,
And an Amadis de Gaule , or a Don Quixot .
Or
Or a Knight o ' the curious Cox-comb .
Do you see ?
Peace to the Houshold .
I 'll keep Peace for no Man .
Casting of Dollers is concluded lawful .
Is he the Constable ?
Peace Ananias .
No, Sir .
Then you are an Otter , and a Shad , a Whit ,
A very Tim .
You 'll hear me , Sir ?
I will not .
What is the motive ?
Zeal in the young Gentleman ,
Against his Spanish slops ?
They are prophane ,
Lewd , superstitious , and idolatrous Breeches .
New Raskals ! Kas .
Will you be gone , Sir ?
Avoid Satan .
Thou art not of the light .
That Ruff of pride ,
About thy Neck , betrays thee : 'and is the same
With that which the unclean Birds , in seventy-seven ,
Were seen to prank it with , on divers Coasts .
Thou look 'st like Antichrist , in that lewd Hat .
I must give way .
Be gone , Sir .
But I 'll take
A course with you ? ?
Depart , proud Spanish Fiend .
Captain , and Doctor ?
Child of perdition .
Hence , Sir .
Did I not quarrel bravely ?
Yes , indeed , Sir .
Nay , an' I give my mind to't , I shall do 't .
O , you must follow , Sir , and threaten him tame .
He 'll turn again else .
I 'll return him then .
Drugger , this Rogue prevented us , for thee :
We had determin 'd that thou should 'st ha' come ,
In a Spanish Sute , and ha' carried her so ; and he
A brokerly slave , goes , puts it on himself .
Hast ' brought the Damask ?
Yes , Sir .
Thou must borrow
A Spanish Sute .
Hast thou no credit with the Players ?
Yes , Sir : did you never see me play the fool ?
I know not , Nab : thou shalt , if I can help it .
Hieronymo 's old Cloak , Ruff , and Hat will serve .
I 'll tell thee more when thou bring 'st 'em .
Sir , I know
The Spaniard hates the Brethren , and hath spies
Upon their actions : and that this was one
I make no scruple .
But the holy Synod
Have been in Prayer , and Meditation for it .
And 'tis reveal 'd no less to them than me ,
That casting of money is most lawful .
True :
But here I cannot do it ; if the House
Shou 'd chance to be suspected , all would out ,
And we be lock 'd up in the Tower for ever ,
To make Gold there ( for th ' State ) never come out :
And then are you defeated .
I will tell
This to the Elders , and the weaker Brethren ,
That the whole company of the Separation
May join in humble Prayer again .
And Fasting . )
Yea , for some fitter place .
The peace of mind
Rest with these Walls .
Thanks , courteous Ananias .
What did he come for ?
About casting Dollers ,
Presently out of hand .
And so I told him ,
A Spanish Minister came here to spie ,
Against the faithful ?
I conceive .
Come Subtle ,
Thou art so down upon the least disaster !
How wouldst tho ' ha' done , if I had not helpt thee out ?
I thank thee Face , for the angry Boy , i-faith .
Who would ha' lookt it should ha' been that
Raskal
Surly ?
He had dy 'd his Beard and all .
Well , Sir ,
Here 's Damask come to make you a Sute .
Where 's Drugger ?
He is gone to borrow me a Spanish habit ;
I 'll be the Count , now .
But where 's the widow ?
Within , with my Lord 's Sister : Madam Dol
Is entertaining her .
By your favour , Face ,
Now she is honest I will stand again .
You will not offer it ?
Why ?
Stand to your word ,
Or ?
here comes Dol .
She knows ?
Yo'are tyrannous still .
Strict for my right .
How now , Dol ?
Hast ' told her ,
The Spanish Count will come ?
Yes , but another is come ,
You little look 'd for ! Fac.
Who 's that ?
Your Master :
The Master of the House .
How , Dol !
She lyes .
This is some trick .
Come , leave your quiblins , Dorothee .
Look out , and see .
Art thou in earnest ?
Forty o ' the Neighbours are about him , talking .
' Tis he , by this good day .
' Twill prove ill day ,
For some on us .
We are undone , and taken .
Lost , I ' am afraid .
You said he would not come ,
While there died one a Week , within the Liberties .
No: 'twas within the Walls .
Was't so ?
Cry ' you mercy :
I thought the Liberties .
What shall we do now , Face ?
Be silent : not a word , if he call or knock .
I 'll into mine old shape again and meet him ,
Of Jeremy , the Butler .
I ' the mean time ,
Do you two pack up all the Goods , and purchase ,
That we can carry i' the two Trunks .
I 'll keep him
Off for to day , if I cannot longer : and then
At night , I 'll ship you both away to Ratcliff ,
Where we 'll meet to morrow , and there we 'll share .
Let Mammon 's Brass and Pewter keep the Cellar :
We 'll have another time for that .
But , Dol ,
'Pr'y thee go heat a little Water quickly ,
Subtle must shave me .
All my Captains Beard
Must off , to make me appear smooth Jeremy .
You 'll do 't ?
Yes , I 'll shave you , as well as I can .
And not cut my Throat , but trim me ?
You shall see , Sir .
Daily , Sir .
And nightly , too .
I , some as brave as Lords .
Ladies , and Gentlewomen .
Citizens Wives .
And Knights .
In Coaches .
Yes , and Oyster-women .
Beside other Gallants .
Sailors wives .
Another Pimlico!
What should my Knave advance ,
To draw this company ?
He hung out no Banners
Of a strange Calf , with five Legs , to be seen ?
Or a huge Lobster , with six Claws ?
No, Sir .
We had gone in then , Sir . Lov.
He has no gift
Of teaching i' the Nose , that ere I knew of .
You saw no Bills set up that promis 'd cure
Of Agues , or the Tooth-ach ?
No such thing , Sir .
Nor heard a Drum strook , for Baboons , or
Puppets ?
Neither , Sir .
What device should he bring forth now ?
I love a teeming Wit as I love my nourishment .
'Pray God he ha' not kept such open House ,
That he hath sold my Hangings , and my Bedding :
I left
I left him nothing else .
If he have eat 'em ,
A Plague o ' the Moath , say I.
Sure he has got
Some bawdy Pictures , to call all this ging ;
The Frier , and the Nun ; or the new Motion
Of the Knights Courser , covering the Parsons Mare ;
The Boy of six year old , with the great Thing :
Or't may be , he has the Fleas that run at Tilt ,
Upon a Table , or some Dog to dance ?
When saw you him ?
Who Sir , Jeremy ?
Jeremy Butler ?
We saw him not this Month .
How !
Not these five weeks , Sir .
These six weeks , at the least .
Yo ' amaze me , Neighbours !
Sure , if your worship know not where he is ,
He 's slipt away .
Pray God , he be not made away .
Ha ?
It 's no time to question , then .
About
Some three weeks since , I heard a doleful cry ,
As I sate up , a mending my Wives Stockings .
This 's strange ! that none will answer !
Didst thou hear
A cry , saist thou ?
Yes , Sir , like unto a Man
That had been strangled an hour , and could not speak .
I heard it too , just this day three weeks , at two
a Clock
Next morning .
These be Miracles , or you make 'em so !
A Man an hour strangled , and could not speak ,
And both you heard him cry ?
Yes , downward , Sir .
Thou art a wise fellow : Give me thy Hand I pray thee .
What Trade art thou on ?
A Smith , an't please your worship .
A Smith ?
Then lend me thy help to get this
Door open .
That I will presently , Sir , but fetch my Tools ?
Sir , best to knock again , afore you break it .
What mean you , Sir ?
1 , 2 , 4 .
O , here 's Jeremy !
Good Sir , come from the Door .
Why ! what 's the matter ?
Yet farther , you are too near yet .
I ' the name of Wonder !
What means the fellow ?
The House , Sir , has been visited .
What ?
with the Plague ?
stand thou then farther .
No, Sir ,
I had it not .
Who had it then ?
I left
None else , but thee , i'the House !
Yes , Sir , my fellow ,
The Cat , that kept the Buttry , had it on her
A week before I spied it : but I got her
Convey 'd away , i' the night .
And so I shut
The House up for a month ? ?
How ! Fac.
Purposing then , Sir ,
T' have burnt Rose-vinegar , Treacle , and Tar ,
And ha' made it sweet , that you should ne 'er ha' known it :
Because I knew the news would but afflict you , Sir .
Breathe less , and farther off .
Why , this is stranger !
The Neighbours tell me all , here , that the Doors
Have still been open ? ?
How , Sir !
Gallants , Men , and Women ,
And of all sorts , tag-rag , been seen to flock here
In threaves , these ten weeks , as to a second Hogs-den ,
In days of Pimlico , and Eye-bright ! Fac.
Sir ,
Their wisdoms will not say so ! Lov.
To day , they speak
Of Coaches , and Gallants ; one in a French-hood ,
VVent in , they tell me : and another was seen
In a Velvet Gown at the window ! divers more
Pass in and out !
They did pass through the Doors then ,
Or Walls , I assure their Eye-sights , and their Spectacles ;
For here , Sir , are the Keys : and here have been ,
In this my Pocket , now above twenty days !
And for before , I kept the Fort alone there .
But that 'tis yet not deep i' the afternoon ,
I should believe my Neighbours had seen double
Through the black-pot , and made these apparitions !
For , on my faith to your worship , for these three weeks ,
And upwards , the Door has not been open 'd .
Strange !
Good faith , I think I saw a Coach !
And I too ,
I'lld ha' been sworn ! Lov.
Do you but think it now ?
And but one Coach ?
We cannot tell , Sir : Jeremy
Is a very honest fellow .
Did you see me at all ?
No ; that we are sure on .
I 'll be sworn o'that .
Fine Rogues to have your Testimonies built on !
Is Jeremy come ?
O , yes , you mave leave your Tools ,
We were deceiv 'd , he says .
He has had the Keys :
And the Door has been shut these three weeks .
Like enough .
Peace , and get hence , you Changelings .
Surly come !
And Mammon made acquainted ?
They 'll tell all .
( How shall I beat them off ?
What shall I do ? )
Nothing 's more wretched than a guilty Conscience .
NO , Sir , he was a great Physician .
This
It was no Bawdy-house : but a meer Chancel .
You knew the Lord , and his Sister .
Nay , good Surly ? ?
The happy word , Be rich ?
Play not the Tyran ? ?
Should be to day pronounc 'd to all your Friends .
And where be your Andirons now ?
and your Brass-pots ,
That should ha' been golden Flaggons , and great Wedges ?
Let me but breathe .
What ! they ha' shut
their Doors ,
Methinks ! Sur .
I , now 'tis holy-day with them .
Rogues ,
Cozeners , Impostors , Bawds .
What mean you , Sir ?
To enter , if we can .
Another Mans House ?
Here is the owner , Sir . Turn you to him ,
And speak your business .
Are you , Sir , the owner ?
Yes , Sir .
And are those Knaves within your Cheaters ?
What Knaves ?
what Cheaters ?
Subtle , and his Lungs .
The Gentleman is distracted , Sir ! No Lungs ,
Nor Lights ha' been seen here these three weeks , Sir ,
Within these Doors , upon my word ! Sur .
Your word ,
Groom arrogant ?
Yes , Sir , I am the House-keeper ,
And know the Keys ha' not been out o ' my Hands .
This 's a new Face .
You do mistake the House , Sir !
What Sign was't at ?
You Raskal ! This is one
O' the confederacy .
Come , let 's get Officers ,
And force the Door .
'Pray you stay , Gentlemen .
No, Sir , we 'll come with Warrant .
I , and then
We shall ha' your Doors open .
What means this ?
I cannot tell , Sir .
These are two o ' the Gallants ,
That we do think we saw .
Two o ' the Fools ?
You talk as idly as they .
Good faith , Sir ,
I think
I think the Moon has cras 'd 'em all ! ( O me ,
The angry Boy come too ?
He 'll make a noise ,
And ne 'er away till he have betray 'd us all . )
What Rogues , Bawds , Slaves , you 'll open the
Door anon ,
Punck , Cocatrice , my Suster .
By this light
I 'll fetch the Marshal to you .
You are a Whore ,
To keep your Castle ?
Who would you speak with , Sir ?
The bawdy Doctor , and the cozening Captain ,
And Pus my Suster .
This is something , sure !
Upon my trust , the Doors were never open , Sir .
I have heard all their tricks told me twice over ,
By the fat Knight , and the lean Gentleman .
Here comes another .
Ananias too ?
And his Pastor ?
The Doors are shut against us .
Come forth , you Seed of Sulphur , Sons of Fire ,
Your stench it is broke forth : abomination
Is in the House .
I , my Suster 's there .
The place ,
It is become a Cage of unclean Birds .
Yes , I will fetch the Scavenger , and the Constable .
You shall do well .
We 'll joyn to weed them out .
You will not come then ?
Punck , device , my
Suster !
Call her not Sister .
She 's a Harlot , verily .
I 'll raise the street .
Good Gentlemen , a word .
Satan avoid , and hinder not our Zeal .
The world 's turn 'd Bet 'lem .
These are all broke loose ,
Out of S.
Kather 'nes , where they use to keep
The better sort of mad-folks .
All these Persons
We saw go in and out here .
Yes , indeed , Sir .
These were the Parties .
Peace , you Drunkards .
Sir ,
I wonder at it ! Please you to give me leave
To touch the Door , I 'll try an' the Lock be chang 'd .
It mazes me ! Fac.
Good faith , Sir , I believe
There 's no such thing .
' Tis all deceptio visus .
Would I could get him away .
Master Captain , Master Doctor .
Who 's that ?
( Our Clerk within , that I forgot ! ) I know not , Sir .
For God 's sake , when will her Grace be at leisure ?
Ha !
Illusions , some Spirit o ' the Air : ( his Gag is melted ,
And now he sets out the Throat . )
I am almost stifled ? ?
( Would you were altogether . )
' Tis i' the House .
Ha ! List .
Believe it , Sir , i' the Air !
Peace , you ? ?
Mine Aunts Grace does not use me well .
You Fool ,
Peace , you 'll mar all .
Or you will else , you Rogue .
O , is it so ?
Then you converse with Spirits !
Come Sir . No more o ' your tricks , good Jeremy ,
The truth , the shortest way .
Dismiss this Rabble , Sir .
What shall I do ?
I am catch 'd .
Good Neighbours ,
I thank you all .
You may depart .
Come Sir ,
You know that I am an indulgent Master :
And therefore conceal nothing .
What 's your Med'cine ,
To draw so many several sorts of wild fowl ?
Sir , you were wont to affect mirth and wit :
( But here 's no place to talk on't i' the Street . )
Give me but leave to make the best of my Fortune ,
And only pardon me th ' abuse of your House :
It 's all I beg .
I 'll help you to a widow ,
In recompence , that you shall gi' me thanks for ,
VVill make you seven years younger , and a rich one .
' Tis but your putting on a Spanish Cloak .
I have her within .
You need not fear the House ,
It was not visited .
But by me , who came
Sooner than you expected .
It is true , Sir .
'Pray you forgive me .
Well , let 's see your widow .
Yes faith , it crumbled
Away i' my Mouth .
You ha' spoil 'd all then .
No,
I hope my Aunt of Fairy will forgive me .
Your Aunt 's a gracious Lady : but in troth
You were to blame .
The fume did over come me ,
And I did do 't to stay my Stomach .
'Pray you
So satisfie her Grace .
Here comes the Captain .
How now ! Is his Mouth down ?
I ! he has spoken !
( A Pox , I heard him , and you too . )
He 's un-
done then .
( I have been fain to say , the House is haunted
With Spirits , to keep Churle back .
And hast thou done it ?
Sure , for this night .
Why , then triumph and sing
Of Face so famous , the precious King
Of present wits .
Did you not hear the coil ,
About the Door ?
Yes , and I dwindled with it . )
Shew him his Aunt , and let him be dispatch 'd :
I 'll send her to you .
Well Sir , your Aunt her Grace ,
Will give you Audience presently , on my sute ,
And the Captains word , that you did not eat your Gag
In any contempt of her Highness .
Not I , in troth , Sir .
Here she is come .
Down o ' your Knees and
wriggle :
She has a stately presence .
Yet nearer ,
And bid , God save you .
And your Aunt .
And my most gracious Aunt , God save you Grace .
Nephew , we thought to have been angry with
you :
But that sweet Face of yours hath turn 'd the Tide ,
And made it flow with Joy , that ebb 'd of Love .
Arise , and touch our Velvet Gown .
The Skirts ,
And kiss 'em .
Let me now stroke that Head .
Much , Nephew , shalt thou win ; much shalt thou spend ;
Much shalt thou give away : much shalt thou lend .
( I , much , indeed . )
Why do you not thank her
I cannot speak for joy .
See , the kind wretch !
Your Graces Kinsman right .
Give me the Bird .
Here is your Fly in a Purse , about your Neck , Cousin ,
Wear it , and feed it about this day sev'night ,
On your right Wrist ?
Open a Vein with a Pin ,
And let it suck but once a week : till then ,
You must not look on't .
And , Kinsman ,
Bear your self worthy of the Blood you come on .
Her grace would ha' you eat no more Woolsack Pies ,
Nor Dagger Frume 'ty .
Nor break his fast ,
In Heaven and Hell .
She 's with you every where !
Nor play with Costar-mongers , at mum-chance , tray-trip .
God make you rich , ( when as your Aunt has done it : )
but keep
The gallant 'st Company , and the best Games ?
Yes , Sir .
Gleek and Primero : and what you get , be true to us .
H h Dap .
By
By this Hand , I will .
You may bring 's a thousand Pound
Before to morrow night , ( if but three thousand
Be stirring ) an' you will .
I swear , I will then .
Your Fly will learn you all Games .
Ha' you done there ?
Your Grace will command him no more duties ?
No:
But come , and see me often .
I may chance
To leave him three or four hundred Chests of Treasure ,
And some twelve thousand Acres of Fairy Land ,
If he game well , and comely , with good Gamesters .
There 's a kind Aunt ! kiss her departing part .
But you must sell your forty Mark a year , now .
I , Sir , I mean .
Or , gi't away : Pox on't .
I 'll gi't mine Aunt .
I 'll go and fetch the Writings .
' Tis well , away .
Where 's Subtle ?
What news ?
Drugger is at the Door , go take his Sute ,
And bid him fetch a Parson , presently :
Say , he shall marry the widow .
Thou shalt spend
A hundred pound by the service ! Now Queen Dol ,
Ha' you pack 'd up all ?
And how do you like
The Lady Pliant ?
A good dull innocent .
Here 's your Hieronymo 's Cloke , and Hat .
Give me 'em .
And the Ruff too ?
Yes , I 'll come to you presently .
Now he is gone about his project Dol ,
I told you of , for the widow .
' Tis direct
Against our Articles .
Well , we 'll fit him , wench .
Hast thou gull 'd her of her Jewels , or her Bracelets ?
No, but I will do 't .
Soon at night , my Dolly .
When we are shipt , and all our Goods aboard ,
East-ward for Ratcliff ; we will turn our course
To Brainford , westward , if thou saist the word ,
And take our leaves of this ore-weening Raskal ,
This peremptory Face .
Content , I ' am weary of him .
Thou'hast cause , when the slave will run a wi -
ving , Dol ,
Against the Instrument that was drawn between us .
I 'll pluck his Bird as bare as I can .
tell her ,
She must by any means address some present
To th ' cunning Man ; make him amends for wronging
His Art with her suspicion ; send a Ring ,
Or Chain of Pearl ; she will be tortur 'd else
Extremely in her sleep , say : and ha' strange things
Come to her .
Wilt thou ?
My fine flitter-mouse ,
My Bird o ' the night ; we 'll tickle it at the Pigeons ,
When we have all , and may unlock the Trunks ,
And say , this 's mine , and thine ; and thine and mine .
What now , a billing ?
Yes , a little exalted
In the good passage of our stock-affairs .
Drugger has brought his Parson ; take him in , Subtle ,
And send Nab back again to wash his Face .
I will : and shave himself ?
If you can get him .
You are hot upon it , Face , what ere it is !
A trick , that Dol shall spend ten pound a
Month by .
Is he gone ?
The Chaplain waits you i' the Hall , Sir .
I 'll go bestow him .
He 'll now marry her ,
He cannot , yet , he is not ready .
Dear Dol ,
Cozen her of all thou canst .
To deceive him
Is no deceit , but Justice , that would break
Such an inextricable tye as ours was .
Let me alone to fit him .
Come , my ventures ,
You ha' packt up all ?
Where be the Trunks ?
Bring
Let 's see 'em .
Where 's the mony ?
Here ,
In this .
Mammon 's ten pound : eight score before .
The Brethrens money , this .
Druggers , and Dappers .
What Papers that ?
The Jewel of the waiting Maids ,
That stole it from her Lady , to know certain ? ?
If she should have precedence of her Mistris ?
What Box is that ?
The Fish-wives Rings , I think :
And th ' Ale-wives single money .
Is't not Dol ?
Yes : and the whistle , that the Sailors Wife
Brought you to know an' her Husband were with Ward .
We 'll wet it to morrow : and our Silver-beakers ,
And Tavern Cups .
Where be the French Peti-coats ,
And Girdles , and Hangers ?
Here , i' the Trunk ,
And the Bolts of Lawn .
Is Druggers Damask there ?
And the Tabacco ?
Give me the Keys .
Why you the Keys !
No matter , Dol : because
We shall not open 'em , before he comes .
' Tis true , you shall not open them , indeed :
Nor have 'em forth .
Do you see ?
Not forth , Dol .
No!
No, my smock-rampant .
The right is , my Master
Knows all , has pardo n 'd me , and he will keep 'em ;
Doctor , 'tis true (you look ) for all your Figures :
I sent for him , indeed .
Wherefore , good Partners ,
Both he , and she , be satisfied : for here
Determines the Indenture tripartite ,
' Twixt Subtle , Dol , and Face .
All I can do
Is to help you over the Wall , o ' the back-side ;
Or lend you a Sheet to save your Velvet Gown , Dol .
Here will be Officers presently ; bethink you ,
Of some course suddainly to scape the Dock :
For thither you 'll come else .
Hark you , Thunder .
You are a precious Fiend !
Open the Door .
Dol , I am sorry for thee i-faith .
But hearst thou ?
It shall go hard , but I will place thee some-where :
Thou shalt ha' my Letter to Mistris Amo .
Hang you ? ?
Or Madam C?sarean .
Pox upon you , Rogue ,
Would I had but time to beat thee .
Subtle ,
Let 's know where you set up next ; I 'll send you
A customer , now and then , for old acquaintance :
What new course ha' you ?
Rogue , I 'll hang my self :
That I may walk a greater Devil than thou ,
And haunt thee i' the Flock-bed , and the Buttery .
WHat do you mean , my Masters ?
Open your Door ,
Cheaters , Bawds , Conjurers .
Or we 'll break it open .
What Warrant have you ?
Warrant enough , Sir , doubt not :
If you 'll not open it .
Is there an Officer , there ?
Yes , two or three for failing .
Have but patience ,
And I will open it straight .
Sir , ha' you done ?
Is it a marriage ?
perfect ?
Yes , my Brain .
Off with your Ruff , and Cloke then ; be your self , Sir .
Down with the Door .
' Slight ,
' Slight , ding it open .
Hold :
Hold Gentlemen , what means this violence ?
VVhere is this Colliar ?
And my Captain Face ?
These day-Owls .
That are birding in Mens Purses .
Madam Suppository .
Doxey , my Sister .
Locusts
Of the foul Pit .
Profane as Bel and the Dragon .
Worse than the Grashoppers , or the Lice of Egypt .
Good Gentlemen , hear me .
Are you Officers ,
And cannot stay this violence ?
Keep the Peace .
Gentlemen , what is the matter ?
Whom do you seek ?
The Chimical cozener .
And the Captain Pander .
The Nun my Suster .
Madam Rabbi .
Scorpions ,
And Caterpillers .
Fewer at once , I pray you .
One after another , Gentlemen , I charge you ,
By vertue of my staff ?
They are the vessels
Of Pride , Lust , and the Cart .
Good Zeal , lie still ,
A little while .
Peace , Deacon Ananias .
The House is mine here , and the Doors are open :
If there be any such Persons as you seek for ,
Use your authority , search on o ' Gods Name .
I am but newly come to Town , and finding
This tumult 'bout my Door ( to tell you true )
It somewhat maz 'd me ; till my Man , here , ( fearing
My more displeasure ) told me he had done
Somewhat an insolent part , let out my House
( Belike , presuming on my known aversion
From any Air o ' the Town , while there was Sickness )
To a Doctor , and a Captain : who , what they are ,
Or where they be , he knows not .
Are they gone ?
You may go in and search , Sir . Here , I find
The empty Walls worse than I left 'em , smok 'd ,
A few crack 'd Pots , and Glasses , and a Fornace ;
The Ceiling fill 'd with Poesies of the Candle :
And Madam , with a Dildo , writ o ' the Walls .
Onely one Gentlewoman , I met here ,
That is within , that said she was a widow ? ?
I , that 's my Suster .
I 'll go thump her .
Where
is she ?
And should ha' married a Spanish Count , but he ,
VVhen he came to't , neglected her so grosly ,
That I , a widower , am gone through with her .
How ! Have I lost her then ?
Were you the Don , Sir ?
Good faith , now , she do 's blame yo ' extremely , and says
You swore , and told her , you had tane the pains
To dye your Beard , and umbre o 'er your Face ,
Borrowed a Sute , and Ruff , all for her love ;
And then did nothing .
VVhat an over-sight ,
And want of putting forward , Sir , was this !
VVell fare an old Harquebuzier , yet ,
Could prime his Powder , and give fire , and hit ,
All in a twinckling .
The whole nest are fled !
VVhat sort of Birds were they ?
A kind of Choughs ,
Or thievish Daws , Sir , that have pickt my Purse
Of eight-score and ten pounds , within these five weeks ,
Beside my first Materials ; and my Goods ,
That lie i' the Cellar : which I am glad they ha' left .
I may have home yet .
Think you so Sir ?
By order of Law , Sir , but not otherwise .
Not mine own stuff ?
Sir , I can take no knowledg ,
That they are yours , but by publick means .
If you can bring Certificate , that you were gull 'd of em ,
Or any formal VVrit out of a Court ,
That you did cozen your self , I will not hold them .
I 'll rather lose 'em .
That you shall not , Sir ,
By me , in troth .
Upon these terms they are yours .
What should they ha' been , Sir , turn 'd into Gold all ?
I cannot tell .
It may be they should .
What then ?
What a great loss in hope have you sustain 'd ?
Not I , the Commonwealth has .
I , he would ha' built
The City new ; and made a Ditch about it
Of Silver , should have run with Cream from Hogsden ;
That every Sunday in Moor-fields , the youngkers ,
And tits , and tom-boys should have fed on , gratis .
I will go mount a Turnip-cart , and preach
The end o ' the world , within these two months .
Surly ,
What ! in a dream ?
Must I needs cheat my self ,
With that same foolish vice of honesty !
Come let us go , and hearken out the Rogues .
That Face I 'll mark for mine , if e 'er I meet him .
If I can hear of him , Sir , I 'll bring you word ,
Unto your Lodging : for in troth , they were strangers
To me , I thought 'em honest , as my self , Sir .
' Tis well , the Saints shall not lose all yet .
Go ,
And get some Carts ?
For what , my zealous Friends ?
To bear away the portion of the righteous
Out of this Den of Thieves .
What is that portion ?
The Goods , sometimes the Orphans , that the
Brethren
Bought with their Silver Pence .
What , those i' the Cellar ,
The Knight Sir Mammon claims ?
I do defie
The wicked Mammon , so do all the Brethren .
Thou prophane Man , I ask thee , with what conscience
Thou canst advance that Idol against us ,
That have the Seal ?
Were not the Shillings numbred ,
That made the Pounds ?
Were not the Pounds told out ,
Upon the second day of the fourth week ,
In the eighth month , upon the Table dormant ,
The year of the last patience of the Saints ,
Six hundred and ten ?
Mine earnest vehement Botcher ,
And Deacon also , I cannot dispute with you ,
But if you get you not away the sooner ,
I shall confute you with a Cudgel .
Be patient Ananias .
I am strong ,
And will stand up , well girt , against an Host ,
That threaten Gad in exile .
I shall send you
To Amsterdam to your Cellar .
I will pray there ,
Against thy House : may Dogs defile thy Walls ,
And Wasps , and Hornets breed beneath thy Roof ,
This seat of falshood , and this cave of coz'nage .
Another too ?
Not I Sir , I am no Brother .
Away you Harry Nicholas , do you talk ?
No, this was Abel Drugger .
Good Sir , Go ,
And satisfie him ; tell him , all is done :
He staid too long a washing of his Face .
The Doctor , he shall hear of him at Westchester ;
And of the Captain , tell him , at Yarmouth , or
Some good Port-town else , lying for a wind .
If you get off the angry Child , now Sir ? ? ?
Come on , you yew , you have match 'd most
sweetly , ha' you not ?
Did not I say , I would never ha' you tupt
But by a dubb 'd Boy , to make you a Lady-Tom ?
' Slight , you are a Mammet ! O , I could touse you , now .
Death , mun'you marry with a Pox ?
You lye , Boy ;
As sound as you : and I am afore-hand with you .
Anon ?
Come , will you quarrel ?
I will seize you , Sirrah .
Why do you not buckle to your Tools ?
Gods light !
This is a fine old Boy , as ere I saw !
H h 2 Lov.
What
What , do you change your Copy , now ?
Proceed ,
Here stands my Dove : stoop at her if you dare .
' Slight , I must love him ! I cannot chuse , i-faith !
And I should be hang 'd for't .
Suster , I protest ,
I honour thee for this match .
O , do you so , Sir ?
Yes , an' thou canst take Tabacco , and drink , old Boy ,
I 'll give her five hundred Pound more to her marriage ,
Than her own State .
Fill a Pipe-full , Jeremy .
Yes , but go in , and take it , Sir . Lov.
We will .
I will be rul 'd by thee in any thing , Jeremy .
' Slight , thou art not hide-bound ! thou art a Jovy '
Boy !
Come let 's in , I pr'y thee , and take our whiffs .
Whiff in with your Sister , brother Boy .
That
Master
That had receiv 'd such happiness by a Servant ,
In such a Widow , and with so much Wealth ,
Were very ungrateful , if he would not be
A little indulgent to that Servants wit ,
And help his Fortune , though with some small strain
Of his own Candor .
Therefore , Gentlemen ,
And kind Spectators , if I have out-stript
An old Mans gravity , or strict Canon , think
What a young Wife , and a good Brain may do :
Stretch ages truth sometimes , and crack it too .
Speak for thy self , Knave .
So I will , Sir . Gentlemen ,
Hot Ananias , Dapper , Drugger , all
With whom I traded ; yet I put my self
On you , that are my Country : and this Pelf ,
Which I have got , if you do quit me , rests
To feast you often , and invite new Guests .
