Tricks and shows : protestations with men are like tears with women ,
forgot ere the cheek be dry . Gerardine is a gentleman ; his lands
be in statutes : 'a is not for thee , nor thou for him ; 'a is a
gallant , and young thoughts be most unconstant .
Yet young vines yield most wine .
But old vines the best . Believe not these great-breeched gallants ;
they love for profit , not for affection ; if 'a brings thee to
a fool 's paradise , 'a will forsake thee .
Which fortune God send my enemy . Love is a cold heat , a bitter
sweet , a pleasure full of pain , a huge loss , and no gain . Why
shouldst thou love him only ?
Words cannot force what destiny hath seal 'd .
Who can resist the influence of his stars ,
Or give a reason why 'a loves or hates ,
Since our affections are not rul 'd by will ,
But will by our affections ? ' Tis blasphemy
' Gainst love 's most sacred deity , to axe
Why we do love , since 'tis his only power
That sways all our affections ; all things which be ,
Beasts , birds , men , gods , pay him their fealty .
Tut , love is an idle fantasy , bred by desire , nursed by delight ,
an humour that begins his dominion in Leo the Lion , the sign of
the heart , and ends in Aries the Ram , the sign of the head ; his
power is to stir the blood , pricks up the flesh , fills all the
body with a libidinous humour , and is indeed the overture of all
ladies . Which to prevent , I have banished Gerardine , your dearly
beloved , my house ; and as for you , since I am your guardian by
my brother 's last will , I will sequester you from all other rooms
in my house , save this gallery and your upper chamber , till in
discretion I shall find it convenient to enlarge you .
My body you may circumscribe , confine
And keep in bounds ; but my unlimited love
Extends itself beyond all circumscription .
Believe me , Maria , I have known the natures of divers of these
gallants : if they possess the unlimited love of us women in never
so ample manner , without the society of the body , I know how soon
their love vadeth . Young men 's love is like ivy : it must have
somewhat to cleave to , or it never prospers . Love is like fasting-days , but the body is like flesh-days ; and 'tis our English
gallants ' fashion to prefer a morsel of flesh before all the fasting-days in the whole year .
The news with you , Vial ?
And it like your worship , here 's Club , Master Purge the pothecary 's
prentice , come to invite you , my mistress and Mistress Maria to
supper , and to see Master Gerardine 's will sealed .
Tell Club my wife and myself will be there , but Maria shall not
come .
There must be your sweetheart 's parting feast : now 'a perceives
no access to my house , 'a will to sea . A good riddance : if 'a
returns not , you forsooth are his heir , that 's not much amiss .
Yet there may be tricks ; I will not be overreached . Come to
your chamber , where till my return you shall be in safe custody .
0 silly men , which seek to keep in awe
Women 's affections , which can know no law !
Now , by the horns of Cupid 's bow , which hath been the bane to
many a tall citizen , I think there be no finer fools under heaven than we men when we are lovers . How thou goest crying up and down with thy arms across for a wife ; which hadst thou , she 'd
cross both arms , head and heart . Dost not yet know the old saying ,
a wife brings but two good days , that is her wedding-day , and
death-day ?
Believe him , Gerardine , 'a speaks now gospel ; a man may take more
wife with one hand than he 's able to put away with ten , Gerardine .
A wife is such a cross , that all married men would most gladly
be rid of .
And yet such a cross that all bachelors would gladly be creeping
to .
Profane not thus the sacred name of love ,
You libertines , who never knew the joys
Nor precious thoughts of two consenting hearts .
Didst ever see the true picture of a lover ? I can give thee the
hieroglyphic ; and this it is : a man standing naked , a wench tickling
him on the left side with a feather and pricking him under the
right side with a needle . The allegory , as I take , is this : that
at the first we are so overjoyed with obtaining a wife , that we
conceit no heaven like to the first night 's lodging ; and that 's
the signification of the left side , for wives always in the night
take the left-side place . But sir , now come to the needle on
the right side : that 's the day-time , wherein she commands ; then ,
sir , she has a certain thing called tongue , ten times more sharp
than a needle , and that at the least displeasure a man must have
shot quite through him .
Gramercies , Lipsalve , my neat courtier ! But sirrah Gerardine ,
be thyself sociable and free , leave not thy native soil for a
giglot , a wench who in her wit is proud--
In her smile deceitful--
In her hate revengeable--
And in nothing but her death acceptable . I 'll tell thee , there 's
no creature more desirous of an honest name and worse keeps it ,
than a woman . Dost hear ? Follow this song , and if ever thou
forsake thy country for a wagtail , let me be whipped to death
with ladies ' hair-laces .
Let 's hear that worthy song , gentle Master Lipsalve .
Observe :
Now if I list , will I love no more ,
Nor longer wait upon a gill ;
Since every place now yields a wench ,
If one will not , another will ;
And if what I have heard be true ,
Then young and old and all will do .
How dost thou like this , man ?
No more , no more .
This is the chamber which confines my love ,
This is the abstract of the spacious world .
Within it holds a gem so rich , so rare ,
That art or nature never yet could set
A valued price to her invalued worth .
Unvalued worth ? ha , ha , ha ! Why , she 's but
A woman , and they are windy turning vanes :
Love light as chaff , which when our nourishing grains
Are winnow 'd from them , unconstantly they fly
At the least wind of passion . A woman 's eye
Can turn itself with quick dexterity
And in each wanton glass can comprehend
Their sundry fancy suited to each friend .
Tut , their loves are all compact of levity
Even like themselves :
Tut , man , everyone knows their worth when they are at a rack-rent . In the term-time they bear as great a price as wheat
when transportations are--
Peace ; let 's draw near the window and listen if we may hear her .
Debarr 'd of liberty ! 0, that this flesh
Could like swift-moving thoughts transfer itself
From place to place , unseen and undissolv 'd :
Then should no iron ribs or churlish flint
Divide my love and me . Dear Gerardine ,
Despite of chance or guardian 's tyranny ,
I 'd move within thy orb and thou in mine .
She 'd move within thy orb , and thou in hers ?
Blood , she talks bawdy to herself . Gudgeon , stand close .
But in vain do I proclaim my grief ,
When air and walls can yield me no relief .
The walls are the more stony-hearted
then .
Peace , good Gudgeon , gape not so loud .
Come thou my best companion , thou art sensible
And canst my wrongs reiterate ; thou and I
Will make some mirth in spite of tyranny .
The black-brow 'd night , drawn in her pitchy wain ,
In starry-spangled pride rides now o 'er heaven ;
Now is the time when stealing minutes tell
The stole delight joy 'd by all faithful lovers ;
Now loving souls contrive both place and means
For wished pastimes ; only I am pent
Within the closure of this fatal wall ,
Depriv 'd of all my joys .
My dear Maria , be comforted in this :
The frame of heaven shall sooner cease to move ,
Bright Phoebus ' steeds leave their diurnal race
And all that is forsake their natural being ,
Ere I forget thy love .
Who 's that protests so fast ?
Thy ever-vowed servant , Gerardine .
0, by your vows it seems you 'd fain get up .
Ay , and ride too .
I would , most lov 'd Maria .
GUDGEON
I knew it : he that to get up to a fair woman
will stick to vow and swear , may be accounted no man .
But tell me
Why hast thou chose this hour to visit me ,
Which nor the day nor night can claim , but both
Or neither ? Why in this twilight cam 'st thou ?
T' avoid suspicious eyes ; I come , dear love ,
To take my last farewell : fitting this hour ,
Which nor bright day will claim nor pitchy night ,
An hour fit to part conjoined souls .
Since that my native soil will not afford
My wish 'd and best content , I will forsake it
And prove more strange to it than it to me .
In time 's swift course all things shall find event
Be it good or ill ; and destinies do grant
That most preposterous courses often gain
What labour and direct proceedings miss .
Wo't thou forsake me then ?
Let first blest life forsake me ! Be constant ;
My absence may procure thy more enlarge
And then--
Desire 's conceit is quick , I apprehend thee .
Be thou as loyal as I constant prove ,
And time shall knit our mutual knot of love :
Wear this , my love 's true pledge . I need not wish ,
I know thou wo 't return , nor will I say
Thou may 'st conceal thyself , being return 'd ,
Till I may make escape , and visit thee .
I prithee , love , attempt not to ascend
My chamber-window by a ladder 'd rope .
Th' entrance is too narrow , except this post
Which may with ease , yet that is dangerous :
I prithee do it not . I hear some call . Farewell :
My constant love let after-actions tell .
0 perfection of women !
LIPSALVE
A plague of such perfection !
How she woos !
By negatives shows--
Thee what to do , under colour of dissuasion .
She 's truly virtuous !
Tut , man , outward apparance is no authentic instance of the inward
desires . Women have sharp falcon 's eyes , and can soar aloft ;
but keep them like falcons from flesh , and they soon stoop to
a gaudy lure .
Why , then Huguenot women are admirable angels .
But angels make them admirable devils .
My love 's chaste smile to all the world doth speak
Her spotless innocence .
Women 's smiles are more of custom than of courtesy . Women are
creatures : their hearts and they are full of holes , apt to receive ,
but not retain affection . Thou wilt tomorrow thou sayest be gone :
if thou wilt know the worst of a country 's , marry before thou
goest ; for if thou canst endure a curst wife , never care what
company thou comest in .
Come , merry gallants , will you associate me to my cousin Purge 's
the pothecary 's and take part of my parting feasts tonight ?
0, his wife is of the Family of Love , I 'll thither : perhaps I
may prove of the fraternity in time ; we 'll thither , that 's flat .
What , Club , Club ! Is Club within there ?
Mistress ?
I pray , what said Master Doctor Glister , will 'a come ?
' A sent word 'a would , for 'a was but to carry a diet to one of his patients : what call you her ? She that paints a day-times , and looks fair and fresh on the outside , but in the night-time is filthier than the inside of Bocardo , and is indeed far more unsavoury to those that know her , forsooth .
Went 'a to her ?
' A had a receipt for the grincomes in his hand , and 'a said 'a
would take that in his way .
' Tis well ; and what guest besides him and his wife will be here
at supper ?
The first in my account is Master Gerardine your cousin , Master Doctor Glister and his wife , Master Dryfat the merchant , Master Lipsalve the courtier , Master Gudgeon the gallant , and their pages . These I take will be your full number .
Then belike my room shall be stuffed with courtiers and gallants tonight . Of all men I love not these gallants : they 'll prate much but do little ; they are people most uncertain : they use great words , but little sense ; great beards , but little wit ; great breeches , but no money .
That was the last thing they swore away .
Belike they cannot fetch it again with swearing , for if they could , there 's not a page of theirs but would be as rich as a monarch .
There 's nothing , mistress , that is sworn out of date that returns .
Their first oath in times past was " by the mass" , and
that they have sworn quite away ; then came they to their faith ,
" as by my faith , 'tis so" : that in a short time was
sworn away too , for no man believes now more than 'a sees ; then
they swore " by their honesties " , and that , mistress ,
you know is sworn quite away ; after their honesties was gone ,
then came they to their gentility , and swore " as they were
gentlemen " : and their gentility they swore away so fast ,
that they had almost sworn away all the ancient gentry out of
the land , which indeed are scarce missed , for that yeomen and
farmers ' sons , with the help of a few Welshmen , have undertook
to supply their places ; that at the last they came to silver ,
and their oath was " by the cross of this silver " : and
swore so fast upon that , that now they have scarce left them a
cross for to swear by .
And what do they swear by now their money is gone ?
Why , by and " God refuse them . "
And can they not as well say men refuse them , as God refuse them ?
No, mistress , for men , especially citizens and rich men , have
refused them their bonds and protestations already .
' Tis well ; see how supper goes forward , and that my shoes be very
well blacked against I go to the Family .
Now , sweet chick , where hast thou been ? In troth , la , I am not
well ; I had thought to have spent the morning at the Family , but
now I am resolved to take pills , and therefore I pray thee desire
Doctor Glister that 'a would minister to me in the morning .
Thy will is known ; and this for answer say ,
' Tis fit that wise men should their wives obey .
And now , sweet duck , know I have been for my cousin Gerardine 's
will and have it : 'a has given thee a legacy , but the total is
Maria 's .
Master Doctor , your wife and Master Dryfat are most welcome ; now
were my cousin Gerardine and Master Lipsalve here , our
number were complete .
Is this frantic will done ? will Master Gerardine to sea ? Let me
tell you I am no whit sorry ; let such as will be headstrong bite
on the bridle .
' Tis here , Master Doctor ; all his worth is Maria 's and locked
in a trunk , which by tomorrow sun shall be delivered to your custody .
Methinks 'twere a reasonable match to bestow your niece on Master
Gerardine : 'a is a most hopeful gentleman , and his revenue such ,
that having your niece 's portion to clear it of all incumbrances ,
'twill maintain them both in a very worthy degree .
Tut , you are Master Dryfat the merchant ; your skill is greater
in cony-skins and woolpacks than in gentlemen . His lands be in
statutes ; you merchants were wont to be merchant staplers , but
now gentlemen have gotten up the trade , for there is not one gentleman
amongst twenty but his land be engaged in twenty statutes staple .
Let every man his humour have ,
I do at none repine ;
I never regard whose wench I kiss ,
Nor who doth the like by mine :
Th' indifferent mind 's I hold still best ,
Whatever does befall ;
For she that will do with me and thee
Will be a wench for all .
And how goes the squares ?
Your stay , gentlemen , does wrong to a great many of good stomachs ;
your suppers expect you .
And we our suppers .
And from what good exercise come you three ?
From a play , where we saw most excellent Sampson excel the whole
world in gate-carrying .
Was it performed by the youths ?
By youths ? Why , I tell thee we saw Sampson , and I hope 'tis not
for youths to play Sampson . Believe it , we saw Sampson bear the
town-gates on his neck from the lower to the upper stage , with
that life and admirable accord that it shall never be equalled ,
unless the whole new livery of porters set their shoulders .
Fie , fie , 'tis pity young gentlemen can bestow their time no better ;
this playing is not lawful , for I cannot find that either plays
or players were allowed in the prime church of Ephesus by the
elders .
Aha , I think she tickled you there .
Cousin Gerardine , shall the will be read before supper ?
Before supper , I beseech you .
Ay , ay , before supper , for when these women 's bellies be full ,
their bones will be soon at rest .
Well , Master Doctor , pity the state of a poor gentleman : it is
in you to stay his journey , and make him and yourself happy in
his choice .
Hold you content . Shall this will be read ?
It shall . Read you , good Master Lipsalve .
Command silence then .
Silence .
" In the name of God , amen . Know
all men by these presents that I Gerardine , being strong of body
and perfect in sense--"
That 's false , there 's no lover in his perfect sense .
Peace , Dryfat .
" Do give and grant to Maria Glister , daughter of John Glister ,
and niece to Doctor Glister , physician , all my leases , lands ,
chattels , goods and moveables whatsoever . " This is stark
naught : you cannot give away your moveables , for Mistress Doctor
and Mistress Purge claim both shares in your moveables by reason
of their legacies .
That 's true , for their legacies must go out of your moveables .
Ay , put it in : " all my moveables , these following legacies
being paid . "
Do so , good Master Lipsalve .
' Tis done .
I pray read only the legacies , for supper stays .
Well , the legacies : " First , I give to my cousin , Mistress
Purge , a fair large standing--" What 's this ? O , cup : " a
fair large standing cup , with a closestool . "
' Tis not so , 'tis not so .
I cry you mercy : " a close cover " 'tis . " To Mistress
Doctor I give a fair bodkin of gold , with two orient pearls attending
the same : all which are in my trunk to be delivered to the keeping
of Maria . In witness , &amp;c . " Is this your will ?
' Tis .
To it with your hand and seal .
How is it , chick , I must have the standing
cup , and Mistress Glister the bodkin ?
Right , sweet duck .
I pray , gentlemen , put to your hands .
Come , your fists , gentlemen , your fists .
Mistress Glister ,
I have found you always more flexible to understand the estate
of a poor gentleman than your husband was willing ; therefore I
have thought it a point of charity to reveal the wrongs you sustain
by your husband 's looseness . Let me tell you in private that
the doctor cuckolds Purge oftener than he visits one of his patients ;
what 'a spares from you 'a spends lavishly on her . These pothecaries
are a kind of panders ; look to it : if 'a keep Maria long close ,
it is for some lascivious end of his own .
MISTRESS GLISTER
She is his niece .
Tut , these doctors have tricks . Your niceness is such that you
can endure no polluted shoes in your house ; take heed lest 'a
make you a bawd before your time , look to it .
Come , our hands are testimonies to thy follies . Shall 's now to
supper ? We 'll have a health go round to thy voyage .
Ay , and to all that forswear marriage , and can be content with
other men 's wives .
Of which consort you two are grounds : one touches the bass , and the other tickles the minikin .
But to our cheer ; come , gentles , let 's away ,
The roast meat 's in consumption by our stay .
The grey-eyed morning braves me to my face , and calls me sluggard ;
'tis time for tradesmen to be in their shops , for he that tends
well his shop , and hath an alluring wife with a graceful " what
d'ye lack " shall be sure to have good doings , and good doings
is that that crowns so many citizens with the horns of abundance .
My wife , by ordinary course , should this morning have been at
the Family , but now her soft pillow hath given her counsel to
keep her bed . Master Doctor should indeed minister to her : to
whose pills she is so much accustomed , that now her body looks
for them as duly as the moon shakes off the old and borrows new
horns . I smile to myself to hear our knights and gallants say
how they gull us citizens , when indeed we gull them , or rather
they gull themselves . Here they come in term-time , hire chambers ,
and perhaps kiss our wives : well , what lose I by that ? God 's
blessing on 's heart , I say still , that makes much of my wife ;
for they were very hard-favoured that none could find in 's heart
to love but ourselves . Drugs would be dog-cheap , but for my private
well-practised doctor and such customers . Tut , jealousy is a
hell , and they that will thrive must utter their wares as they
can , and wink at small faults .
The tedious night is past , and the jocund morn looks more lively
and fresh than an old gentlewoman 's glazed face in a new periwig .
By this time my humorous lover is at Gravesend , and I go with
more joy to fetch his trunk than ever the valiant Trojans did
to draw in the Grecian jade ; his gods shall into the walls of my
Troy , and be offered to a face more lovely than ever was that thrice-ravished Helen : yet with such caution that no danger shall
happen to me .
Master Lipsalve , welcome within ken ; we two are so nearly linked ,
that if thou beest absent but one two hours , thy acquaintance
grows almost mouldy in my memory .
And thine fly-blown in mine ; how dost thou do ?
Fellow page , I think our acquaintance runs low too ; but if it
run not o ' the lees , let 's set it a-tilt , and give 'em some dregs
to their mouldy , fly-blown compliments .
No, rather let 's pierce the rundlets of our running heads , and
give 'em a neat cup of wagship to put down their courtship .
Courtship ? cartship : for the tongues of complimenters run on wheels .
But mark 'em , they ha' not done yet .
And i'faith how is't ? Methinks thou hast been a long vagrant .
The rogation hath been long indeed : therefore we may salute as
ceremoniously as lawyers when they meet after a long vacation ,
who , to renew the discontinued state tale , they stretch it out
with such length , that whilst they greet before , their clients
kiss them behind .
If his nose were put i' the remainder of that state tale , he would
say 'twere an unsavoury one .
I wonder why many men gird so at the law .
I 'll tell thee , because they themselves have neither law nor conscience .
But what news now ? How stands the state of things at Brussels ?
Faith , weak and limber , weak and limber ; nothing but pride and
double-dealing . Virtue is vice 's lackey ; beggars suck like horse-leeches at the heart of bounty , and leaves him so tired
and spur-galled that he can be no longer ridden with honesty .
Well fare the city yet . There virtue rides a cock-horse , cherished
and kept warm in good sables and fox-fur , and with the breath
of his nostrils drives pride and covetousness before him , like 's
own shadow . Beggars have whipping cheer : bounty obliges men to't ,
and liberality gives money for scrips and scrolls , sealed with
strong arms and heraldry to outlive mortality . Love there will
see the last man born , never give over while there 's an arrow
i' th ' quiver .
Now we talk of love , I do know not far hence so good a subject
for that humour , that if she would wear but the standing collar
and her things in fashion , our ladies in the court were but brown
sugar-candy , as gross as grocery to her .
She is not so sweet as a pothecary 's shop , is she ?
A plague on you , ha' you so good a scent ? For
my life , he 's my rival .
Her name begins with Mistress Purge , does it not ?
True , the only comet of the city .
Ay , if she would let her ruffs stream out a little wider ; but
I am sure she is ominous to me : she makes civil wars and insurrections
in the state of my stomach . I had thought to have bound myself
from love , but her purging comfits makes me loose-bodied still .
What , has she ministered to thee then ?
Faith , some lectuary or so .
Ay , I fear she takes too much of that lectuary to stoop to love ; it keeps her body soluble from sin : she is not troubled with carnal
crudities nor the binding of the flesh .
Thou hast sounded her then , belike .
Not I , I am too shallow to sound her , she 's out of my element .
If I show passion and discourse of love to her , she tells me
I am wide from the right scope ; she says she has another object ,
and aims at a better love than mine .
0, that 's her husband .
No, no , she speaks pure devotion ; she 's impenetrable : no gold
or oratory , no virtue in herbs nor no physic will make her love .
More is the pity , I say , that fair women should prove saints before
age had made them crooked . ' Tis my luck to be
crossed still , but I must not give over the chase .
Come hither , boy , while I think on't
Faith , friend Lipsalve , I perceive you would fain
play with my love . A pure creature 'tis , for whom I have sought
every angle of my brain ; but either she scorns courtiers as most
of them do , because they are given to boast of their doings , or
else she 's exceeding strait-laced . Therefore to prevent this
smell-smock , I 'll to my friend Doctor Glister , a man exquisite
in th ' art magic , who hath told me of many rare experiments available
in this case.--Farewell , friend Lipsalve .
Adieu , honest Gregory ; frequent my lodging , I have a viol de gambo
and good tobacco .
Thou wilt do this feat , boy ?
Else knock my head and my pate together .
Away then ; bid him bring his measure with him .
Gerardine is travelled , and I must needs be cast into his mould .
My flesh grows proud , and Maria 's a sweet wench , &amp;c . But
I 'll rather to my learned doctor for a spell ,
For I have a fire in my liver burns like hell .
I pray let 's have no polluted
feet nor rheumatic chaps enter the house ; I shall have my floor
look more greasy shortly than one of your inn-of-court dining-tables .
And now to you , good niece , I bend my speech :
let me tell you plainly , you are a fool to be love-sick for any
man longer than he is in your company ; are you so ignorant in
the rules of courtship , to think any one man to bear all the prick
and praise ? I tell thee , be he never so proper , there is another
to second him .
Let rules of courtship be authentic still
To such as do pursue variety ;
But unto those whose modest thoughts do tend
To honour 'd nuptials and a regular life ,
As far from show of niceness as from that
Of impure thoughts , all other objects seem
Respectless , of no proportion , balanc 'd with esteem
Of what their souls affect .
No marvel sure you should regard these men with such reverend
opinion : there 's few good faces and fewer graces in any of them ;
if one among a multitude have a good pair of legs , he never leaves
riding the ring till he has quite marred the proportion . Nay ,
some , as I have heard , wanting lineaments to their liking and
calf to support themselves , are fain to use art , and supply themselves
with quilted calves , which oftentimes in revelling fall about
their ankles ; and for their behaviour , wit and discourse ( except
some few that are travelled ) it is as imperfectious and silly
as your scholars new come from the university . By this light ,
I think we lose part of our happiness when we make these weathercocks
our equals .
Disgrace not that for which our sect was made ,
Society in nuptial beds ; above these joys
Which lovers taste when their conjoined lips
Suck forth each other 's souls , the earth , the air ,
Yea gods themselves , know none . Elysiums sweet ,
Ay , all that bliss which poets ' pens describe ,
Are only known when soft and amorous folds
Entwine the corps of two united lovers ,
Where what they wish they have , yet still desire ,
And sweets are known without satiety .
VIAL
Here 's Club , forsooth , and his fellow prentice have brought Master
Gerardine 's trunk .
Let them come in if their feet be clean .
So then , your best-beloved is gone : fair weather after him ! All
thy passions go with him . Recomfort thyself , wench , in a better
choice : his love to thee would have been of no longer continuance
than the untrussing of his hose ; then why shouldst thou pine for
such a one ?
She 's foolish sure ; with what imperfect phrase
And shallow wit she answers me .
Honest Club , welcome ; is this Master Gerardine 's trunk ? He is
gone then ?
Ay , indeed , Mistress Glister , he is departed this transitory city ,
but his whole substance is here enclosed ; which , by command , we
here deliver to your custody , to the use of Mistress Maria , according
to the tenor of the premises .
Place it here , my honest Club , well done . And how does thy mistress ?
Was she at the Family today ?
Spit not , good Club , I cannot abide it .
Not today , forsooth : she hath over-charged herself and her memory ;
she means to use a moderation , and take no more than she can make
use of .
And I prithee , Club , what kind of creatures are these Familists ?
Thou art conversant with them .
What are they ? With reverence be it spoken , they are the most
accomplished creatures under heaven ; in them is all perfection .
As how , good Club ?
Omitting their outward graces , I 'll show you only one instance ,
which includes all other : they love their neighbours better than
themselves .
Not than themselves , Club .
Yes , better than themselves , for they love them better than their
husbands , and husband and wife are all one ; therefore better than
themselves .
This is logic . But tell me , doth she not endeavour to bring my
doctor of her side and fraternity ?
Let him resolve that himself , for here he comes .
0, hast thou brought the trunk , honest Club ? I commend thy honest
care ; here 's for thy pains .
I thank you , Master Doctor , you are free and liberal still ; you 'll
command me nothing back ?
Nothing but commendations ; farewell .
Your sweetheart Gerardine is by this time cold of his hope to
enjoy thee : he 's gone , and a more equal and able husband shall
my care ere long provide thee . What clients have been here in
my absence , wife ?
Faith , mouse , none that I know more than an old woman that had
lost her cat , and came to you for a spell in the recovery .
I think egregious ignorance will go near to save this age ; their
blindness takes me for a conjuror . Yesterday a justice of peace
salutes me with proffer of a brace of angels to help him to his
footcloth , some three days before stolen , and was fain to use
his man 's cloak instead on't .
Here 's a gentleman craves speech with you , sir .
Go in , sweet wife , and give my niece good counsel .
His name ?
He will not tell it me .
His countenance ?
I can see nothing but his eyes ; the rest of him is so wrapped
in cloak that it suffers no view .
Admit him .
What should he be for a man ?
What , Master Lipsalve , is't you ? Why thus obscured ? What discontent
overshadows you ?
A discontent indeed , Master Doctor , which to shake off I must
have you extend your art to the utmost bounds . You physicians
are as good as false doors behind hangings to ladies ' necessary
uses : you know the very hour in which they have neither will to
deny nor wit to mistrust ; faith now , by the way , when are women
most apt ?
Shall I unbutton myself unto you ? After the receipt of a purgation ,
for then are their pores most open . But what creature of a courtier
is it hath drawn your head into the woodcock 's noose ?
A courtier ? Nay , by this flesh , I am clean fallen out with them ;
they have nothing proportionable .
0, I perceive , then 'tis some city star that attracts your aspect .
He knows by his art.--In plain terms , a certain
pothecary 's wife .
Upon my life , Master Purge ; I smell you , sir .
You may smell a man after a purgation indeed ; sir , 'tis she .
Now , for that fame hath bruited you to be a man expert in necromancy ,
I would endear myself to you for ever , would you vouchsafe to
let one of your spirits bring Mistress Purge into some convenient
place , where I might enjoy her . I have heard of the like ; can
you perform this ?
With much facility , I assure you ; but you must understand that
the apparition of a spirit is dreadful , and withal covetous , and
with no small sum of gold hired to such feats .
Sir , here 's another gentleman , muffled too , that desires present
conference with you .
Walk you into that room ; I will bethink myself for your good ,
and instantly resolve you .
Let the gentleman come in .
Lipsalve in love with my vessel of ease ? Come to me to help him
to a morsel most affected by mine own palate ? No more but so .
I have shaped it ; the conceit tickles me .
Sir , as a stranger I welcome you--what , Master Gudgeon , have I
caught you ? I thought it was a gallant that walked muffled .
Come , let me behold you at full ; here are no sergeants , man .
Master Doctor , this my obscure coming requires an action more
obscure ; and , in brief , this 'tis . Sir , you are held a man far
seen in nature 's secrets ; I know you can effect many things almost
impossible : know then , I love Mistress Purge , and opportunity
favours me not , nor indeed is she so tractable as I expected ,
if either by medicine or your art magical you can work her to
my will , I have a poor gallant 's reward , sir .
That 's just nothing.--But how , sir , would you
have me to procure you access to Mistress Purge ? You never knew
a physician a bawd .
Why , by conjuration , I tell you , wherein you are said to be as
well practised as in physic ; here 's the best part of my present
store to effect it .
Not a penny for myself ; but my spirits , indeed they must be fed .
Walk you by here , while I think upon a spell .
What mystery should this be ? Lipsalve and Gudgeon both in love
with Mistress Purge , and come to me to help 'em by art magic ?
' Tis some gullery sure ; yet if my invention hold , I 'll fit them.--Who 's
within there ?
Fetch me in all haste two good whips ; I think you may have them
not far hence .
It shall be so.--Now tell me , Master Gudgeon ,
does no man know of your love to Mistress Purge ?
Not a man , by my gentry .
Then , sir , know I 'll effect it ; but understand withal the apparition
will be most horrid if it appear in his proper form , and will
so amaze and dull your senses , that your appetite will be lost
and weak , though Mistress Purge should attend it naked . Now ,
sir , could you name a friend with whom you are most conversant ,
in his likeness should the spirit appear .
Of all men living my conversation is most frequent with Lipsalve
the courtier .
' Tis enough . I 'll to my spirit .
Are these whips come there ?
Ready here , sir .
So , lie thou
there . My noble gallants , I 'll so firk you.--Sir ,
my spirit agrees in Lipsalves shape . Tomorrow , 'twixt the hours
of four and five , shall Mistress Purge be rapt with a whirlwind
into Lipsalve 's chamber : that 's the fittest place , for by the
break of day Lipsalve shall be mounted and forsake the city for
three days ; so my spirit resolves me . Now , sir , by my art , at
that very hour shall his chamber-door fly open ; into which boldly
enter in this sort accoutred : put me on a pure clean shirt , leave
off your doublet ( for spirits endure nothing polluted ) , take me
this whip in your hand , and being entered
you shall see the spirit in Lipsalve 's shape , in the self-same
soundly , who straight vanisheth and leaves Mistress Purge to your
will .
Ay , but shall your spirit come armed with a whip too ?
He shall , but have no power to strike .
Is this infallible ? Have you seen the proof ?
upon my word , I have seen the experience ; if
it fail , say I am a fool , and no magician .
Master Doctor , I would you had some suit at court ; by the faith
of a courtier , I would beg it for you . Fare you well , sir ; I
shall report of you as I find your charm .
And no otherwise , sir ; let me understand how you thrive .
Ha , ha , ha ! Now to my friend Lipsalve ; I must possess him with
the same circumstance , wherein I am assured to get perpetual laughter
in their follies and my revenge .
0, which way shall I turn , or shift , or go ,
To lose one thought of care ? No soothing hope
Gives intermission , or beguiles one hour
Of tedious time , which never will have end ,
Whilst love pursues in vain my absent friend .
Thou continent of wealth , whose want of store ,
For that it could not peize th ' unequal scale
Of avarice , giv'st matter to my moan .
0 dross , the level of insatiate eyes ,
The devil 's engine and the soul 's corrupter ,
Thou play 'st th ' attorney 'gainst the lawful force
Of true affection , dost interpose a bar
' Twixt hearts conjoin 'd : curs 'd be thy seed of strife ,
Whose progress chokes the natural course of life !
0, help , help , help !
Stay , sweet Maria , I bring thee ample joy
To check that sudden fear ; let thy sweet heart ,
That constant seat of thy affection ,
Repay that blood exhausted from thy veins .
Fear not , sweet wench ; I am no apparition ,
But the firm substance of thy truest friend :
Know 'st thou me now ?
Gerardine my love ?
What unheard-of accident presents
Thy unexpected self , and gives my heart
Matter of joy , mix 'd with astonishment ?
I thought thou hadst been cabin 'd in thy ship ,
Not trunk 'd within my cruel guardian 's house .
That cruelty gives fuel to desire ,
For love suppress 'd fares like a raging fire
Which burns all obstacles that stop his course ,
And mounts aloft . The ocean in his source
May easier hide himself and be confin 'd
Than love can be obscur 'd ; for in the mind
She holds her seat , and through that heavenly essence
Is near when far remote ; her virtual presence
Fills , like the air , all places , gives delight ,
Hope in despair , and heart 'gainst fell despite .
That worst of men , thy cruel guardian , may
Keep down awhile , but cannot dissipate
What heaven hath join 'd : for fate and providence
Gave me this stratagem , to let him know
That love will creep where 'tis restrain 'd to go .
I apprehend the rest . 0 rare conceit !
I see thy travel happily was feign 'd
To win access , which with small ease thou hast gain 'd .
This trunk , which he so greedily supposes
Contains thy substance ( as it doth indeed ) ,
Upon thy fair pretence in lieu of love
Bequeath 'd to me if death should stop the course ,
This trunk , I say , he hugs ; sink thou or swim ,
So he may feed his wolf , that root of sin ,
His avarice ; but heaven , that mocks man 's might ,
Gives this close means t ' insist upon our right .
Ingenious spirit , true oracle of love ,
Thou hast prevented me . This was my plot ,
Whose end and scope I long to imitate
With accents free , and uncontroll 'd with fear .
Does opportunity stand fair ?
Not now ,
Danger stands sentinel .
Then I 'll retire ;
We must be cautelous .
So , so ; and time
Shall not oft turn his hour-glass ere I 'll find
Peace and occasion fitting to thy mind .
The coast is clear , and Argus ' wakeful eyes
Securely sleep : time turns to us his front .
Come sweet Maria , of th ' auspicious hours
Let 's take advantage .
With all my heart ;
I do embrace the motion with thyself .
Welcome sweet friend to liberty of air ,
Which now , methinks , doth prompt our breaths to move
Sweet accents of delight , the joys of love .
How dost thou brook thy little-ease , thy trunk ?
That trunk confines this chest ; this chest contains
Th' unbounded speculation of our love
Incomprehensible : grief , joy , hope and fears ,
Th' affections of my mind , are like the spheres ,
Which in their jarring motions do agree ,
Through th ' influence of love 's sweet harmony .
Are not inferior bodies here on earth
Produc 'd and govern 'd by those heavenly ones ?
They are .
They jar , you say , yet in that strife maintain
Perpetual league : why should their influence
In rational souls be check 'd by erring sense ?
Or why should mutual love , confirm 'd by heaven ,
B' infring 'd by men ? Methinks 'tis most uneven .
Thou argu 'st well , Maria ; and this withal ,
That brutes nor animals do prove a thrall
To such servility : souls that are wards
To gold , opinion , or th ' undue regards
Of broking men , wolves that in sheepskin bands
Prey on the hearts to join th ' unwilling hands ,
Ruin fair stocks , when generous houses die ,
Or propagate their name with bastardy .
Sterility and barrenness ensue
Such forced love ; nor shall erroneous men
Pervert my settled thoughts , or turn mine eye
From thy fair object , which I will pursue ,
Rich in thy love , proud of this interview .
I 'll suck these accents ; let our breaths engender
A generation of such pleasing sounds ,
To interchange delights . 0, my blood 's on fire !
Sweet , let me give more scope to true desire .
What wouldst thou more than our minds ' firm contract ?
Tut , words are wind ; thought unreduced to act
Is but an embryon in the truest sense .
I am beleaguer 'd , I had need of sense ;
You make me blush : play fair , yet above board .
Hear me exemplify love 's Latin word
Together with thyself ,
As thus : hearts join 'd , take A from thence ,
Then is the perfect moral sense :
Plural in manners , which in thee do shine
Saint-like , immortal , spotless and divine .
Take M away , in beauty 's name
Craves an eternal trophy to thy fame .
Lastly , take 0, in stands all my rest ,
Which I in Chaucer-style do term a jest .
You break all modest bounds ; away , away !
So when men come behind do women say .
Come , come , I say--
Ay , that 's the word indeed ;
Men that come bold before are like to speed .
But who comes here ? My nostrils have
the rank scent of knavery . Maria , let 's remove ourselves to the
window , and observe this piece of man 's flesh .
Now Mistress Maria , ward yourself ; if my strong hope fail not ,
I shall be with you to bring--
To bring what , sir ? Some more o ' your kind ?
Faith , boy , that 's mine aim .
I 'll be sworn , sir , you have a good loose ; you let fly at 'em
apace .
I have shot fair and far off ; but now I hope to hit the mark indeed .
God save it .
But where 's the sign ?
Why , there .
That 's a special thing to be observed .
I have heard talk of the Gemini ; methinks that should be a star
favourable to your proceeding .
The Gemini ? 0, I apprehend thee : that 's because I am so like
Gerardine ; ha , is't not so , boy ?
As if you were spit out on 's mouth , sir ; you must needs be like
him , for you are both cut out of a piece . But lord , sir , how
you hunt this chase of love ; are you not weary ?
Indefatigable , boy , indefatigable .
Fatigable , quoth you ? You may call it leanable well enough , for
I am sure it is able to make a man lean .
' Tis my vocation , boy ; we must never be weary of well-doing : love 's
as proper to a courtier as preciseness to a puritan .
Boy , I have spied my saint .
Then down on your knees .
Fly off , lest she take thee for my familiar .
Save thee , sweet Maria !
Nay wonder not ( for thou thyself art wonder )
To see this unexpected gratulation .
Whom do I see ? 0, how my senses wander !
Am not I Hero ? Art not thou Leander ?
Th' art in the right , sweet wench ; more of that
vein .
Her passion overcomes her ; 'tis the kindest
soul ! O excellent device ; it works , it works , boy .
It does indeed , sir , like the suds of an ale-fat or a washing-bowl .
Joy not too much ; extremes are perilous .
0 weather-beaten love ! Cisley , go make a fire ;
Go fetch my ladder of ropes , Leander 's come .
Mark , how prettily in her rapture she harps upon
Gerardine 's travel.--Let th ' ecstasy have end , for I am Gerardine .
The devil you are .
Ha ? let me see ; my love so soon return 'd ?
I never travell 'd farther than thine eyes ;
My bruited journey was a happy project
To cast a mist before thy jealous guardian ,
Who now suspectless gives some hope t ' attain
My wish 'd delight , before pursu 'd in vain .
Ask if he strain 'd not hard for that
same project .
Has not that project overrack 'd thy brain ,
And spent more wit than thou hast left behind ?
By this light , she flouts him .
No, wit is infinite : I spent some brain ;
Thy love did stretch my wit upon the tenters .
Then is't like to shrink in the wetting .
It cottons well ; it cannot choose but bear
A pretty nap . I tender thy capacity ;
A comfortable caudle cherish it .
But where 's my favour that I bid thee wear
As pledge of love ?
Now dost thou put him to't ;
More tenters for his wit ; he 's quite .
I wear it , sweet Maria , but on high days ,
Preserve it from the tainting of the air--
What should I say?--'Tis in my t 'other hose .
How ? In your t 'other hose ? He that I love
Shall wear my favour in those hose he has on .
Fiends and furies ! Block that I am !
Aside to Lipsalve In your t 'other hose ? Aside She talked
of a ladder of ropes ; if she would let it down , for my life he
would hang himself in't.--In your t 'other hose ? Why , those hose
are in lavender ; besides , they have never a codpiece : but indeed
there needs no ivy where the wine is good . In your t 'other hose ?
I said you were too prodigal of wit .
Expostulate no more ; grant me access ,
Or else I 'll travel to the wilderness .
Your only way . Go , travel till you tire ;
Be rid , and let a gull discharge the hire .
Master , the doctor , the doctor !
Where ? Which way ?
This way , that way , some way I heard him coming .
0 boy , I am abused , gulled , disgraced ; my credit 's cracked .
You know that 's nothing for a new courtier .
0, I shall run beside myself .
No sir , that 's my office ; I 'll run by your side .
My brain is out of temper ; what shall I do ?
Take her counsel , sir ; get a cullis to your capacity , a restorative
to your reason , and a warming-pan to your wit . He comes , he comes !
Follow close , boy ; let him not see us .
What , more flatterers about my carrion ? More battery to my walls ?
Shall I never be rid of these Petronel Flashes ? As for my friend
Gerardine , the wind of my rage has blown him to discover countries ;
and let the sea purge his love away and him together , I care not .
Young wenches now are all o ' the hoigh . We that are guardians
must respect more besides titles , gold lace , person , or parts ;
we must have lordships and manors elsewhere as well as in the
man . Wealth commands all ; and wealth I 'll have , or else my minion
shall lead apes in hell . I must after this gallant too ; I 'll
know his rendezvous , and what company he keeps .
Now must we be abrupt ; retire , sweet friend ,
To thy small-ease . What more remains to do
We 'll consummate at our next interview .
So shall I bear my prisonment with pleasure ;
Look thou but big , our cruel foe will yield ,
And give to Hymen th ' honour of the field .
Fie , fie , Club , go a' t 'other side the way , thou collowest me
and my ruff ; thou wilt make me an unclean member i' the congregation .
If you be unclean , mistress , you may pure yourself ; you have my
master 's ware at your commandment ; but what am I then , that does
all the drudgery in your house ?
Th' art born to't ; why , boy , I can show thy indentures ; thou givest
no other milk . We know how to use all i' their kind .
You 're my better in bark and rine , but in pith and substance I
may compare with you . You 're above me in flesh , mistress , and
there 's your boast ; but in my t 'other part we are all one before
God .
All one with me ? Dost thou swear too ? Why then , up and ride !
Whither away , Mistress Purge ?
To the Family , Master Dryfat , to our exercise .
What , by night ?
0 Lord , ay , sir , with the candles out too ; we fructify best i'
th ' dark . The glance of the eye is a great matter ; it leads us
to other objects besides the right .
Indeed , I think we perform those functions best when we are not
thrall to the fetters of the body .
The fetters of the body ? What call you them ?
The organs of the body , as some term them .
Organs ? Fie , fie , they have a most abominable squeaking sound
in mine ears ; they edify not a whit , I detest 'em . I hope my
body has no organs .
To speak more familiarly , Mistress Purge , they are the senses :
the sight , hearing , smelling , taste and feeling .
Ay , marry . Marry , said I ? Lord , what a word 's that in my mouth .
You speak now , Master Dryfat , but yet let me tell you where you
err too : this feeling I will prove to be neither organ nor fetter ;
it is a thing--a sense did you call it ?
Ay , a sense .
Why then , a sense let it be . I say it is that we cannot be without :
for , as I take it , it is a part belonging to understanding ; understanding ,
you know , lifteth up the mind from earth ; if the mind be lift
up , you know the body goes with it . Also it descends into the
conscience , and there tickles us with our works and doings , so
that we make singular use of feeling .
And not of the rest ?
Not at that time ; therefore we hold it not amiss to put out the
candles , for the soul sees best i' th ' dark .
You come to me now , Mistress Purge .
Nay , I will come to you else , Master Dryfat . These senses , as
you term them , are of much efficacy in carnal mixtures ; that is ,
when we crowd and thrust a man and a woman together .
What , so close at it ? I thought this was one
end of your exercise . Byrlady , I think there is small profit
in this . I 'll wink no more , for I am now tickled with a conceit
that it is a scurvy thing to be a cuckold .
I commend this zeal in you , Mistress Purge ; I desire much to be
of your society .
Do you indeed ? Blessing on your heart . Are you upright in your
dealings ?
Yes , I do love to stand to any thing I do , though I lose by it ;
in truth , I deal but too truly for this world . You shall hear
how far I am entered in the right way already . First , I live
in charity and give small alms to such as be not of the right
sect ; I take under twenty i' th ' hundred , nor no forfeiture of
bonds unless the law tell my conscience I may do 't ; I set no pot
on a' Sundays , but feed on cold meat dressed a' Saturdays ; I keep
no holydays nor fasts , but eat most flesh o ' Fridays of all days
i' the week ; I do use to say inspired graces able to starve a
wicked man with length ; I have Aminadabs and Abrahams to my godsons ,
and I chide them when they ask me blessing ; and I do hate the
red letter more than I follow the written verity .
Here 's clergy .
These are the rudiments indeed , Master Dryfat .
Nay , I can tell you I am , or will be , of the right stamp .
A pox o ' your stamp .
Then learn the word for your admittance , and you will be much
made on by the congregation .
Ay , the word , good Mistress Purge .
A Brother in the Family .
Enough , I have my lesson .
So have I mine : a Brother in the Family ; I must
be a Familist today . I 'll follow this gear while 'tis on foot ,
i'faith .
Then shore up your eyes , and lead the way to the goodliest people
that ever turned up the white o ' th ' eye . Give me my book , Club ,
put out thy link , and come behind us .
Who 's there ?
Two Brothers and a Sister in the Family .
Who 's there ?
A Familiar Brother .
Here 's no room for you nor your familiarity .
How ? No room for me nor my familiarity ? Why , what 's the difference
between a Familiar Brother and a Brother in the Family ? 0, I know : I made ellipsis of "in " in this
place where it should have been expressed , so that the want of
"in " put me clean out ; or , let me see : may it not be
some mystery drawn from arithmetic ? For my life , these Familists
love no subtraction , take nothing away , but put in and add as
much as you will ; and after addition follows multiplication of
a most Pharasithypocritical crew . Well , for my part I like not
this Family , nor indeed some kind of private lecturing that women
use . Look to't , you that have such gadders to your wives : self-willed
they are as children , and , i'faith , capable of not much more than
they , peevish by custom , naturally fools . I remember a pretty
wooden sentence in a preamble to an exercise , where the reader
prayed that men of his coat might grow up like cedars to make
good wainscot in the House of Sincerity ; would not this wainscot
phrase be writ in brass , to publish him that spake it for an animal ?
Why , such wooden pellets out of earthen trunks do strike these
females into admiration , hits 'em home ; sometimes , perhaps , in
at one ear and out at t 'other ; and then they depart , in opinion
wiser than their neighbours , fraught with matter able to take
down and mortify their husbands . Well , I 'll home now , and bring
the true word next time . I shall expect my wife anon , red-hot
with zeal and big with melting tears ; and this night do I expect ,
as her manner is , she will weep me a whole chamber-pot full .
Do I cast pills abroad ? ' Tis no matter
what I say ; I talk like a pothecary , as I am ; I have only purged
myself of a little choler and passion , and am now armed with a
patient resolution . But how ? To put my horns in my pocket ?
No:
What wise men bear is not for me to scorn ;
' Tis an honourable thing to wear the horn .
Fortune , devil 's turd i' thy teeth ! I 'll turn no more o ' thy
wheel ; art is above thy might . What though my project with Mistress
Maria failed ? More ways to the wood than one : there 's variety
in love . It is believed I am out of town ; my door is open , the
hour is at hand ; all things squared by the doctor 's rule ; and
now I look for the spirit to bring me warm comfort to clothe my
nakedness , and that is Mistress Purge , the cordial of a Familist ;
and come quickly , good spirit , or else my teeth will chatter for
thee .
0 the naked pastimes of love , the scourge of dullness , the purifier
of uncleanness , and the hot-house of humanity ! I have taken physic
of Master Purge any time this twelve months to purge my humour
upon 's wife , and I have ever found her so fugitive , from exercise
to exercise , and from Family to Family , that I could never yet
open the closestool of my mind to her ; so that I may well say
of conjuration ; if it hit , and that I yerk my Familist out of
the spirit , I 'll hang up my scourge-stick for a trophy , and emparadize
my thoughts ; though the doctor go to the devil , 'tis no matter .
Ha , let me see : Lipsalve 's door open , and himself out of town ?
Excellent doctor , soothsaying doctor , oraculous doctor !
I have taken up this standing to see my gallants
play at barriers with scourge-sticks , for the honour of my punk .
And in good time I see my brave spirits shining in bright armour ,
nakedly burning in the hell-fire of lechery , and ready for the
hot encounter . Sound trumpets , the combatants are mounted .
The apparition ! Mistress Purge peers through him ; I see her .
The spirit appears ! But he might have come sooner : I am numbed
with cold , a shivering ague hath taken away my courage .
They are afraid one of another ; look how they
tremble ; the flesh and the devil strengthen 'em ! Ha , ha , ha !
Has 'a no cloven feet ? What a laxative fever shakes me .
Will 'a not carry me with him to hell ? Well , I must venture :
My cue :
My cue :
With a
Hold , hold , hold !
Gogs nowns , gogs blood !
A pox , a plague , the devil take you !
Truce , truce , I smart , I smart .
Ha , ha , ha ! 0, for one of the hoops of my Cornelius '
tub !
I must needs be gone , I shall burst myself with laughing else .
Magic hath no such rule ; men cannot find
Lust ever better handled in his kind .
What art thou ? With the name of Jove I conjure thee !
With any name , saving the whip ; I 'll no more of that conjuration ,
a plague on't !
Speak , art not a spirit in the likeness of my friend Lipsalve ,
that should transform thyself to Mistress Purge ?
How , a spirit ? I hope spirits have no flesh and blood ; and I
am sure thou hast drawn blood out of my flesh with the spirit
of thy whip .
Then shall we prove to be honest gulls , and the doctor an errant
knave .
A plague upon him for a Glister ! He has given our loves a suppositor
with a I 'll tell thee , sirrah--
Tell not me , let me prevent thee ; the wind shall not take the
breath of our gross abuse ; we feel the gullery . Therefore let
us swear by our naked truths , and by the hilts of these our blades ,
our flesh-tamers , to be revenged upon that paraperopandentical
doctor , that pocky doctor .
LlPSALVE
Agreed ; we 'll cuckold him , that he shall not be able to put his
head in at 's doors ; and make his precise , puritanical and peculiar
punk , his pothecary 's drug there , a known cockatrice to the world .
If report catch this knavery , we have lost our reputations for
ever ; wherefore let 's be secret .
Ill tax we women of credulity ,
When men are gull 'd with such gross foppery .
Come , let us in and cover both our shames .
This conjuration to the world 's a novelty ;
Gallants turn 'd spirits and whipped for lechery .
Gerardine , come forth , Maria calls !
Those ribs shall not enfold thy buxom limbs
One minute longer : the cincture of mine arms
Shall more securely keep thy soul from harms .
What heavenly breath of Phitonessa 's power ,
That raised the dead corpse of her friend to life ,
Prevails no less on me ; for even this urn ,
The figure of my sadder requiem ,
Gives up my bones , my love , my life , and all ,
To her that gives me freedom in my thrall .
Be brief , sweet friend , salute and part in one ;
For niggard time now threats with imminent danger
Our late joy 'd scope . Thy earnest , then , of love ,
Ere Sol have compass 'd half the signs , I fear
Will show a blushing fault ; but 'twas thine aim ,
T' enforce consent in him that bars thy claim .
Love salves that fault ; let time our guilt reveal ,
I 'll ne 'er deny my deed , my hand and seal .
The elements shall lose their ancient force ,
Water and earth suppress the fire and air ,
Nature in all use a preposterous course ,
Each kind forget his likeness to repair ,
Before I 'll falsify my faith to thee .
The humorous body 's elemental kind
Shall sooner lose th ' innated heat of love ,
The soul in nature 's bounds shall be confin 'd ,
Heaven 's course shall retrograde and leave to move ,
Ere I surcease to cherish mutual fire ,
With thoughts refin 'd in flames of true desire .
These words are odours in the sacred shrine
Of love 's best deity . The marriage-god
Longs to perform these ceremonious rites
Which terminate our hopes ; till mine grow full ,
I 'll use that intercourse amongst my friends
That erst I did . Then in the height of joy ,
I 'll come to challenge interest in my boy .
Till then , farewell .
You 'll come upon your cue ?
Doubt not of that .
Then twenty times adieu .
Come boys , our clothes , boys ; and what is the most current news ,
Periwinkle ?
Faith , sir , fortune hath favoured us with no news but what the
pedlar brought from Norfolk .
Is there nothing stirring at court , Shrimp ?
Faith , there is , sir , but nothing new .
Good wag , faith , thou smellest somewhat of
a courtier , though thy mother was a citizen 's wife . Off with that
filthy great band , nay , quick ; on with your robe of sanctity ,
nay , suddenly , man .
And why must we shift ourselves into this demure habit , if impossible
to be of the Family and keep our own fashion ?
Tut , man , the name of a gallant is more hateful to them than the sight of a corner-cap . Hadst thou heard the protestations the wife of a bellows-mender made but yesternight against gallants ,
thou hadst for ever abjured crimson breeches . She swore that
all gallants were persons inferior to bellows-menders , for the
trade of bellows-making was very aerial and high ; and what were
men and women but bellows , for they take wind in at one place
and do evaporate at another ; evaporate was her very phrase .
Methinks , her phrase flew with somewhat too strong a vapour .
Nay , she proves farther , that all men receive their being chiefly
from bellows , without which the fire burns not ; without fire the
pot seethes not ; the pot not seething , powdered beef is not to
be eaten ; of which she then averred our nation was a great devourer ,
and without which they could neither fight for their country abroad ,
nor get children at home ; for , said she , powdered beef is a great
joiner of nerves together .
What answer madest thou ?
Marry , that I thought a bawd was a greater joiner of nerves together
than powdered beef ; with that she protested that a bawd was an
instrument of the devil , and as she had proved that bellows-makers
were of God 's trade , so bawds were of the devil 's trade : for ( and
thereupon she blew her nose ) the devil and bawds did both live
by the sins of the people .
No more ; Mistress Purge is at hand .
Vanish boys , away . Make haste ; before Jove , she 'll be with us ere we can be provided for her .
Advance your link , Club . At what time wert thou bound , Club ?
At Guttide , Hollantide or Candletide ?
I was bound indeed about midsummer .
And when hath thy prenticeship end ? At Michaeltide next ?
So I take it .
They say , Club , you fall very heavy on such you love not ; you
never learnt that of me .
Indeed , mistress , I must confess my falling is rustic , gross and
butcher-like ; marry , yours is a pretty , foolish , light , courtlike
falling . Yet believe me , my master smells somewhat too gross
of the purgation ; he wants tutoring .
And why , I pray ?
My master being set last night in his shop , comes Master Doctor
Glister , as his manner is , squirting in suddenly ; and after some
conference , tells my master that by his own knowledge you were
young with child ; to which my master replied : " Why , Master
Doctor , will you put me to more charges yet ? "
Thou art a fool , in that my husband spake as wisely as if the
master of his company had spoke . He knows doctors have receipts
for women , which makes them most apt to conceive ; and he promising
a' had ministered the same lately to me , thereupon spake it .
Lead on with your link .
Art ready ?
Ready .
Then speak pitifully , look scurvily , and
dissemble cunningly , and we shall quickly prove two of the Fraternity.--Benediction
and sanctity , love and charity fall on Mistress Purge , Sister
of the Family .
And what , I pray , be you two ?
Two newly converted from the rags of Christianity to become good
members in the house of the Family .
Who , I pray , converted you ?
GUDGEON
Master Dryfat the merchant .
And from what sins hath he converted you ?
From two very notorious crimes ; the first was from eating fish
on Fridays , and the second from speaking reverently of the clergy .
But a' resolved us your talent in edifying young men went far
beyond his .
A talent I have therein , I must confess , nor am I very nice at
fit times to show it ; for your better instructions , therefore ,
you must never hereafter frequent taverns nor tap-houses , no masques
nor mummeries , no pastimes nor playhouses .
Must we have no recreation ?
Yes , on the days which profane lips call holydays , you may take
your spaniel and spend some hours at the ducking-pond .
What are we bound unto during the time we remain in the Family ?
During the light of the candle you are to be very attentive ; which
being extinguished , how to behave yourselves I will deliver in
private whisper .
' Tis now come to a whisper . What young Familists
be these ? I'faith , I 'll make one ; I 'll trip you , wife ; I scent
your footing , wife .
For Galen writes , Paracelsus can tell ,
Pothecaries have brains and noses eke to smell .
We shall with much diligence observe it .
I fear I shall have small cause to thank that
diligence ; but do your worst :
He that hath read five herbals in one year
Can find a trick which shall prevent this gear .
They are going ; follow , Purge , close , close and softly , like a
horsekeeper in a lady 's matted chamber at midnight .
Who knocks ?
Brethren and a Sister in the Family .
Enter in peace .
Brethren and a Sister ; that 's the word . How beastly was I mistaken
last day : I should have said " A Brother in the Family "
and I said " A Familiar Brother " ; for which I and my
family were thrust out of doors . But as Titus Silus of Holborn
Bridge most learnedly was wont to say , " Q.d . "
Who 's there ?
A Brother in the Family .
Enter , and welcome .
Thou sacred deity , Love !
Thou power predominate , more to be admir 'd
Than able to be express 'd , whose orb includes
All terrene joys which are , all states which be ,
Pay to thy sacred throne , as tribute-fee ,
Their thoughts and lives . Like Jove 's , so must thy acts
Endure no question ; why , thy hidden facts
The gods themselves obey ; heaven-synod holds
No gods but what thy awful power controls .
The Delphian archer proud with Python 's spoil ,
At Cupid 's hand was forc 'd to take the foil ;
Nor Mars his warlike adamantine targe
Could free his warlike breast at Cupid 's charge ;
And Jove , whose frown all mortal lives bereaves ,
His marble throne and ivory sceptre leaves ,
And in the likeness of a bull was seen ,
As forc 'd by him to bear the Tyrian queen
Through Neptune 's watery kingdom . If these submit ,
My metamorphose is not held unfit .
And see , in most wished occasion , Dryfat the merchant presents
himself . Sir , in the best of hours met ; my thoughts had marked
you out for a man most apt to do them the fairest of offices .
What ! Art thou a Welsh carrier or a northern landlord , th ' art
so saucy ?
ls't possible , sir , my disguise should so much fool your knowledge ?
How ? A northern landlord ? Can you think I get my living by
a bell and a clack-dish ?
By a bell and a clack-dish ? How 's that ?
Why , by begging , sir . Know you me now ?
Master Gerardine , disguised and ashore ! Nay , then I smell a rat .
Master Dryfat , shall I repose some trust in you ? Will you lay
by awhile your city 's precise humour ? Will you not deceive me ?
If I deceive your trust , the general plague seize me ; that is ,
may I die a cuckold .
And I say thou shall die a true citizen , if thou conceal it .
And thus in brief : it stands with thy knowledge how seriously
I have and do still affect Maria . Now , sir , I have so wrought
it , that if thou couldst procure me a fellow that could serve
instead of a crier , I myself would play Placket the paritor , and
summon Doctor Glister and Maria to appear at thy house ; and as
I play the paritor , so wouldst thou but assume the shape of
a proctor , I should have the wench , thou the credit , and the whole
city occasion of discourse this nine days .
How 's this , how 's this ? I should procure a fellow to play the
crier and I myself should play the proctor ? But upon what occasion
should they be summoned ?
Upon an accusation that Doctor Glister should get Maria his niece with child , and have bastards in the country , which I have a trick to make probable .
And now I recall it to memory , I heard somewhat to that effect
last night in Master Beardbush the barber 's shop ; but how will
this sort ? Who shall accuse him ?
Refer that to me , I say , be that my care ; all shall end in merriment ,
and no disgrace touch either of their reputations .
Then take both word and hand , 'tis done ; Club , Mistress Purge 's prentice , shall be the crier .
0 my most precious Dryfat , may none of thy daughters prove vessels
with foul bungholes , or none of thy sons hogsheads , but all true
and honourable Dryfats like thyself .
Well , Master Gerardine , I hope to see you a Familist before I
die .
That 's most likely , for I hold most of their principles already .
I never rail nor calumniate any man but in love and charity ;
I never cozen any man for any ill will I bear him , but in love
and charity to myself ; I never make my neighbour a cuckold for
any hate or malice I bear him , but in love and charity to his
wife .
And may those principles fructify in your weak members . I 'll
be gone , and with most quick dexterity provide you a crier . Tomorrow
at my house , said you , they should appear ?
Be that the time , most honoured Dryfat ; but be this known to none ,
most loved sir , save Club , or to some other whom your judgment
shall select as a fit person for our project .
Thus enough ; time out of sight .
Maria , thou art mine .
Earth 's perfection and nature 's glory :
Woman ; of what an excellency , if
Her thoughts and acts were squared and levelled
With the first celsitude of her creation !
T' enjoy a creature , whose dishevell 'd locks ,
Like gems against the repercussive sun ,
Gives light and splendour ; whose star-like eyes
Attract more gazers ' loves to see there a move
Then the Tartarians ' god , when Egeon 's hill
' A mounts in triumph ; a skin more pure and soft
Than is the silk-worm 's bed ; tooth more white
Than new-fall 'n snow or shining ivory ,
Is happiness sought by the gods themselves .
Celestial Venus , born without a mother ,
Be thou propitious ; thee do I implore ,
Not vulgar Venus , heaven 's scorn and Mars his whore .
Good aunt , quiet yourself ; ground not upon dreams , you know they
are ever contrary .
Minion , minion , coin no excuses ; I grant dreams are deceitful ,
but a true judgment grounded upon knowledge never fails . What ?
Have not I observed the rising and falling of the blood , the
coming and going of the countenance , your qualms , your unlacings ,
your longings ? Most evident tokens . Besides , a more certain
sign than all these , too ; you know't , I need not speak it ; nay ,
l am as skilful in that point as my husband . I can tell you ,
Aristotle speaks English enough to tell me these secrets . Body
of me , so narrowly looked to , and yet fly out ! Well , I see maids
will ha't in spite of laws or locks that restrain 'em ; they will
open , do men what they can .
I see my fault appears ; simplicity
Hath no evasion . ' Tis bootless to deny
Where guilty blood , cited by touch of shame ,
Runs through my veins , and leaves my conscience ' stain
Even in my face . Forbear , I do beseech you ,
To publish my defame ; what I have done
You shall not answer ; I must bear mine own .
Bear your own ? Ay , marry , there it goes ;
What must you bear ?
My sins , forsooth .
Your sins , forsooth ? Confess to me , and go not about the bush ;
you have been doing , that 's flat ; you have caught a clap , that 's
round ; and answer me roundly to the point , or else I 'll square .
Come , whose act is't ? I cannot devise unless it be my husband 's ,
for none else had access to thee ; I am sure time has turned his
bald side to thee , and I do but wonder how thou tookest opportunity .
Speak , tell me .
Now , good aunt , press me not ; let time reveal
What you suspect ; for never shall my tongue
Confess an act that tends unto my wrong .
Will you not bolt ? I must ha't out on you , and will .
By your leave , mistress--
Passion of my heart , what art thou ?
No ghost forsooth , though I appear in white .
No, but a saucy knave I perceive by your manners .
None of that livery neither . I am of the bearing trade forsooth ;
you may see by my smock-frock , I would say . I am , if it please
you , of the spick and span new-set-up company of porters . Here 's
my breastplate ; and besides our own arms we have the arms of the
city to help us in our burdens ; here 's the
cross and the sword of justice in good pewter , I can tell you ,
which goes as current with us as better metal .
What 's your name , sir ?
Nicholas Nebulo . There 's but a straw 's-breadth between that and
the arms ; 'tis in the backside of the cross here , and well known
in the city for an ancient name and an honest , an't like your
worship .
You are none of the twelve , are you ?
No forsooth , but one of the twenty-four--
Orders of knaves ; I thought so . Sirrah , you 're a rascal , to come
thus bluntly into my house with your dirty startups ; get you without
doors , like a filthy fellow as you are ; a place more fit for you .
0, good words , mistress . I may be warden of my company for aught
you know , and for my bluntness we have a clause in our charter
to warrant that ; for as we bear , so likewise we may be borne with ,
and have free egress and regress where our business lies .
And what 's your business here ?
I have a letter , an't please you , to Master Doctor .
From whence ?
That I cannot show your worship ; but I had it of Curtal the carrier ,
whose lawful deputy I am .
Leave your scraping , sirrah . Fie , how rank the knave smells of
grease and taps-droppings .
What , are you rheumatic too , with a vengeance !
Yes indeed , mistress ; though I be but a poor man , I have a spice
of the gentleman in me ; Master Doctor could smell it quickly ,
because he 's a gentleman himself . I must to the diet , and that
is tobacco at the ale-house ; I use n'other physic for it .
Did ever such a peasant defile my floor , or breathe so near me ?
I'faith , sirrah , you would be bummed for your roguery , if you
were well served .
I am bummed well enough already , mistress ; look here else . Sir-reverence in your worship , Master Doctor 's lips are not made
of better stuff .
What an impudent rogue is this . Sirrah , be gone I say ; I would
be rid o ' you .
Be rid o ' me ? I shall gallop then . You mistake me , forsooth ;
I am a foot post , I do not use to ride .
I think the rascal be humorous or drunk . Well , I will read the
letter and send him packing , or else he will spew or do worse
before me . Fie on him , I think he will infect me with some filthy
disease .
Or else I lose mine aim .
What 's here ? " Your
poor nurse , Thomasine Tweedles ? " For my life , now shall
I find out my husband 's knavery I have so long suspected .
She begins to nibble ; 'twill take , i'faith.--Mistress ,
I see some discontentment in your looks ;
Care ill befits so delicate a spirit .
Be frolic , wench , for he that is so near thee
Has been much nearer .
That accent sounds sweet music ; 'tis my love .
That tongue breathes life into my lifeless spirits :
Gerardine ? 0 rapture ! Why thus disguis 'd ?
No more , be mute . Thus must I vary forms
To bring our cares to end ; her jealousy
Ensues this drift , which , if it take true scope ,
Love 's joy comes next ; be fearless in that hope .
' Tis so . Rats-bane ! I ha't ; it racks on , it torments me ! Here
'tis : " Woe worth the time that ever I gave suck to a child
that came in at the window , God knows how . " Villainous lecher !
" Yet if you did but see how like the little red-headed knave
is to his father . " Damnable doctor ! A bastard in the country ,
and another towards here . I am out of doubt this is his work .
You are an arrant strumpet ! Incest , fornication ,
abomination in my own house ! Intolerable ! 0, for long nails
to scratch out his eyes !
Or the breeches , to fight with him .
Out of my sight , quean ; thou shalt to Bridewell ! 0, I shall be
mad with rage !
Then you shall go to Bedlam .
Hence , you slave .
I must have a penny ; you must pay me for my pains .
The devil pay thee .
0, that 's the doctor ; but he wants his horns .
But I 'll furnish him ere long , if I live .
It works as I would wish . Farewell Maria ;
This storm once past , fair weather ever after .
Was ever woman so moved ? But you shall be talked withal ; and
for mine old fornicator , he shall ha't as hot as coals , i'faith .
Here 's stuff indeed ! Come , minx , come ; there 's law for you both .
Have I found your knavery ? If I wink at this , let me be stone
blind , or stoned to death ; bear this , and bear all !
Our hopes are cross 'd ; sure there 's some providence
Which countermands libidinous appetites ,
For what we most intend is counter-check 'd
By strange and unexpected accidents .
For by disguise procuring full access ,
Nay , ready to have seiz 'd th ' expected prize ,
The candle out , steps 'twix my hopes and me
Some pleasant groin , possess 'd and full enjoy 'd
That sweet for which our vigilant eyes have watch 'd ,
And in one moment frustrates all our hopes .
Upon my life , we are bewitched : the greasy rascal that first seized
Mistress Purge , by the last reflection of the light , appeared
to my sight not much unlike her husband .
The court 's gall , the city 's plague , and Europa 's sea-form be
his perpetual crest , whate 'er 'a was . To lose Mistress Purge
for lack of dexterity , is a disgrace insalveable . The like opportunity
will never present itself .
' Twas an egregious grief , I must confess , to see a knave slip
betwixt us both and take occasion by the foretop ; but since these
projects have had so star-cross events , let 's lay some plot how
to revenge our late disgrace on the doctor by making him cuckold .
Agreed ; but what melancholy sir with acrostic arms now comes from
the Family ?
Purge the pothecary ; I prithee , let 's step aside and hear the
issue of this discontent .
0, the misery of married men 's estate !
' A begins very pitifully .
0 women , what are many of you ?
Why , disease to bachelors , and plagues to married
men .
0 marriage , the rage of all our miseries ! My wife is a dissembling
strumpet .
So is many a man 's besides yours ; and what of
that ?
I would have a law that all such which pray little should instantly
be married ; for then would they pray continually , if it were but
to be rid of their wives .
This is a charitable request and surely would
pass the Lower House .
Surely if affliction can bring a man to heaven , I cannot see how
any married man can be damned ; I have made myself a plain cuckold .
GUDGEON
A pile on ye , want you ? Had you not been so manable ,
here are some would have saved you that labour .
What shall I do in this extremity ? Had I but witness of the fact ,
I would make her answer it before authority . This is my wedding
ring ; 'tis it , I know it by the posy . This I took from her finger
in the dark , and she was therewith very well pleased ; were not
this , trow , a sufficient testimony ? She knows not that it was
myself got so near her ; I will take counsel . Well , little know
bachelors the miseries they undergo when they prostrate themselves
to women .
0 most true , Master Purge :
little knows a man what elements 'a is to pass , when 'a puts his
head under a woman 's girdle . Your passion , Master Purge , is overheard ,
and , plain tale to tell , we were eye-witnesses of your wife 's
treachery , and if need be will be ready to depose as much .
What , Master Lipsalve and Master Gudgeon , are you disguised testimonies ?
Nay then , revenge look big ! Elf and fairy
Help to revenge the wronged pothecary !
Why , now 'a speaks like himself ; get me a paritor for her straight .
Conceal the ring , my little Purge ; let not thy wife know thou
hast it , until she comes to her trial .
Your advices are very pithy ; therefore in private let me disclose
my intent .
Off , boys .
SHRIMP
What dost thou think of thy master ? Is 'a not a rare gull ?
I think 'a will swallow and pocket more disgraces than large-conscienced lawyer fees in a Michaelmas term . Thy master ,
my honest Shrimp , comes not much short of a fool too , but that
'a is a courtier .
Draw somewhat near , and overhear their conference .
This shape of the crier must Club tomorrow assume . Are you fitted
for Poppin the proctor ?
Excellent , and have spent some study in the mystical cases of
venery . I can describe how often a man may lie with another man 's
wife before 'a come to the white sheet--
How long is that ?
Why , till 'a be taken tardy;--how long all women-kind may by the
statute profess and swear they are maids .
And how long is that ?
Why , till their bellies be so big , that it cannot be no longer
concealed ; but come forward towards Glister 's .
It must be so . Let the summer tickle her ; you shall bring in
these allegations and let us alone to swear them . Who 's this ?
Master Dryfat ? Opportunely met , sir ; and whether so fast ? The
news , the news ?
Faith , gentlemen , I think to relate for news what I hear of Doctor
Glister would come stale to your hearings .
0, the getting of his niece with child ; tut , that 's apparently
known to all the company . But , in the name of Jupiter , what art
thou ? Or from whence camest thou ?
Why , sir , I come from compassing the corners of the land .
Of what trade , in the name of Pluto ?
Of the devil 's trade ; for I live as he does , by the sins of the
people . In brief , sir , I am Placket the paritor .
As the devil would ! We have , my noble paritor , instant employment
for thee ; a grey groat is to be purchased without sneaking , my
little sumner ; where 's thy my honest Placket ?
Sir , according to the old ballad ,
" My ready , have I ,
With my pen and inkhorn hanging by . "
Her name , sir , her name ?
Is't no more but so ?
I have most right to her name . Her name , Master Placket , is my
wife , Mistress Purge , sir . To what place dost thou belong ?
To the commissioners which sit tomorrow at Master Dryfat 's upon
the crimes of Doctor Glister and others .
Sits there a commission , Dryfat ? Now for the love of lechery ,
let 's have Mistress Purge summoned thither .
She makes my reasonable full . My grant ,
sir , and she shall appear there upon a crime of concupiscence :
is not that your meaning ?
Yes , my honest paritor ; here 's thy fee .
And see how happily it succeeds : Mistress Purge is new come from
the Family . Let us step aside whilst Placket the paritor gives
her a summons .
Content . To her , Placket , but see for the bribery of twelvepence
you strike her not out of your
Fear not , sir .
Forward apace , Club .
Your name I take to be Mistress Purge , fair gentlewoman ?
I am Mistress Purge , Purge 's wife the pothecary ; what of that ?
nomina .
I cite you by virtue of my to make your personal
appearance by eight of the clock in the morrow morning , before
certain commissioners at Master Dryfat 's house , to answer to an
accusation of a crime of concupiscence .
To answer a crime of concupiscence ? What 's that , I pray ?
Why , 'tis to answer a venereal crime , for having carnal copulation
with other besides your husband .
What are you , I pray ?
By name Placket , by trade a paritor .
And must I answer , say you , to a venereal crime ? I tell thee ,
Placket the paritor , I am able to answer thee or any man else
in any venereal crime they 'll put me to ; and so tell your commissioners .
If you fail your appearance , the penalty must fall heavy .
If it fall never so heavy , I am able to bear it ; and so set forward ,
Club .
Excellent , i'faith . After your wife , Purge . Read , Placket , thy
my noble groat-monger .
Silence . The first that marcheth in this fair rank is Thrum
the feltmaker , for getting his maid with child and sending his
prentice to Bridewell for the fact ; Whip the beadle , for letting
a punk escape for a night 's lodging and bribe of ten groats ; Bat
the bellman , for lying with a wench in a tailor 's stall at midnight ,
when 'a should be performing his office .
And Tipple the tapster , for deflowering a virgin in his cellar ;
Doctor Glister , his wife , Maria , Mistress Purge . These be the
complete number .
Now dissolve , and each to his occasion till tomorrow morning .
This was your colour to keep her close , but what cloak ha' you
for her 's and your own shame ? What , your own niece , your brother 's
daughter , besides your bastard in the country !
Wife , range not too far , I would advise you ! Come home in time ;
vex me not beyond sufferance . The two-edged sword of thy tongue
hath drawn blood o ' me . Patience , I say ; thou art all this while
in an error .
No, thou hast been all this while in an urinal ; thou hast gone
out of thy compass in women 's waters ; you 're a conjuror , forsooth ,
and can rouse your spirits into circles . Ah , you old fornicator ,
that ever I saw that red beard of thine ! Now could I rail against
thy complexion . I think , in my conscience , the traces and caparison
of Venus ' coach are made o ' red hairs , which may be a true emblem
that no flaxen stuff or tanned white leather draws love like 'em ;
I think thou manuredest thy chin with the droppings of eggs and
muskadine before it bristled . A shame take thee and thy loadstone .
But 'tis no matter ; Master Placket the paritor has cited you ,
and you shall answer it .
0, the raging jealousy of a woman ! Do you hear , wife ? I will
show myself a man of sense , and answer you with silence ; or like
a man of wisdom , speak in brief . I say you are a scold , and beware
the cucking-stool .
I say you are a ninnihammer , and beware the cuckoo : for as sure
as I have ware , I 'll traffic with the next merchant venturer ;
and in good time here comes gallants of the right trade .
All alone , Mistress Glister ? Meditating who shall be your next
child 's father ?
Indeed , methinks that should be one end of her thought , an't be
but to cry quittance with her husband , of whose abuse the town
rings .
Flax and fire , flax and fire ; here are fellows
come in the nick , to light their matches at my tinder .
He tells you true , Mistress Glister ; the doctor hath made you
ordinary in our ordinaries ; satires whet their tooths , and steep
rods in piss ; epigrams lie in poetry 's pickle , and we shall have
rhyme out of all reason against you .
Ere long he will take up his station at a stationer 's , where we
shall see him do penance in a sheet at least .
0, I am nettled ! My patience is so provoked that I must doff
my modesty . What shall I do ? If ye be honest gentlemen , counsel
me in my revenge , teach me what to do , make my case your own .
Why , you are in the common road of revenge , take which hand you
will , you cannot go out o ' your way ; 'tis as soon taken as time
by his forepart .
Faith , since he has strook with the sword , strike you with the
scabbard ; in plain terms , cuckold him . You may as easily do 't
as lie down o ' your bed .
This gear cottons , i'faith .
I apprehend you , gentlemen . Lord , how much better are two heads
than one to make one large head !
You say true , Mistress Glister : there 's help required in grafting ; and how happily we come to tender our service . Let our pretence
be to take physic of the doctor ; and that he may with as much
ease minister to us as we to you , we 'll take a lodging in his
house .
How say you to this ? Is the colour good ? Does't like you ?
Passing well ; the colour is so good , that you shall wear my favour
out o ' the same piece .
Excellent , excellent ; now shall we be revenged for the whipping .
Mistress Glister , let me be your first man .
Nay , soft , sir , I plied her as soon as you .
I should have an oar in her boat too by right .
How ill-advised were you to marry one with a red beard !
0 Master Lipsalve , I am not the first that has fallen under that
ensign . There 's no complexion more attractive in this time for
women than gold and red beards : such men are all liver .
Ay , but small heart , and less honesty .
Yes , they are honest too in some kind , for they 'll beg before
they 'll steal .
That 's true ; for , for one that holds up his hand at the sessions ,
you shall have ten come into the bawdy court .
Was ever beard so back-bitten ? This were enough
to make red beards turn medley , and dash 'em clean out of countenance ;
but I hope , like mine , they fear no colours . And you were ten
courtiers , I 'll front you ; I must give you physic , with a pox .
welcome ; I am very glad to see you well .
0 Master Doctor , your salutation is very suspicious !
Why , Master Lipsalve ?
It can scarce be hearty , for physicians are rather glad to see
men ill than well .
Not so , sir ; you must distinguish of men ; though this I know ,
virtue is not the end of all science , which commonly keeps the
professor poor ; some study questuary and gainful arts , and every
one would thrive in 's calling . But , i'faith , gentlemen , what
wind drives you hither ?
The wind-colic , Master Doctor , or some such disease .
But not the stone-colic ?
0 no , sir , we have no obstructions in those parts ; we are loose
enough there .
If you were troubled with that , my wife can tell you of an excellent
remedy .
We need it not , we need it not . But indeed , Master Doctor , for
some private infirmities , which our waters shall make known to
you , we desire to take some physic of you for a few days ; and
to that end we would take a lodging in your house during the time .
Shall we entreat your favour ?
No entreaty , gentlemen ; you shall command me to search the very
profundity of my skill for you . Have them in , wife , and show
them their lodging . I will think upon another receipt , and follow
you immediately .
And i'faith we shall requite your pains to the full .
To the fool , you mean . I know you ha' the horn of plenty for
me , which you would derive unto me from the liberality of your
bawdies , not your minds . Here are lords that , having learned
the O P Q of courtship , travel up and down among citizens ' wives
to show their learning and bringing up ; as if the city were not
already a good proficient in the court horn-book . Yes , I warrant
they have heads as capable as other men ; ay , and some of them
can wisely say with the philosopher , that in knowing all they
know nothing . Well , because I am of the livery , and pay scot
and lot amongst you , do but observe how I 'll fetch over my gallants
for your sakes . They say I am of the right hair ; and indeed they
may stand to't , and hold the position good , saving with my wife .
I know they are hot-spurs , and I must have an eye to the main .
They have been whipped already for lechery and yet the pride
of the flesh pricks 'em .
Well , I must in ; I have given them such a pill
Shall take 'em down , for lust must have his fill .
Now nature 's pencil and the hand of time
Gives life and limb to generation 's act ,
My shame and guilt in wordless notes appear ,
The argument of scorn . 0 now I stand
The theme and comment to each liberal tongue ,
Whilst hope breeds comfort , and fear threats my wrong .
0 Gerardine , how oft thy lively figure ,
Deeply impressed in my yielding temper ,
Assures me thou art mine ! How fancy paints
Thy true proportion in my troubled sleep ,
Because sole subject of my daily thoughts .
O , if thy vows prove feign 'd and thou unjust ,
I say and swear in men there is no trust .
Thus have I passed the round and court of guard ,
Without the word : either conceit is strong ,
Or else the body where true love 's confin 'd
Walks as a spirit and doth force his way
Through greatest dangers , frightful to those eyes
That wait to intercept him . Maria !
How like to Cynthia in her silver orb
She seems to me , attended by love 's lamp ,
Whose mutual influence and soul 's sympathy
Doth show heaven 's model in mortality .
Gerardine !
Aurora nor the blushing sun 's approach
Dart not more comfort to this universe
Than thou to me . Most acceptably come ;
The art of number cannot count the hours
Thou hast been absent .
Infinity of love
Holds no proportion with arithmetic .
Think not , Maria , but my heart retains
A deep impression of such thoughts as these .
I have been forging of a mirthful plot
To celebrate our wish 'd conjunction ;
Which now digested , come to summon thee
To be an actress in the comedy .
How , where , when ? Speak , mine ears are quick to hear ;
I stand on thorns already to be there .
At Dryfat 's house , the merchant , there 's our scene ,
Whose sequel , if I fail not in intent ,
Shall answer our desires and each content .
But when sawest thou Lipsalve and Gudgeon , our two gallants ?
MARIA
They are here in the house , so handled by mine uncle that they
are the pitifullest patients that ever you beheld .
No matter , he serves them in their kind ; they were infamous in
the court and now are grown as notorious in the city . They may
happily prove particles in our sport , and fit subjects for laughter .
Time calls me hence : adieu ; prepare to meet .
I shall outstrip the nimblest in my feet .
Come Club , come , there 's a merry fray towards ; we shall see the
death of melancholy ; wherein thou and I must call a grand jury
of jests together , and pass upon them with the club law .
Now as I am 0 the crier , and yet but a young club , I have not
yet practised that law ; you have a whole dryfat on't ; I pray you
instruct me .
Why , 'tis a law enacted , by the common council of statute-caps ,
to qualify the rage of the time , to follow , to call back , and
sometimes to encounter gentlemen when they run in arrearages ;
I tell thee there 's no averment against our book-cases . ' Tis
the law called make-peace ; it makes them even when they are at
odds ; it shows 'em a flat case as plain as a pack-staff , that
is , knocks 'em down without circumstance .
Ay , marry , I like that law well ; 'tis studied with the turning
of a hand . There 's no quiddits nor pedlar 's French in't ; there
needs no book for th ' exposition o ' th ' terms ; 'tis as easily
learned as the felling of wood and getting of children ; all is
but laying on load the downright blow .
Ay , and by the way of exhortation it prints this moral sentence
on their costards , in capital letters , " Agree , for the law
is costly " .
Good , good . But all this while there 's no doctor thought on ;
we must have one to arbitrate .
Why , Master Gerardine , man , has his name for the purpose ; he shall
be called Doctor Stickler ; here he
comes .
How now , lads , does our conceit cotton ? Ha' you summoned your
wits from wool-gathering ? Are you fraught with matter for this
merriment ?
Full , full ; we are in labour , man , and we shall die without midwifery .
We are ravished with delight , like the wench that was got with
child against her stomach . 0, but if we could wrest this smock
law now in hand to our club law , it were excellent .
Easily , easily ; all shall be called the club law .
As how ?
Why , thus . Club is the crier , I am Poppin the proctor and you
Stickler the doctor ; he calls them to appear , I must be of their
counsel and you must attone them , put 'em together . We may know
their cases and be in their elements , mark you me , but they cannot
be in ours . Tut , none knows our secrets ; we can speak fustian
above their understanding , and make asses ' ears attentive . I 'll
play Ambodexter , tell 'em 'tis a plain case and put 'em down with
the club law ; so that , as Club said well e 'en now , our knavery
is as near allied as felling of wood and getting of children .
Excellent , excellent . By this they are at hand : let 's bear these
things like ourselves ; I 'll withdraw and put on my habiliments ,
and then enter for the doctor .
Do so ; they come , they come !
Welcome , Master Doctor Glister and Master Purge ; there 's a commission
to be sat upon this day , to open a passage for imprisoned truth ,
concerning acts yet
True ; I am brought hither by the malice of my wife .
And I have a just appeal against my wife .
Master Poppin , so I think you are called , I understand you have
the law at your fingers ' ends .
I can box cases , and scold and scratch it out amongst them .
Indeed , fame reports you to be a good trumpeter of causes ; I must
retain you , sir , to sound mine .
My sackbut shall do it most pathetically ; tell me , in brief , the
nature of your case .
Faith , sir , a scandalous letter devised to wrong my reputation ,
about a bastard in the country which should be mine .
About a bastard in the country which should be yours ? Hum ; 'tis
very like you then , it should seem .
0 no , sir , understand me , only fathered upon me .
Only fathered upon you I understand
you , and like you well too , you do not flatter yourself in your
own case , no , 'tis not good ; well , what more ?
And about my niece , got with child in my own house .
Byrlady , burdens of some weight , which you make light of ! You
deny ?
What else , sir ? I have reason .
I know it well , I take you for no beast . Believe me , Master Doctor ,
denial and reason are two main grounds ; stand upon them , and you
cannot err . Your case , Master Purge ?
First take your fee , Master Poppin , that you may have the more
feeling , and urge it home when you come to't . Mine is a discovery
of my wife 's iniquity at the Family of Love .
Otherwise called the House of Venery , where they hunger and thirst
for't .
True , sir ; you have heard of the Hole in the Wall , where they
assemble together in the day-time , like so many bees under a hive ?
Come home and lodge among hornets , is't
not so ?
I cannot tell , sir ; but for my part , I am much noted as I go .
No doubt of that , sir ; your wife can furnish you with notes out
of her cotations .
Ay , and give him a two-tagged point to tie 'em together .
But how came you to detect her ?
Why , thus , sir : getting the word , I dogged her to the Family where ,
closing with her , I whispered so pleasing a tale in her ear that
I got from her her wedding ring ; and here 'tis .
Well , out of that ring we will wring matter that shall carry meat
i' th ' mouth . But what witness or proof can you produce to make
good your wife 's iniquity and your own cuckoldry ?
Master Lipsalve and Master Gudgeon , who were her companions at
that same time .
Very good ; are they cited in the
They will be here , sir .
If they be , they will bewray all .
So much the better ; 'twill savour well for Master Purge .
You understand my case now ?
And mine too , sir ?
I do , I do ; they are as different as a doctor and a dunce , a man
and a beast . Here 's the compendium ; yours , Master Doctor , stands
upon the negative ; and yours , Master Purge , upon the affirmative ;
I ha't , I ha't .
Mine is very current , sir ; I can show you good guilt .
Ay , marry , there spoke an angel ; gilt 's current indeed ; let me
feel 't , let me feel 't .
I mean , my wife 's guilt .
Master Poppin , you shall have innocence to speak for me .
Tut , innocence is a fool , I care not for 's company ; I can speak
enough without him .
Then , I hope , you will be as good to us as the five-finger at
maw .
No, rather as Hercules , to lip-labour 'em with the club law ; tut ,
let me alone .
0, you are here , sir ? I have brought you a full barn to glut
your greedy appetite ; if you have any maw , feed here till you
choke again . Now shall I see the whole carcass of your knavery
ripped up ; if thou hast any grace , now will thy red beard turn
white upon't .
0, how have I been toss 'd from post to pillar
In this libidinous world . The yoke I bear
Is so uneven , as if an innocent lamb
And a mad hare-brain 'd ox should draw together .
But I must have patience , there 's no remedy .
There 's some difference between these two tempers .
I would give a hundred pounds my wife had so gentle a spirit .
My wife must needs be gentle , for she can bear double .
Here comes Master Doctor ; now rig up your vessels , every one to
his tackling .
Good day to all at once , and peace amongst you . Fie , how I sweat ;
I think Vulcan ne 'er toiled so at his anvil as I have done , and
all to make maid 's water to slake Cupid 's fire , and to turn his
shafts from the feather-bed to the bed-post , from the heart to
the heel . Come , Master Poppin , shall we to this gear ?
Reverend doctor , we have stayed your coming . Crier , cry silence !
Master Doctor , I have heard in general terms the tales of Master
Doctor Glister and Master Purge , which have in mutual manner jumped
into the quagmire of my mind ; out of which quagmire , by your enforcement
and mine own duty , I pluck them up by the ears , and thus , in naked
apparance , I present them .
Master Poppin . Leave your allegories ,
your metaphors and circumlocutions , and to the point .
Then briefly thus : I have compared their tales , how short they
will come of their wives ' I know not ; and first for Mistress Purge .
Crier , call Mistress Purge .
Rebecca Purge , wife to Peter Purge , pothecary , appear upon thy
purgation , upon pain of excommunication .
Here I am . 0 time 's impiety !
Hither I come from out the harmless fold
To have my good name eaten up by wolves .
See how they grin ! Well , the weak must to the wall ;
I must bear wrong , but shame shall them befall .
Who is her accuser ?
Her own husband , upon the late discovery of a crew of ruffed , strait-laced , yet loose-bodied dames , with a
rout of omnium-gatherums , assembled by the title of the Family
of Love ; which , Master Doctor , if they be not punished and suppressed
by our club law , each man 's copyhold will become freehold , specialities
will turn to generalities , and so from unity to parity , from parity
to plurality , and from plurality to universality ; their wives ,
the only ornaments of their houses , and of all their wares , goods ,
and chattels , the chief moveables , will be made common .
Most voluble and eloquent proctor !
Byrlady , these enormities must and shall be redressed , otherwise
I see their charter will be infringed , and their ancient staff
of government the club ( from whence we derive our law of castigation ) ,
this club , I say , they seeming nothing less than men by their
fore-part , will be turned upon their own heads . Speak , Rebecca
Purge : art thou one of this Family ? Hast thou ever known the
body of any man there or elsewhere concupiscentically ?
No, Master Doctor , those are but devices of the wicked to trap
the innocent ; but I thank my spirit I have fear before my eyes ,
which my husband sees not , because something hangs in 's light .
That 's my horns . She flouts me to my face , and
I will not endure it . I shall carry her mark to my grave.--Master
Doctor , she has given me that , that Aesculapius , were he now extant ,
could not heal , nor take away .
Produce your witness , Master Purge , and blow not your own horn .
Master Lipsalve and Master Gudgeon , let them be called .
Laurence Lipsalve and Gregory Gudgeon , late of
in the county of gentlemen , come into the court
and give your evidence , upon pain of that which shall ensue .
Here they come , in pain I warrant them . How works your physic ,
gallants ? Do you go well to the ground ? Now cuckold the doctor !
Wife , who 's your first man now ? Now strike with the scabbard !
Ha , ha , ha !
A villainous doctor .
Mountebank , you 're a rascal , and we will cast about to be revenged .
Cast about this way and bewray what you can concerning Mistress
Purge , who stands here upon her purgation , either to prove mundified
or contaminated , according to the tenor-piece of your principal
evidence . First give 'em the book .
Come , lay your hands upon the book . You shall speak and aver
no more , nor wade no farther into the cream-pots of this woman 's
crime , than the naked truth and the cart-rope of your conscience
shall conduct you , so help you the contents . Kiss the book .
Alas , we are not in case to answer largely ; but if you will have
our evidence in brief , I think I kissed her at the Family some
three times , once at coming , once at going , and once in the midst ;
otherwise never knew her dishonestly .
Ay , mark that middle kiss , Master Doctor .
And for my part , I have been more mortified by her than ever I
was provoked .
How say you to this , Master Purge ? Your witness is weak , and ,
sir-reverence on it , without sounder proof , they may depart
to the close-stool whence they came , and you to your pothecary 's
shop .
No, Master Doctor , I have another bolt to shoot that shall strike
her dead ; she shall not have a word to say .
Answer me to this , Mistress Purge ; where 's your wedding ring ?
My wedding ring ? Why , what should I do with unnecessary things
about me , when the poor begs at my gate ready to starve ? Is it
not better , as I learned last lecture , to send my substance before
me , where I may find it , than to leave it behind me , where I must
forego it ? Yes , verily ; wherefore , to put you out of doubt , I
have given that ring to charitable uses .
Nay , now she falters . My client can shew that ring , got from
her at the Family , when these two courtlings had at the same
time beleaguered her fort .
This alters the case clean . What starting-hole ha' you now , Mistress
Purge ?
E'en the sanctuary of a safe conscience . Now truly , truly , however
he came by that ring , by my Sisterhood , I gave it to the relief
of the distressed Geneva .
How ! To the relief of the distressed Geneva ? Justice , Master
Doctor ! I may now decline one word
more shall overthrow her . I myself was a Familist that day , who ,
more jealous than zealous in devotion , thrust in amongst the rest
( as I had most right ) on purpose to sound her , to find out the
knavery . Short tale to make , I got her ring , and here it is :
Husband , I see you are hoodwinked in the right use of feeling
and knowledge , as if I knew you not then as well as the child
knows his own father ! Look in the posy of my ring : does it not
tell you that we two are one flesh ? And hath not fellow-feeling
taught us to know one another as well by night as by day ? Husband ,
husband , will you do as the blind jade , break your neck down a
hill because you see it not ? Ha' you no light of nature in that
flesh of yours ? Now , as true as I live , Master Doctor , I had
a secret operation , and I knew him then to be my husband e 'en
by very instinct .
Impudence , dost not blush ? Art not ashamed to lie so abominable ?
No, husband , rather be you ashamed of your own weakness ; for ,
for my part , I neither fear nor shame what man can do unto me .
Master Purge , I see you have spent your pith ; therefore best make
a full point at the ring , and attend our pleasure . Master Poppin ,
proceed to the rest .
Crier , call Doctor Glister .
Doctor Glister , alias suppositor doctor of physic , appear upon
thy purgation , upon the belly-pain that may ensue therein .
Here , Master Doctor .
Who is his accuser ?
His clamorous wife , who seems to enforce a separation about a
bastard in the country , which should be his , only fathered upon
him .
What proof of that ?
Proof unanswerable , Master Doctor , the nurse 's letter : let it
be read ; but first observe his countenance : it may be his blushing
will bewray his guilt .
Now by this light , I thought it had indeed , but I see 'tis but
the reflection of his beard . Read the letter , Master Poppin .
DRYFAT
" After my hearty commendations remembered
unto your worshipful doctorship , trusting in God that you are
as well as I was at the making hereof , thanks be to him therefor .
The cause of my writing unto you at this time is to let you understand
that your little son is turned a ragged colt , a very stripling ;
for , being now stripped of all his clothing , his backside wants
a tail-piece , commends itself to your fatherly consideration .
Woe worth the time that ever I gave suck to a child that came
in at the window , God knows how . Yet if you did but see how like
the pert , little , red-headed knave is to his father , and how like
a sparrow he mouses and touses my little Bess already , you
would take him for your own , and pay me my hire . I write not
of the want of one thing , for I want all things ; wherefore take
some speedy order , or else as naked as he came from the mother
will I send him to the father . From Pis . the xxii of --
Your poor nurse , Thomasine Tweedles . "
Master Doctor , truth needs not the foil of rhetoric ; I will only
in answer for myself , as sometimes a wise man
did : such and such things are laid to my charge , which I deny ;
you may think of me what you please , but I am as innocent in this
as the child new-born .
Why , there 's partly a confession . The child we know is innocent ,
and not new-born neither , for it should seem by the letter he
is able to call his dad knave .
You take me wrong , Master Doctor .
Under correction , thus much can I say for my client 's justification :
indeed he hath travelled well in the beating of pulses , and hath
been much conversant in women 's jordans ; but he had ever a care
to raise his patient being before cast down . His charitable disposition
hath been such to poor folk , that he never took above fourpence
for the casting of a water , which good custom was so well known
among all his patients , that if sixpence were at any time offered
him , they might be bold to ask and have twopence again . He hath
been so skilful and painful withal in the cure of the green sickness ,
that , of my knowledge , he hath risen at all hours in the night
to pleasure maids that have had it . And for that foul-mouthed disease , termed by a fine phrase--a pox on't , what
d'ye call 't ? 0, the grincomes--at that he hath played his doctor 's
prize , and writes to all mountebanks ; so that
the wise woman in Pissing Alley , nor she in Do-little Lane , are
more famous for good deeds than he . Then , Master Doctor , out
of these presumptions , besides his flat denial ( a more infallible
ground ) , you may gather his innocence , and let him have his purgation .
No, Master Poppin , it is not so to be foisted off .
Nay , Master Doctor , what say you to his own niece , that looks
big upon him ? An arrow that sticks for the upshot against all
comers ; which by his restraint of her from Master Gerardine , an
honest gentleman that loved her , and upon that colour from the
sight and intercourse of other men , must by all presumptions be
his own act .
0 monstrous ! This is a foul blot in your tables indeed .
Wife , thou hast no shame nor womanhood in thee ; thy conscience
knows me .
True of thy flesh , who knows not that ? Thy beard speaks for thee .
Ay , ay , thou liest by me like a stone , but abroad th'art like
a stone-horse , you old limb-lifter !
Cease your clamour , and attend my speech . Most worshipful , reverend
and judicial doctor , for the quickening of your memory I will
give you a breviat of all that hath been spoken . Master Doctor
Glister hath a cradleful and a bellyful , you see , thrust upon
him ; and Master Purge a headful . Your wife is an angry honeyless
wasp , whose sting I hope you need not fear , and yours carries
honey in her mouth , but her sting makes your forehead swell .
Your wife makes you deaf with the shrill treble of her tongue ;
and yours makes you horn-mad with the tenor of her tale . In fine ,
Master Doctor 's refuge is his conscience , and Master Purge runs
at his wife 's ring .
a good audit ha' you made , Master Poppin .
Now attend my arbitrement . For you gallants , though you have
incurred the danger of the law by using counterfeit keys , and
putting your hands into the wrong pocket , yet because I see you
punished and purged already , my advice is , that you learn the
A B C of better manners . Go back and tell how you have been used
in the city ; and being thus scoured , keep yourselves clean and
the bed undefiled . For you , Master Purge , because I see your
evidence insufficient , and indeed too weak , to foil your wife 's
uprightness , and seeing jealousy and unkindness hath only made
her a stranger in your land of Ham , my counsel is that you readvance
your standard , give her new press-money .
You may enjoin me , sir , but--
But not at me , man ; I will enjoin you , and conjoin you , and briefly
thus : you have your ring that has made this combustion and uproar ;
that keep still : wear it ; and here , by my edict , be it proclaimed
to all that are jealous , to wear their wives ' ring still on their
fingers , as best for their security , and the only charm against
cuckoldry .
Then , wife , at Master Doctor 's enjoinment , so thou wilt promise
me to come no more at the Family , I receive thee into the lists
of my favour .
Truly husband , my love must be free still to God 's creatures ;
yea , nevertheless preserving you still as the head of my body ,
I will do as the spirit shall enable me .
Go to ; thou hast a good wife , and there an end . Upon you , Master
Doctor , being solicited by so apparent proof , I can do no less
than pronounce a severe sentence . And yet , i'faith , the reverence
of your calling and profession doth somewhat check my austerity ;
what if Master Gerardine , by my persuasion , would yet be induced
to take your niece , and father the child ? Would you launch with
a thousand pound , besides her father 's portion ?
Master Doctor , I would , were it but to redeem her lost good name .
Then , foreknowing what would happen , I thought good , in Master
Gerardine 's name , to have this bond ready , which if you seal to ,
he shall take her with all faults .
That will I instantly . So , this is done ;
which together with my niece do I deliver by these presents to
the use of Master Gerardine .
He thanks you heartily , and lets you know ,
That Indian mines and Tagus ' glistering ore
To this bequest were unto me but poor .
What ? Gerardine , Dryfat and Club !
DRYFAT AND CLUB
The very same . You are welcome to our club law !
Cease admiration here . What doubt remains
I 'll satisfy at full . Now join with me
For approbation of our Family .


Gentles , whose favour have o 'erspread this place ,
And shed the real influence of grace
On harmless mirth , we thank you ; for our hope
Attracts such vigour and unmeasur 'd scope
From the reflecting splendour of your eyes ,
That , grace presum 'd , fear in oblivion dies .
Your judgment , as it is the touch and trier
Of good from bad , so from your hearts comes fire ,
That gives both ardour to the wit refin 'd ,
And sweetens th ' incense of each willing mind .
0 may that fire ne 'er die ; nor let your favours
Depart from us : give countenance to their labours
Propos 'd a sacrifice , which may no less
Their strong desires than our true zeals express .
