' My father is deceased . Come Gaveston ,
And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend . '
Ah , words that make me surfeit with delight !
What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston
Than live and be the favourite of a King !
Sweet prince , I come ! These , these thy amorous lines
Might have enforced me to have swum from France ,
And , like Leander , gasped upon the sand ,
So thou wouldst smile , and take me in thine arms .
The sight of London to my exiled eyes
Is as Elysium to a newcome soul :
Not that I love the city or the men ,
But that it harbours him I hold so dear ,
The King , upon whose bosom let me die ,
And with the world be still at enmity .
What need the arctic people love starlight ,
To whom the sun shines both by day and night ?
Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers ,
My knee shall bow to none but to the King .
As for the multitude , that are but sparks ,
Raked up in embers of their poverty ,
That glanceth at my lips , and flieth away .
But how now , what are these ?
Such as desire your worship 's service .
What canst thou do ?
FIRST POOR MAN. I can ride .
But I have no horses . What art thou ?
SECOND POOR MAN. A traveller .
Let me see ; thou wouldst do well
To wait at my trencher , and tell me lies at dinner-
time ; and , as I like your discoursing , I 'll have you .
And what art thou ?
A soldier , that hath served against the Scot .
Why , there are hospitals for such as you ,
I have no war , and therefore , sir , be gone .
Farewell , and perish by a soldier 's hand ,
That wouldst reward them with an hospital !
Ay , ay , these words of his move me as much
As if a goose should play the porpentine
And dart her plumes , thinking to pierce my breast ;
But yet it is no pain to speak men fair ;
I 'll flatter these , and make them live in hope .
You know that I came lately out of France ,
And yet I have not viewed my lord the King .
If I speed well , I 'll entertain you all .
We thank your worship .
I have some business , leave me to myself .
We will wait here about the court .
Do . These are not men for me ,
I must have wanton poets , pleasant wits ,
Musicians , that with touching of a string
May draw the pliant King which way I please .
Music and poetry is his delight ;
Therefore I 'll have Italian masks by night ,
Sweet speeches , comedies , and pleasing shows ;
And in the day , when he shall walk abroad ,
Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad ;
My men , like satyrs grazing on the lawns ,
Shall with their goat feet dance the antic hay .
Sometime a lovely boy in Dian 's shape ,
With hair that gilds the water as it glides ,
Crownets of pearl about his naked arms ,
And in his sportful hands an olive tree ,
To hide those parts which men delight to see ,
Shall bathe him in a spring ; and there , hard by ,
One like Act?on , peeping through the grove ,
Shall by the angry goddess be transformed ,
And running in the likeness of an hart ,
By yelping hounds pulled down , shall seem to die :
Such things as these best please his majesty ,
My lord ! Here comes the King and the nobles
From the parliament . I 'll stand aside .
Lancaster !
My lord .
That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor .
Will you not grant me this ? In spite of them
I 'll have my will ; and these two Mortimers ,
That cross me thus , shall know I am displeased .
If you love us , my lord , hate Gaveston .
That villain Mortimer ! I 'll be his death .
Mine uncle here , this Earl , and I myself ,
Were sworn unto your father at his death ,
That he should ne 'er return into the realm :
And know , my lord , ere I will break my oath ,
This sword of mine , that should offend your foes ,
Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need ,
And underneath thy banners march who will ,
For Mortimer will hang his armour up .
Mort dieu !
Well , Mortimer , I 'll make thee rue these words .
Beseems it thee to contradict thy King ?
Frown 'st thou thereat , aspiring Lancaster ?
The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows ,
And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff .
I will have Gaveston ; and you shall know
What danger 'tis to stand against your King .
Well done , Ned !
My lord , why do you thus incense your peers ,
That naturally would love and honour you ,
But for that base and obscure Gaveston ?
Four earldoms have I , besides Lancaster ,
Derby , Salisbury , Lincoln , Leicester ;
These will I sell , to give my soldiers pay ,
Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm ,
Therefore , if he be come , expel him straight .
Barons and earls , your pride hath made me mute ;
But now I 'll speak , and to the proof , I hope .
I do remember , in my father 's days ,
Lord Percy of the North , being highly moved ,
Braved Mowbery in presence of the King ;
For which , had not his highness loved him well ,
He should have lost his head ; but with his look
Th'undaunted spirit of Percy was appeased ,
And Mowbery and he were reconciled :
Yet dare you brave the King unto his face .
Brother , revenge it , and let these their heads
Preach upon poles , for trespass of their tongues .
O , our heads !
Ay , yours ; and therefore I would wish you grant .
Bridle thy anger , gentle Mortimer .
I cannot , nor I will not ; I must speak .
Cousin , our hands I hope shall fence our heads ,
And strike off his that makes you threaten us .
Come , uncle , let us leave the brainsick king ,
And henceforth parley with our naked swords .
Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads .
All Warwickshire will leave him for my sake .
And northward Lancaster hath many friends .
Adieu , my lord ; and either change your mind ,
Or look to see the throne , where you should sit ,
To float in blood , and at thy wanton head
The glozing head of thy base minion thrown .
I cannot brook these haughty menaces :
Am I a king , and must be overruled ?
Brother , display my ensigns in the field :
I 'll bandy with the barons and the earls ,
And either die or live with Gaveston .
I can no longer keep me from my lord .
What , Gaveston , welcome , kiss not my hand ;
Embrace me , Gaveston , as I do thee .
Why shouldst thou kneel ? Know 'st thou not who I am ?
Thy friend , thyself , another Gaveston .
Not Hylas was more mourned of Hercules
Than thou hast been of me since thy exile .
And , since I went from hence , no soul in hell
Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston .
I know it . Brother , welcome home my friend .
Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire ,
And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster :
I have my wish , in that I joy thy sight ;
And sooner shall the sea o 'erwhelm my land
Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence .
I here create thee Lord High Chamberlain ,
Chief Secretary to the state and me ,
Earl of Cornwall , King and Lord of Man .
My lord , these titles far exceed my worth .
Brother , the least of these may well suffice
For one of greater birth than Gaveston .
Cease , brother , for I cannot brook these words .
Thy worth , sweet friend , is far above my gifts :
Therefore , to equal it , receive my heart .
If for these dignities thou be envied ,
I 'll give thee more , for but to honour thee
Is Edward pleased with kingly regiment .
Fear 'st thou thy person ? Thou shalt have a guard :
Wantest thou gold ? Go to my treasury :
Wouldst thou be loved and feared ? Receive my seal ,
Save or condemn , and in our name command
Whatso thy mind affects or fancy likes .
It shall suffice me to enjoy your love ,
Which whiles I have , I think myself as great
As C?sar riding in the Roman street ,
With captive kings at his triumphant car .
Whither goes my lord of Coventry so fast ?
To celebrate your father 's exequies .
But is that wicked Gaveston returned ?
Ay , priest , and lives to be revenged on thee ,
That wert the only cause of his exile .
' Tis true ; and , but for reverence of these robes ,
Thou shouldst not plod one foot beyond this place .
I did no more than I was bound to do :
And , Gaveston , unless thou be reclaimed ,
As then I did incense the parliament ,
So will I now , and thou shalt back to France .
Saving your reverence , you must pardon me .
Throw off his golden mitre , rend his stole ,
And in the Channel christen him anew .
Ah , brother , lay not violent hands on him ,
For he 'll complain unto the see of Rome .
Let him complain unto the See of Hell !
I 'll be revenged on him for my exile .
No, spare his life , but seize upon his goods :
Be thou Lord Bishop , and receive his rents ,
And make him serve thee as thy chaplain .
I give him thee ; here , use him as thou wilt .
He shall to prison , and there die in bolts .
Ay , to the Tower , the Fleet , or where thou wilt .
For this offense be thou accursed of God !
Who 's there ? Convey this priest unto the Tower .
True , true !
But in the meantime , Gaveston , away ,
And take possession of his house and goods .
Come , follow me , and thou shalt have my guard
To see it done , and bring thee safe again .
What should a priest do with so fair a house ?
A prison may beseem his holiness .
' Tis true , the bishop is in the Tower ,
And goods and body given to Gaveston .
What ! Will they tyrannize upon the church ?
Ah , wicked King ! Accursed Gaveston !
This ground , which is corrupted with their steps ,
Shall be their timeless sepulchre or mine .
Well , let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure ;
Unless his breast be swordproof , he shall die .
How now ! Why droops the Earl of Lancaster ?
Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent ?
That villain Gaveston is made an earl .
An earl !
Ay , and besides Lord Chamberlain of the realm ,
And Secretary too , and Lord of Man .
We may not nor we will not suffer this .
Why post we not from hence to levy men ?
" My lord of Cornwall " now at every word ;
And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes ,
For vailing of his bonnet , one good look .
Thus , arm in arm , the King and he doth march :
Nay , more , the guard upon his lordship waits ,
And all the court begins to flatter him .
Thus leaning on the shoulder of the King ,
He nods , and scorns , and smiles at those that pass .
Doth no man take exceptions at the slave ?
All stomach him , but none dares speak a word .
Ah , that bewrays their baseness , Lancaster !
Were all the earls and barons of my mind ,
We 'd hale him from the bosom of the King ,
And at the court gate hang the peasant up ,
Who , swoll 'n with venom of ambitious pride ,
Will be the ruin of the realm and us .
Here comes my Lord of Canterbury 's grace .
His countenance bewrays he is displeased .
First , were his sacred garments rent and torn ;
Then laid they violent hands upon him ; next ,
Himself imprisoned , and his goods asseized .
This certify the Pope : away , take horse .
My lord , will you take arms against the King ?
What need I ? God himself is up in arms
When violence is offered to the church .
Then will you join with us , that be his peers ,
To banish or behead that Gaveston ?
What else , my lords ? For it concerns me near ;
The bishopric of Coventry is his .
Madam , whither walks your majesty so fast ?
Unto the forest , gentle Mortimer ,
To live in grief and baleful discontent ;
For now my lord the King regards me not ,
But dotes upon the love of Gaveston .
He claps his cheeks and hangs about his neck ,
Smiles in his face , and whispers in his ears ;
And , when I come , he frowns , as who should say ,
"go whither thou wilt , seeing I have Gaveston . "
Is it not strange that he is thus bewitched ?
Madam , return unto the court again .
That sly inveigling Frenchman we 'll exile ,
Or lose our lives ; and yet , ere that day come ,
The King shall lose his crown ; for we have power ,
And courage too , to be revenged at full .
But yet lift not your swords against the King .
No ; but we 'll lift Gaveston from hence .
And war must be the means , or he 'll stay still .
Then let him stay ; for , rather than my lord
Shall be oppressed by civil mutinies ,
I will endure a melancholy life ,
And let him frolic with his minion .
My lords , to ease all this , but hear me speak :
We and the rest , that are his counselors ,
Will meet , and with a general consent
Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals .
What we confirm the King will frustrate .
Then may we lawfully revolt from him .
But say , my lord , where shall this meeting be ?
At the New Temple .
Content .
And in the meantime , I 'll entreat you all
To cross to Lambeth , and there stay with me .
Come , then , let 's away .
Madam , farewell .
Farewell , sweet Mortimer , and , for my sake ,
Forbear to levy arms against the King .
Ay , if words will serve ; if not , I must .
Edmund , the mighty prince of Lancaster ,
That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear ,
And both the Mortimers , two goodly men ,
With Guy of Warwick , that redoubted knight ,
Are gone towards Lambeth . There let them remain .
Here is the form of Gaveston 's exile ;
May it please your lordship to subscribe your name .
Give me the paper .
Quick , quick , my lord ; I long to write my name .
But I long more to see him banished hence .
The name of Mortimer shall fright the King ,
Unless he be declined from that base peasant .
What ? Are you moved that Gaveston sits here ?
It is our pleasure ; we will have it so .
Your grace doth well to place him by your side ,
For nowhere else the new Earl is so safe .
What man of noble birth can brook this sight ?
See what a scornful look the peasant casts .
Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants ?
Ignoble vassal , that , like Phaeton ,
Aspir 'st unto the guidance of the sun !
Their downfall is at hand , their forces down :
We will not thus be faced and overpeered .
Lay hands upon that traitor Mortimer !
Lay hands upon that traitor Gaveston !
Is this the duty that you owe your king ?
We know our duties ; let him know his peers .
Whither will you bear him ? Stay , or ye shall die .
We are no traitors , therefore threaten not .
No, threaten not , my lord , but pay them home .
Were I a King ...
Thou , villain ! Wherefore talk 'st thou of a king ,
That hardly art a gentleman by birth ?
Were he a peasant , being my minion ,
I 'll make the proudest of you stoop to him .
My lord , you may not thus disparage us .
Away , I say , with hateful Gaveston !
And with the Earl of Kent that favours him .
Nay , then , lay violent hands upon your King !
Here , Mortimer , sit thou in Edward 's throne ;
Warwick and Lancaster , wear you my crown .
Was ever king thus overruled as I ?
Learn , then , to rule us better , and the realm .
What we have done , our heart blood shall maintain
Think you that we can brook this upstart pride ?
Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech .
Why are you moved ? Be patient , my lord ,
And see what we your counselors have done .
My lords , now let us all be resolute ,
And either have our wills , or lose our lives .
Meet you for this , proud overdaring peers ?
Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me ,
This isle shall fleet upon the ocean ,
And wander to the unfrequented Inde .
You know that I am legate to the Pope ;
On your allegiance to the See of Rome ,
Subscribe , as we have done , to his exile .
Curse him , if he refuse ; and then may we
Depose him , and elect another king .
Ay , there it goes ! But yet I will not yield :
Curse me , depose me , do the worst you can .
Then linger not , my lord , but do it straight .
Remember how the bishop was abused .
Either banish him that was the cause thereof ,
Or I will presently discharge these lords
Of duty and allegiance due to thee .
It boots me not to threat ; I must speak fair :
The legate of the Pope will be obeyed .
My lord , you shall be Chancellor of the realm ;
Thou , Lancaster , High Admiral of our fleet ;
Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be Earls ;
And you , lord Warwick , President of the North ;
And thou of Wales . If this content you not ,
Make several kingdoms of this monarchy ,
And share it equally amongst you all ,
So I may have some nook or corner left
To frolic with my dearest Gaveston .
Nothing shall alter us ; we are resolved .
Come , come , subscribe .
Why should you love him whom the world hates so ?
Because he loves me more than all the world .
Ah , none but rude and savage minded men
Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston ,
You that be noble-born should pity him .
You that are princely born should shake him off :
For shame , subscribe , and let the lown depart .
Urge him , my lord .
Are you content to banish him the realm ?
I see I must , and therefore am content :
Instead of ink , I 'll write it with my tears .
The King is lovesick for his minion .
' Tis done : and now , accursed hand , fall off !
Give it me : I 'll have it published in the streets .
I 'll see him presently dispatched away .
Now is my heart at ease .
And so is mine .
This will be good news to the common sort .
Be it or no , he shall not linger here .
How fast they run to banish him I love !
They would not stir , were it to do me good .
Why should a King be subject to a priest ?
Proud Rome , that hatchest such imperial grooms ,
With these thy superstitious taperlights ,
Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze ,
I 'll fire thy crazed buildings , and enforce
The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground ,
With slaughtered priests make Tiber 's channel swell ,
And banks raised higher with their sepulchres !
As for the peers , that back the clergy thus ,
If I be King , not one of them shall live .
My Lord , I hear it whispered everywhere
That I am banished and must fly the land .
' Tis true , sweet Gaveston ; oh , were it false !
The legate of the Pope will have it so ,
And thou must hence , or I shall be deposed .
But I will reign to be revenged of them ;
And therefore , sweet friend , take it patiently .
Live where thou wilt , I 'll send thee gold enough ;
And long thou shall not stay ; or , if thou dost ,
I 'll come to thee ; my love shall ne 'er decline .
Is all my hope turned to this hell of grief ?
Rend not my heart with thy too piercing words :
Thou from this land , I from myself am banished .
To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston ;
But to forsake you , in whose gracious looks
The blessedness of Gaveston remains ;
For nowhere else seeks he felicity .
And only this torments my wretched soul ,
That , whether I will or no , thou must depart .
Be Governor of Ireland in my stead ,
And there abide till fortune call thee home .
Here , take my picture , and let me wear thine .
O , might I keep thee here , as I do this ,
Happy were I , but now most miserable .
' Tis something to be pitied of a King .
Thou shalt not hence ; I 'll hide thee , Gaveston .
I shall be found , and then 'twill grieve me more .
Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater .
Therefore , with dumb embracement , let us part .
Stay , Gaveston ; I cannot leave thee thus .
For every look , my love drops down a tear :
Seeing I must go , do not renew my sorrow .
The time is little that thou hast to stay ,
And , therefore , give me leave to look my fill .
But , come , sweet friend ; I 'll bear thee on thy way .
The peers will frown .
I pass not for their anger . Come , let 's go :
O , that we might as well return as go !
Whither goes my lord ?
Fawn not on me , French strumpet . Get thee gone .
On whom but on my husband , should I fawn ?
On Mortimer ; with whom , ungentle Queen ...
I say no more , judge you the rest , my lord .
In saying this , thou wrong 'st me , Gaveston :
Is't not enough that thou corrupt 'st my lord ,
And art a bawd to his affections ,
But thou must call mine honour thus in question ?
I mean not so ; you grace must pardon me .
Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer ,
And by thy means is Gaveston exiled ,
But I would wish thee reconcile the lords ,
Or thou shalt ne 'er be reconciled to me .
Your highness knows , it lies not in my power .
Away , then ! Touch me not . Come , Gaveston .
Villain , 'tis thou that robb 'st me of my lord .
Madam , 'tis you that rob me of my lord .
Speak not unto her : let her droop and pine .
Wherein , my lord , have I deserved these words ?
Witness the tears that Isabella sheds ,
Witness this heart , that , sighing for thee , breaks ,
How dear my lord is to poor Isabel !
And witness heaven how dear thou art to me :
There weep; for , till my Gaveston be repealed ,
Assure thyself thou com 'st not in my sight .
O miserable and distressed Queen !
Would , when I left sweet France , and was embarked ,
That charming Circe , walking on the waves ,
Had changed my shape , or at the marriage day
The cup of Hymen had been full of poison ,
Or with those arms , that twined about my neck
I had been stifled , and not lived to see
The King my lord thus to abandon me !
Like frantic Juno will I fill the earth
With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries ;
For never doted Jove on Ganymede
So much as he on cursed Gaveston :
But that will more exasperate his wrath ;
I must entreat him , I must speak him fair ,
And be a means to call home Gaveston :
And yet he 'll ever dote on Gaveston ;
And so am I for ever miserable .
Look where the sister of the King of France
Sits wringing of her hands and beats her breast !
The King I fear , hath ill entreated her .
Hard is the heart that injures such a saint .
I know 'tis long of Gaveston she weeps .
Why ? He is gone .
Madam , how fares your grace ?
Ah , Mortimer , now breaks the King 's hate forth ,
And he confesseth that he loves me not !
Cry quittance , madam , then , and love not him .
No, rather will I die a thousand deaths ,
And yet I love in vain ; he 'll ne 'er love me .
Fear ye not , madam ; now his minion 's gone ,
His wanton humour will be quickly left .
O , never , Lancaster ! I am enjoined
To sue unto you all for his repeal :
This wills my lord , and this must I perform ,
Or else be banished from his highness ' presence .
For his repeal ? Madam ! he comes not back ,
Unless the sea cast up his shipwracked body .
And to behold so sweet a sight as that ,
There 's none here but would run his horse to death .
But , madam , would you have us call him home ?
Ay , Mortimer , for , till he be restored ,
The angry King hath banished me the court ;
And , therefore , as thou lov'st and tender 'st me ,
Be thou my advocate unto these peers .
What , would you have me plead for Gaveston ?
Plead for him he that will , I am resolved .
And so am I , my lord . Dissuade the Queen .
O , Lancaster , let him dissuade the King ,
For 'tis against my will he should return .
Then speak not for him ; let the peasant go .
' Tis for myself I speak , and not for him .
No speaking will prevail ; and therefore cease .
Fair Queen , forbear to angle for the fish
Which , being caught , strikes him that takes it dead ;
I mean that vile torpedo , Gaveston ,
That now , I hope , floats on the Irish seas .
Sweet Mortimer , sit down by me a while ,
And I will tell thee reasons of such weight
As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal .
It is impossible : but speak your mind .
Then thus ; but none shall hear it but ourselves .
My lords , albeit the Queen win Mortimer ,
Will you be resolute and hold with me ?
Not I , against my nephew .
Fear not ; the Queen 's words cannot alter him .
No ? Do but mark how earnestly she pleads !
And see how coldly his looks make denial !
She smiles : now , for my life , his mind is changed !
I 'll rather lose his friendship , I , than grant .
Well , of necessity it must be so .
My lords , that I abhor base Gaveston
I hope your honours make no question ,
And therefore , though I plead for his repeal ,
' Tis not for his sake , but for our avail ;
Nay , for the realm 's behoof , and for the King 's .
Fie , Mortimer , dishonour not thyself !
Can this be true , 'twas good to banish him ?
And is this true , to call him home again ?
Such reasons make white black , and dark night day .
My lord of Lancaster , mark the respect .
In no respect can contraries be true .
Yet , good my lord , hear what he can allege .
All that he speaks is nothing ; we are resolved .
Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead ?
I would he were !
Why then , my lord , give me but leave to speak .
But , nephew , do not play the sophister .
This which I urge is of a burning zeal
To mend the King and do our country good .
Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold ,
Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
As he will front the mightiest of us all ?
And whereas he shall live and be beloved ,
' Tis hard for us to work his overthrow .
Mark you but that , my lord of Lancaster .
But , were he here , detested as he is ,
How easily might some base slave be suborned
To greet his lordship with a poniard ;
And none so much as blame the murderer ,
But rather praise him for that brave attempt ,
And in the chronicle enroll his name
For purging of the realm of such a plague !
He saith true .
Ay , but how chance this was not done before ?
Because , my lords , it was not thought upon ;
Nay , more , when he shall know it lies in us
To banish him , and then to call him home ,
' Twill make him vail the top flag of his pride ,
And fear to offend the meanest nobleman .
But how if he do not , nephew ?
Then may we with some colour rise in arms ;
For , howsoever we have borne it out ,
' Tis treason to be up against the King .
So shall we have the people of our side ,
Which , for his father 's sake lean to the King ,
But cannot brook a night-grown mushrump ,
Such a one as my lord of Cornwall is ,
Should bear us down of the nobility .
And , when the commons and the nobles join ,
' Tis not the King can buckler Gaveston .
We 'll pull him from the strongest hold he hath .
My lords , if to perform this I be slack ,
Think me as base a groom as Gaveston .
On that condition Lancaster will grant .
And so will Pembroke .
And I.
And I.
In this I count me highly gratified ,
And Mortimer will rest at your command .
And when this favour Isabel forgets ,
Then let her live abandoned and forlorn .
But see , in happy time , my lord the King ,
Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way ,
Is new returned . This news will glad him much :
Yet not so much as me . I love him more
Than he can Gaveston : would he loved me
But half so much ! Then were I treble blest .
He 's gone , and for his absence thus I mourn .
Did never sorrow go so near my heart
As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston ?
And , could my crown 's revenue bring him back ,
I would freely give it to his enemies ,
And think I gained , having bought so dear a friend .
Hark , how he harps upon his minion !
My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow ,
Which beats upon it like the Cyclops ' hammers ,
And with the noise turns up my giddy brain ,
And makes me frantic for my Gaveston .
Ah , had some bloodless Fury rose from hell ,
And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead ,
When I was forced to leave my Gaveston !
My gracious lord , I come to bring you news .
That you have parlied with your Mortimer ?
That Gaveston , my lord , shall be repealed .
Repealed ! The news is too sweet to be true .
But will you love me , if you find it so ?
If it be so , what will not Edward do ?
For Gaveston , but not for Isabel .
For thee , fair Queen , if thou lovest Gaveston ,
I 'll hang a golden tongue about thy neck ,
Seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success .
No other jewels hang about my neck
Than these , my lord ; nor let me have more wealth
Than I may fetch from this rich treasury .
O , how a kiss revives poor Isabel !
Once more receive my hand ; and let this be
A second marriage 'twixt thyself and me .
And may it prove more happy than the first !
My gentle lord , bespeak these nobles fair ,
That wait attendance for a gracious look ,
And on their knees salute your majesty .
Courageous Lancaster , embrace thy King ;
And , as gross vapours perish by the sun ,
Even so let hatred with thy sovereign 's smile :
Live thou with me as my companion .
This salutation overjoys my heart .
Warwick shall be my chiefest counselor .
These silver hairs will more adorn my court
Than gaudy silks or rich embroidery .
Chide me , sweet Warwick , if I go astray .
Slay me , my lord , when I offend your grace .
In solemn triumphs and in public shows
Pembroke shall bear the sword before the King .
And with this sword Pembroke will fight for you .
But wherefore walks young Mortimer aside ?
Be thou commander of our royal fleet ;
Or if that lofty office like thee not ,
I make thee here Lord Marshal of the realm .
My lord , I 'll marshal so your enemies ,
As England shall be quiet , and you safe .
And as for you , Lord Mortimer of Chirk ,
Whose great achievements in our foreign war
Deserve no common place nor mean reward ,
Be you the general of the levied troops
That now are ready to assail the Scots .
In this your grace hath highly honoured me ,
For with my nature war doth best agree .
Now is the King of England rich and strong ,
Having the love of his renowned peers .
Ay , Isabel , ne 'er was my heart so light .
Clerk of the crown , direct our warrant forth ,
For Gaveston , to Ireland ! Beaumont fly ,
As fast as Iris or Jove 's Mercury .
It shall be done , my gracious lord .
Lord Mortimer , we leave you to your charge .
Now let us in , and feast it royally .
Against our friend the Earl of Cornwall comes
We 'll have a general tilt and tournament ;
And then his marriage shall be solemnized ;
For wot you not that I have made him sure
Unto our cousin , the Earl of Gloucester 's heir ?
Such news we hear , my lord .
That day , if not for him , yet for my sake ,
Who in the triumph will be challenger ,
Spare for no cost ; we will requite your love .
In this or aught your highness shall command us .
Thanks , gentle Warwick . Come , let 's in and revel .
Nephew , I must to Scotland : thou stayest here .
Leave now to oppose thyself against the King :
Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm ;
And seeing his mind so dotes on Gaveston ,
Let him without controlment have his will .
The mightiest Kings have had their minions
Great Alexander loved Hephaestion ,
The conquering Hercules for Hylas wept ,
And for Patroclus stern Achilles droop 'd .
And not kings only , but the wisest men ;
The Roman Tully loved Octavius ,
Grave Socrates wild Alcibiades .
Then let his grace , whose youth is flexible ,
And promiseth as much as we can wish ,
Freely enjoy that vain lightheaded earl ;
For riper years will wean him from such toys .
Uncle , his wanton humour grieves not me ;
But this I scorn , that one so basely born
Should by his sovereign 's favour grow so pert ,
And riot it with the treasure of the realm ,
While soldiers mutiny for want of pay .
He wears a lord 's revenue on his back ,
And , Midas-like , he jets it in the court ,
With base outlandish cullions at his heels ,
Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show
As if that Proteus , god of shapes , appeared .
I have not seen a dapper jack so brisk .
He wears a short Italian hooded cloak ,
Larded with pearl , and in his Tuscan cap
A jewel of more value than the crown .
While others walk below , the King and he ,
From out a window , laugh at such as we ,
And flout our train , and jest at our attire .
Uncle , 'tis this that makes me impatient .
But , nephew , now you see the King is changed .
Then so am I , and live to do him service :
But , while I have a sword , a hand , a heart ,
I will not yield to any such upstart .
You know my mind : come , uncle , let 's away .
Spencer ,
Seeing that our lord th ' Earl of Gloucester 's dead ,
Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve ?
Not Mortimer , nor any of his side ,
Because the King and he are enemies .
Baldock , learn this of me : a factious lord
Shall hardly do himself good , much less us ;
But he that hath the favour of a King
May with one word advance us while we live .
The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man
On whose good fortune Spencer 's hope depends .
What , mean you , then , to be his follower ?
No, his companion , for he loves me well .
And would have once preferred me to the King .
But he is banished ; there 's small hope of him .
Ay , for a while ; but , Baldock , mark the end .
A friend of mine told me in secrecy
That he 's repealed and sent for back again ;
And even now a post came from the court
With letters to our lady from the King ;
And , as she read , she smiled ; which makes me think
It is about her lover Gaveston .
' Tis like enough ; for , since he was exiled ,
She neither walks abroad nor comes in sight .
But I had thought the match had been broke off ,
And that his banishment had changed her mind .
Our lady 's first love is not wavering ;
My life for thine , she will have Gaveston .
Then hope I by her means to be preferred ,
Having read unto her since she was a child .
Then , Baldock , you must cast the scholar off ,
And learn to court it like a gentleman .
' Tis not a black coat and a little band ,
A velvet caped cloak , faced before with serge ,
And smelling to a nosegay all the day ,
Or holding of a napkin in your hand ,
Or saying a long grace at a table 's end ,
Or making low legs to a nobleman ,
Or looking downward , with your eyelids close ,
And saying , " truly , an't may please your honour , "
Can get you any favour with great men :
You must be proud , bold , pleasant , resolute ,
And now and then stab , as occasion serves .
Spencer , thou knowest I hate such formal toys ,
And use them but of mere hypocrisy .
Mine old lord whiles he lived , was so precise ,
That he would take exceptions at my buttons ,
And being like pins ' heads , blame me for the bigness ,
Which made me curate-like in mine attire ,
Though inwardly licentious enough ,
And apt for any kind of villainy .
I am none of these common pedants I ,
And hath a special gift to form a verb .
Leave off this jesting , here my lady comes .
The grief for his exile was not so much ,
As is the joy of his returning home .
This letter came from my sweet Gaveston .
What needst thou love , thus to excuse thyself ?
I know thou couldst not come and visit me .
' I will not long be from thee though I die : '
This argues the entire love of my lord .
' When I forsake thee , death seize on my heart , '
But rest thee here where Gaveston shall sleep.
Now to the letter of my lord the King .
He wills me to repair unto the court ,
And meet my Gaveston . Why do I stay ,
Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage day ?
Who 's there ? Baldock !
See that my coach be ready , I must hence .
It shall be done , madam .
And meet me at the park pale presently .
Spencer , stay you and bear me company ,
For I have joyful news to tell thee of .
My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over ,
And will be at the court as soon as we .
I knew the King would have him home again .
If all things sort out , as I hope they will ,
Thy service , Spencer , shall be thought upon .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Come lead the way , I long till I am there .
The wind is good , I wonder why he stays ,
I fear me he is wracked upon the sea .
Look Lancaster how passionate he is ,
And still his mind runs on his minion .
My lord .
How now , what news ? Is Gaveston arrived ?
Nothing but Gaveston ! What means your grace ?
You have matters of more weight to think upon ,
The King of France sets foot in Normandy .
A trifle ! We 'll expel him when we please .
But tell me Mortimer , what 's thy device ,
Against the stately triumph we decreed ?
A homely one my lord , not worth the telling .
Prithee let me know it .
But seeing you 're so desirous , thus it is :
A lofty cedar tree fair flourishing ,
On whose top branches kingly eagles perch ,
And by the bark a canker creeps me up ,
And gets unto the highest bough of all .
And what is yours , my lord of Lancaster ?
My lord , mine 's more obscure than Mortimer 's .
Pliny reports , there is a flying fish ,
Which all the other fishes deadly hate ,
And therefore being pursued , it takes the air :
No sooner is it up , but there 's a fowl
That seizeth it : this fish , my lord , I bear ,
Proud Mortimer , ungentle Lancaster ,
Is this the love you bear your sovereign ?
Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears ?
Can you in words make show of amity ,
And in your shields display your rancourous minds ?
What call you this but private libeling
Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother ?
Sweet husband , be content ; they all love you .
They love me not that hate my Gaveston .
I am that cedar ; shake me not too much ;
And you the eagles , soar ye ne 'er so high ,
I have the jesses that will pull you down ;
Unto the proudest peer of Brittany .
Though thou compar 'st him to a flying fish ,
And threatenest death whether he rise or fall ,
' Tis not the hugest monster of the sea ,
Nor foulest harpy , that shall swallow him .
If in his absence thus he favours him ,
What will he do whenas he shall be present ?
That shall we see : look , where his lordship comes !
My Gaveston !
Welcome to Tynemouth ! Welcome to thy friend !
Thy absence made me droop and pine away ;
For , as the lovers of fair Danae ,
When she was locked up in a brazen tower ,
Desired her more , and waxed outrageous ,
So did it sure with me : and now thy sight
Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart .
Sweet lord and king , your speech preventeth mine ,
Yet have I words left to express my joy :
The shepherd , nipped with biting winter 's rage ,
Frolics not more to see the painted spring
Than I do to behold your majesty .
Will none of you salute my Gaveston ?
Salute him ? Yes . Welcome , Lord Chamberlain !
Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall !
Welcome , Lord Governor of the Isle of Man !
Welcome , master Secretary !
Brother , do you hear them ?
Still will these earls and barons use me thus ?
My lord , I cannot brook these injuries .
Ay me , poor soul , when these begin to jar !
Return it to their throats ; I 'll be thy warrant .
Base , leaden earls , that glory in your birth ,
Go sit at home , and eat your tenants ' beef ;
And come not here to scoff at Gaveston ,
Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
As to bestow a look on such as you .
Yet I disdain not to do this for you .
Treason , treason ! Where 's the traitor ?
Here , here !
Convey hence Gaveston ; they 'll murder him .
The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace .
Villain , thy life unless I miss mine aim .
Ah , furious Mortimer , what hast thou done ?
No more than I would answer , were he slain .
Yes , more than thou canst answer , though he live ;
Dear shall you both aby this riotous deed .
Out of my presence ! Come not near the court .
I 'll not be barred the court for Gaveston .
We 'll hale him by the ears unto the block .
Look to your own heads ; his is sure enough .
Look to your own crown , if you back him thus .
Warwick , these words do ill beseem thy years .
Nay , all of them conspire to cross me thus ;
But , if I live , I 'll tread upon their heads ,
That think with high looks thus to tread me down .
Come , Edmund , let 's away , and levy men ;
' Tis war that must abate these barons ' pride .
Let 's to our castles , for the King is moved .
Moved may he be , and perish in his wrath !
Cousin , it is no dealing with him now ;
He means to make us stoop by force of arms :
And therefore let us jointly here protest
To prosecute that Gaveston to the death .
By heaven , the abject villain shall not live !
I 'll have his blood , or die in seeking it .
The like oath Pembroke takes .
And so doth Lancaster .
Now send our heralds to defy the King ;
And make the people swear to put him down .
Letters ? From whence ?
From Scotland , my lord .
Why , how now , cousin , how fare all our friends ?
My uncle 's taken prisoner by the Scots .
We 'll have him ransomed , man , be of good cheer .
They rate his ransom at five thousand pound .
Who should defray the money but the King ,
Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars ?
I 'll to the King .
Do , cousin , and I 'll bear thee company .
Meantime my lord of Pembroke and myself
Will to Newcastle here , and gather head .
About it , then , and we will follow you .
Be resolute and full of secrecy .
I warrant you .
Cousin , and if he will not ransom him ,
I 'll thunder such a peal into his ears
As never subject did unto his king .
Content ; I 'll bear my part . Holla , who 's there ?
Ay , marry , such a guard as this doth well .
Lead on the way .
Whither will your lordships ?
Whither else but to the King ?
His highness is disposed to be alone .
Why , so he may ; but we will speak to him .
You may not in , my lord .
May we not ?
How now , what noise is this ?
Who have we there ? Is't you ?
Nay , stay , my lord ; I come to bring you news ;
Mine uncle 's taken prisoner by the Scots .
Then ransom him .
' Twas in your wars . You should ransom him .
And you shall ransom him , or else ...
What , Mortimer , you will not threaten him ?
Quiet yourself , you shall have the broad seal ,
To gather for him throughout the realm .
Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this .
My lord , the family of the Mortimers
Are not so poor , but , would they sell their land
' Twould levy men enough to anger you .
We never beg , but use such prayers as these .
Shall I still be haunted thus ?
Nay , now you are here alone , I 'll speak my mind .
And so will I ; and then , my lord , farewell .
The idle triumphs , masks , lascivious shows ,
And prodigal gifts bestowed on Gaveston ,
Have drawn thy treasure dry , and made thee weak ;
The murmuring commons overstretched hath .
Look for rebellion , look to be deposed .
Thy garrisons are beaten out of France ,
And , lame and poor , lie groaning at the gates ;
The wild O'Neill , with swarms of Irish kerns ,
Lives uncontrolled within the English pale ;
Unto the walls of York the Scots make road ,
And , unresisted , draw away rich spoils .
The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas ,
While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigged .
What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors ?
Who loves thee , but a sort of flatterers ?
Thy gentle Queen , sole sister to Valois ,
Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn .
Thy court is naked , being bereft of those
That make a king seem glorious to the world ,
I mean the peers , whom thou shouldst dearly love ;
Libels are cast against thee in the street ;
Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow .
The northern borderers , seeing the houses burnt ,
Their wives and children slain , run up and down ,
Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston .
When wert thou in the field with banner spread ?
But once , and then thy soldiers marched like players ,
With garish robes , not armour ; and thyself ,
Bedaubed with gold , rode laughing at the rest ,
Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest ,
Where women 's favours hung like labels down .
And thereof came it that the fleering Scots ,
To England 's high disgrace , have made this jig ;
Maids of England , sore may you mourn ,
For your lemans you have lost at Bannocksbourn ,
With a heave and a ho!
What weeneth the King of England
So soon to have won Scotland ?
With a rombelow !
Wigmore shall fly to set my uncle free .
And , when 'tis gone , our swords shall purchase more .
If ye be moved , revenge it as you can :
Look next to see us with our ensigns spread
My swelling heart for very anger breaks .
How oft have I been baited by these peers ,
And dare not be revenged , for their power is great ;
Yet , shall the crowing of these cockerels
Affright a lion ? Edward , unfold thy paws ,
And let their lives ' blood slake thy fury 's hunger .
If I be cruel and grow tyrannous ,
Now let them thank themselves , and rue too late .
My lord , I see your love to Gaveston
Will be the ruin of the realm and you ,
For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars ;
And therefore , brother , banish him forever .
Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston ?
Ay , and it grieves me that I favoured him .
Traitor , be gone ! Whine thou with Mortimer .
So will I , rather than with Gaveston .
Out of my sight , and trouble me no more !
No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers ,
When I thy brother am rejected thus .
Away ! Poor Gaveston , thou hast no friend but me ,
Do what they can , we 'll live in Tynemouth here ;
And , so I walk with him about the walls ,
What care I though the earls begirt us round ?
Here comes she that is cause of all these jars .
My lord , 'tis thought the earls are up in arms .
Ay , and 'tis likewise thought you favour 'em .
Thus do you still suspect me without cause .
Sweet uncle , speak more kindly to the Queen .
My lord , dissemble with her ; speak her fair .
Pardon me , sweet ; I forgot myself .
Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel .
The younger Mortimer is grown so brave ,
That to my face he threatens civil wars .
Why do you not commit him to the Tower ?
I dare not , for the people love him well .
Why , then , we 'll have him privily made away .
Would Lancaster and he had both caroused
A bowl of poison to each other 's health !
But let them go , and tell me what are these .
Two of my father 's servants whilst he lived :
May 't please your grace to entertain them now .
Tell me , where wast thou born ?
What is thine arms ?
My name is Baldock , and my gentry
I fetch 'd from Oxford , not from heraldry .
The fitter art thou , Baldock , for my turn .
Wait on me , and I 'll see thou shalt not want .
I humbly thank your majesty .
Knowest thou him , Gaveston ?
Ay , my lord ;
His name is Spencer ; he is well allied .
For my sake let him wait upon your grace ;
Scarce shall you find a man of more desert .
Then , Spencer , wait upon me . For his sake
I 'll grace thee with a higher style ere long .
No greater titles happen unto me
Than to be favoured of your majesty !
Cousin , this day shall be your marriage feast ;
And , Gaveston , think that I love thee well ,
To wed thee to our niece , the only heir
Unto the Earl of Gloucester late deceased .
I know , my lord , many will stomach me ;
But I respect neither their love nor hate .
The headstrong barons shall not limit me ;
He that I list to favour shall be great .
Come , let 's away ; and , when the marriage ends ,
Have at the rebels and their 'complices !
My lords , of love to this our native land ,
I come to join with you , and leave the King ;
And in your quarrel , and the realm 's behoof ,
Will be the first that shall adventure life .
I fear me , you are sent of policy ,
To undermine us with a show of love .
He is your brother ; therefore have we cause
To cast the worst , and doubt of your revolt .
Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth :
If that will not suffice , farewell , my lords .
Stay , Edmund : never was Plantagenet
False of his word ; and therefore trust we thee .
But what 's the reason you should leave him now ?
I have informed the Earl of Lancaster .
And it sufficeth . Now , my lords , know this ,
That Gaveston is secretly arrived ,
And here in Tynemouth frolics with the King .
Let us with these our followers scale the walls ,
And suddenly surprise them unawares .
I 'll give the onset .
And I 'll follow thee .
This tottered ensign of my ancestors ,
Which swept the desert shore of that dead sea
Whereof we got the name of Mortimer ,
Will I advance upon these castle walls ,
Drums , strike alarum , raise them from their sport ,
And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston !
None be so hardy as to touch the King ;
But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends .
O , tell me , Spencer , where is Gaveston ?
I fear me he is slain , my gracious lord .
No, here he comes ; now let them spoil and kill .
Fly , fly , my lords ; the earls have got the hold ;
Take shipping , and away to Scarborough .
Spencer and I will post away by land .
O stay , my lord , they will not injure you .
I will not trust them , Gaveston , away !
Farewell , my lord .
Lady , farewell .
Farewell , sweet uncle , till we meet again .
Farewell , sweet Gaveston ; and farewell , niece .
No farewell to poor Isabel thy Queen ?
Yes , yes , for Mortimer your lover 's sake .
Heavens can witness , I love none but you .
From my embracements thus he breaks away .
O , that mine arms could close this isle about ,
That I might pull him to me where I would ,
Or that these tears , that drizzle from mine eyes ,
Had power to mollify his stony heart ,
That , when I had him , we might never part !
I wonder how he scaped ?
Who 's this ? The Queen ?
Ay , Mortimer , the miserable Queen ,
Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted ,
And body with continual mourning wasted .
These hands are tired with haling of my lord
From Gaveston , from wicked Gaveston ;
And all in vain ; for when I speak him fair ,
He turns away , and smiles upon his minion .
Cease to lament , and tell us where 's the King ?
What would you with the King ? Is't him you seek ?
No, madam , but that cursed Gaveston .
Far be it from the thought of Lancaster
To offer violence to his sovereign !
We would but rid the realm of Gaveston .
Tell us where he remains , and he shall die .
He 's gone by water unto Scarborough ;
Pursue him quickly , and he cannot 'scape :
The King hath left him , and his train is small .
Forslow no time , sweet Lancaster ; let 's march .
How comes it that the King and he is parted ?
That this your army , going several ways ,
Might be of lesser force , and with the power
That he intendeth presently to raise ,
Be easily suppressed ; and therefore be gone !
Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy ;
Let 's all aboard , and follow him amain .
The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails ;
Come , come , aboard ! 'tis but an hour 's sailing .
No Mortimer ; I 'll to my lord the King .
Nay , rather sail with us to Scarborough .
You know the King is so suspicious
As , if he hear I have but talked with you ,
Mine honour will be called in question ;
And therefore , gentle Mortimer , be gone .
Madam , I cannot stay to answer you ;
But think of Mortimer as he deserves .
So well hast thou deserved , sweet Mortimer ,
As Isabel could live with thee forever .
In vain I look for love at Edward 's hand ,
Whose eyes are fixed on none but Gaveston ;
Yet once more I 'll importune him with prayers .
If he be strange , and not regard my words ,
My son and I will over into France ,
And to the King my brother there complain
How Gaveston hath robbed me of his love ;
But yet , I hope , my sorrows will have end ,
And Gaveston this blessed day be slain .
Yet , lusty lords , I have escaped your hands ,
Your threats , your 'larums , and your hot pursuits ;
And , though divorced from King Edward 's eyes ,
Yet liveth Piers of Gaveston unsurprised ,
That muster rebels thus against your king -
To see his royal sovereign once again .
Upon him , soldiers , take away his weapons !
Thou proud disturber of thy country 's peace ,
Corrupter of thy King , cause of these broils ,
Base flatterer , yield , and , were it not for shame ,
Shame and dishonour to a soldier 's name ,
Upon my weapon 's point here shouldst thou fall ,
And welter in thy gore .
Monster of men ,
That , like the Greekish strumpet , trained to arms
And bloody wars so many valiant knights ,
Look for no other fortune , wretch , than death !
King Edward is not here to buckler thee .
Lancaster , why talk 'st thou to the slave ?
Go , soldiers , take him hence ; for , by my sword ,
His head shall off . Gaveston , short warning
Shall serve thy turn : it is our country 's cause
That here severely we will execute
Upon thy person . Hang him at a bough .
My lord -
Soldiers , have him away .
But , for thou wert the favourite of a king ,
Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands .
I thank you all , my lords : then I perceive
That heading is one , and hanging is the other ,
And death is all .
How now , my lord of Arundel !
My lords , King Edward greets you all by me .
Arundel , say your message .
His majesty ,
Hearing that you had taken Gaveston ,
Entreateth you by me , yet but he may
See him before he dies , for why , he says ,
And sends you word , he knows that die he shall ;
And , if you gratify his grace so far ,
He will be mindful of the courtesy .
How now !
Renowned Edward , how thy name
Revives poor Gaveston !
No, it needeth not .
Arundel , we will gratify the King
In other matters ; he must pardon us in this .
Soldiers , away with him !
Why , my lord of Warwick ,
Will not these delays beget my hopes ?
I know it , lords , it is this life you aim at ,
Yet grant King Edward this .
Shalt thou appoint
What we shall grant ? Soldiers , away with him !
Thus we 'll gratify the King ;
We 'll send his head by thee ; let him bestow
His tears on that , for that is all he gets
Of Gaveston , or else his senseless trunk .
Not so , my lord , lest he bestow more cost
In burying him than he hath ever earned .
My lords , it is his majesty 's request ,
And in the honour of a king he swears ,
He will but talk with him , and send him back .
When , can you tell ? Arundel , no ; we wot ,
He that the care of realm remits ,
And drives his nobles to these exigents
For Gaveston , will , if he seize him once ,
Violate any promise to possess him .
Then , if you will not trust his grace in keep ,
My Lords , I will be pledge for his return .
It is honourable in thee to offer this ;
But , for we know thou art a noble gentleman ,
We will not wrong thee so ,
To make away a true man for a thief .
How mean 'st thou , Mortimer ? That is overbase .
Away , base groom , robber of king 's renown !
Question with thy companions and mates .
My lord Mortimer , and you , my lords , each one ,
To gratify the King 's request therein ,
Touching the sending of this Gaveston ,
Because his majesty so earnestly
Desires to see the man before his death ,
I will upon mine honour undertake
To carry him , and bring him back again ;
Provided this , that you , my lord of Arundel ,
Will join with me .
Pembroke , what wilt thou do ?
Cause yet more bloodshed ? Is it not enough
That we have taken him , but must we now
Leave him on "had I wist , " and let him go ?
My lords , I will not overwoo your honours ,
But , if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner ,
Upon mine oath , I will return him back .
My lord of Lancaster , what say you in this ?
Why , I say , let him go on Pembroke 's word .
And you , lord Mortimer ?
How say you , my lord of Warwick ?
Nay , do your pleasures : I know how 'twill prove .
Then give him me .
Sweet sovereign , yet I come
To see thee ere I die !
Yet not perhaps ,
If Warwick 's wit and policy prevail .
My lord of Pembroke , we deliver him you :
Return him on our honour , sound , away !
My lord , you shall go with me :
My house is not far hence , out of the way
A little , but our men shall go along .
We that have pretty wenches to our wives ,
Sir , must not come so near and balk their lips .
' Tis very kindly spoke , my lord of Pembroke ;
Your honour hath an adamant of power
To draw a prince .
So , my lord . Come hither , James .
I do commit this Gaveston to thee .
Be thou this night his keeper ; in the morning
We will discharge thee of thy charge . Be gone .
Unhappy Gaveston , whither goest thou now ?
My lord , we 'll quickly be at Cobham .
O treacherous Warwick , thus to wrong thy friend !
I see it is your life these arms pursue .
Weaponless must I fall , and die in bands ?
O , must this day be period of my life ,
Center of all my bliss ! And ye be men ,
Speed to the King .
My lord of Pembroke 's men ,
Strive you no longer . I will have that Gaveston .
Your lordship doth dishonour to yourself ,
And wrong our lord , your honourable friend .
No, James , it is my country 's cause I follow .
Go , take the villain : soldiers , come away ;
We 'll make quick work . Commend me to your master ,
My friend , and tell him that I watched it well .
Come , let thy shadow parley with King Edward .
Treacherous Earl , shall I not see the King ?
The King of Heaven perhaps , no other King .
Come , fellows , it booted not for us to strive ;
We will in haste go certify our lord .
I long to hear an answer from the barons
Touching my friend , my dearest Gaveston .
Ah , Spencer , not the riches of my realm
Can ransom him , ah , he is marked to die .
I know the malice of the younger Mortimer .
Warwick I know is rough , and Lancaster
Inexorable , and I shall never see
My lovely Piers , my Gaveston again .
The barons overbear me with their pride .
Were I King Edward , England 's sovereign ,
Son to the lovely Eleanor of Spain ,
Great Edward Longshanks ' issue , would I bear
These braves , this rage , and suffer uncontrolled
These barons thus to beard me in my land ,
In mine own realm ? My lord , pardon my speech .
Did you retain your father 's magnanimity ,
Did you regard the honour of your name ,
You would not suffer thus your majesty
Be counterbuffed of your nobility .
Strike off their heads , and let them preach on poles .
No doubt , such lessons they will teach the rest ,
As by their preachments they will profit much
And learn obedience to their lawful king .
Yea , gentle Spencer , we have been too mild ,
Too kind to them ; but now have drawn our sword ,
And , if they send me not my Gaveston ,
We 'll steel it on their crest and poll their tops .
This haught resolve becomes your majesty ,
Not to be tied to their affection ,
As though your highness were a schoolboy still ,
And must be awed and governed like a child .
SPENCER THE FATHER . Long live my sovereign , the noble Edward ,
In peace triumphant , fortunate in wars !
Welcome , old man : com 'st thou in Edward 's aid ?
Then tell thy prince of whence and what thou art .
SPENCER THE FATHER . Lo , with a band of bowmen and of pikes ,
Brown bills and targeteers , 400 strong ,
Sworn to defend King Edward 's royal right ,
I come in person to your majesty ,
Spencer , the father of Hugh Spencer there ,
Bound to you highness everlastingly
For favours done , in him , unto us all .
Thy father , Spencer ?
True , and it like your grace ,
That pours , in lieu of all your goodness shown ,
His life , my lord , before your princely feet .
Welcome ten thousand times , old man , again !
Spencer , this love , this kindness to thy king ,
Argues thy noble mind and disposition .
Spencer , I here create thee Earl of Wiltshire ,
And daily will enrich thee with our favour
That as the sunshine , shall reflect o 'er thee .
Besides , the more to manifest our love ,
Because we hear Lord Bruce doth sell his land
And that the Mortimers are in hand withal ,
Thou shalt have crowns of us t ' outbid the barons ;
And , Spencer , spare them not , but lay it on .
Soldiers , a largess , and thrice welcome all !
My lord , here comes the Queen .
Madam , what news ?
News of dishonour , lord , and discontent .
Our friend Levune , faithful and full of trust ,
Informeth us , by letters and by words
That lord Valois our brother , King of France ,
Because your highness hath been slack in homage ,
Hath seized Normandy into his hands .
These be the letters , this the messenger .
Welcome , Levune . Tush , Sib , if this be all ,
Valois and I will soon be friends again .
But to my Gaveston : shall I never see ,
Never behold thee now ? Madam , in this matter
We will employ you and your little son :
You shall go parley with the King of France .
Boy , see you bear you bravely to the King ,
And do your message with a majesty .
Commit not to my youth things of more weight
Than fits a prince so young as I to bear ;
And fear not , lord and father , heaven 's great beams
On Atlas ' shoulder shall not lie more safe
Than shall your charge committed to my trust .
Ah , boy , this towardness makes thy mother fear
Thou are not marked to many days on earth !
Madam , we will that you with speed be shipped ,
And this our son ; Levune shall follow you
With all the haste we can dispatch him hence .
Choose of our lords to bear you company ,
And go in peace ; leave us in wars at home .
Unnatural wars , where subjects brave their king :
God end them once ! My lord , I take my leave
To make my preparation for France .
What , lord Arundel , dost thou come alone ?
Yea , my good lord , for Gaveston is dead .
Ah , traitors . Have they put my friend to death ?
Tell me , Arundel , died he ere thou cam 'st ,
Or didst thou see my friend to take his death ?
Neither , my lord ; for , as he was surprised ,
Begirt with weapons and with enemies round ,
I did your highness ' message to them all ,
Demanding him of them , entreating rather ,
And said , upon the honour of my name ,
That I would undertake to carry him
Unto your highness , and to bring him back .
And tell me , would the rebels deny me that ?
Proud recreants !
Yea , Spencer , traitors all !
I found them at the first inexorable .
The Earl of Warwick would not bide the hearing ,
Mortimer hardly ; Pembroke and Lancaster
Spake least . And when they flatly had denied ,
Refusing to receive me pledge for him ,
The Earl of Pembroke mildly thus bespake :
" My lords , because our sovereign sends for him
And promiseth he shall be safe returned ,
I will this undertake , to have him hence
And see him redelivered to your hands . "
Well , and how fortunes it that he came not ?
Some treason or some villainy was cause .
The Earl of Warwick seized him on his way ;
For being delivered unto Pembroke 's men ,
Their lord rode home thinking his prisoner safe ;
But ere he came , Warwick in ambush lay ,
And bare him to his death , and in a trench
Strake off his head , and marched unto the camp .
A bloody part , flatly against law of arms .
O shall I speak , or shall I sigh and die !
My lord , refer your vengeance to the sword
Upon these barons ; hearten up your men ;
Let them not unrevenged murder your friends .
Advance your standard , Edward , in the field ,
And march to fire them from their starting holes .
By heaven , and all the moving orbs thereof ,
By this right hand , and by my father 's sword ,
And all the honours 'longing to my crown ,
I will have heads and lives for him as many
As I have manors , castles , towns , and towers !
Treacherous Warwick ! Traitorous Mortimer !
If I be England 's king , in lakes of gore
Your headless trunks , your bodies will I trail ,
That you may drink your fill , and quaff in blood ,
And stain my royal standard with the same ,
That so my bloody colours may suggest
Remembrance of revenge immortally
On your accursed traitorous progeny ,
You villains that have slain my Gaveston !
And in this place of honour and of trust ,
Spencer , sweet Spencer , I adopt thee here ;
And merely of our love we do create thee
Earl of Gloucester and Lord Chamberlain ,
Despite of times , despite of enemies .
My lord , here 's a messenger from the barons
Desires access unto your majesty .
Admit him near .
Long live King Edward , England 's lawful lord !
So wish not they , I wis , that sent thee hither .
Thou com 'st from Mortimer and his 'complices ;
A ranker rout of rebels never was .
Well , say thy message .
The barons up in arms by me salute
Your highness with long life and happiness ,
And bid me say , as plainer to your grace ,
That if without effusion of blood
You will this grief have ease and remedy ,
That from your princely person you remove
This Spencer , as a putrifying branch
That deads the royal vine , whose golden leaves
Empale your princely head , your diadem
Whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim ,
Say they , and lovingly advise your grace
To cherish virtue and nobility ,
And have old servitors in high esteem ,
And shake off smooth dissembling flatterers .
This granted , they , their honours , and their lives ,
Are to your highness vow 'd and consecrate .
Ah , traitors , will they still display their pride ?
Away ! Tarry no answer , but be gone !
Rebels , will they appoint their sovereign
His sports , his pleasures , and his company ?
Yet , ere thou go , see how I do divorce
And tell them I will come to chastise them
For murdering Gaveston . Hie thee , get thee gone !
Edward with fire and sword follows at thy heels .
My lord , perceive you how these rebels swell ?
Soldiers , good hearts , defend your sovereign 's right ,
For now , even now , we march to make them stoop .
Why do we sound retreat ? Upon them , lords !
This day I shall pour vengeance with my sword
On those proud rebels that are up in arms ,
And do confront and countermand their king .
I doubt it not , my lord ; right will prevail .
SPENCER THE FATHER . ' Tis not amiss , my liege , for either part
To breathe a while . Our men , with sweat and dust
All choked well near , begin to faint for heat ;
And this retire refresheth horse and man .
Here come the rebels .
Look , Lancaster , yonder is Edward
Among his flatterers .
And there let him be ,
Till he pay dearly for their company .
And shall , or Warwick 's sword shall smite in vain .
What , rebels , do you shrink and sound retreat ?
No, Edward , no ; thy flatterers faint and fly .
Thou 'd best betimes forsake them and their trains ,
For they 'll betray thee , traitors as they are .
Traitor on thy face , rebellious Lancaster .
Away , base upstart ! Brav 'st thou nobles thus ?
SPENCER THE FATHER . A noble attempt and honourable deed ,
Is it not , trow ye , to assemble aid
And levy arms against your lawful king ?
For which , ere long , their heads shall satisfy
T' appease the wrath of their offended king .
Then , Edward , thou wilt fight it to the last
And rather bathe thy sword in subjects ' blood
Than banish that pernicious company .
Ay , traitors all , rather than thus be braved ,
Make England 's civil towns huge heaps of stones
And plows to go about our palace gates .
A desperate and unnatural resolution .
Alarum to the fight !
Saint George for England , and the barons ' right !
Saint George for England , and King Edward 's right !
Now , lusty lords , now not by chance of war ,
But justice of the quarrel and the cause ,
Vailed is your pride . Methinks you hang the heads ,
But we 'll advance them , traitors . Now 'tis time
To be avenged on you for all your braves ,
And for the murder of my dearest friend ,
To whom right well you knew our soul was knit ,
Good Piers of Gaveston , my sweet favourite .
Ah , rebels , recreants , you made him away !
Brother , in regard of thee and of thy land ,
Did they remove that flatterer from thy throne .
So , sir , you have spoke . Away , avoid our presence !
Accursed wretches , was't in regard of us ,
When he had sent our messenger to request
He might be spared to come to speak with us ,
And Pembroke undertook for his return ,
That thou , proud Warwick , watched the prisoner ,
Poor Piers , and headed him against law of arms ?
For which thy head shall overlook the rest
As much as thou in rage outwent 'st the rest .
Tyrant , I scorn thy threats and menaces ;
' Tis but temporal that thou canst inflict .
The worst is death ; and better die to live
Than live in infamy under such a king .
Away with them , my lord of Winchester !
These lusty leaders , Warwick and Lancaster ,
I charge you roundly , off with both their heads !
Farewell , vain world !
Sweet Mortimer , farewell !
England , unkind to thy nobility ,
Groan for this grief , behold how thou art maimed !
Go , take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower ;
There see him safe bestowed ; and for the rest ,
Do speedy execution on them all .
Be gone !
What , Mortimer ? Can ragged stony walls
Immure thy virtue that aspires to heaven ?
No, Edward , England 's scourge , it may not be ;
Mortimer 's hope surmounts his fortune far .
Sound drums and trumpets , march with me , my friends .
Edward this day hath crowned him King anew .
Levune , the trust that we repose in thee
Begets the quiet of King Edward 's land .
Therefore be gone in haste , and with advice
Bestow that treasure on the lords of France ,
That , therewith all enchanted , like the guard
That suffered Jove to pass in showers of gold
To Danae , all aid may be denied
To Isabel the Queen , that now in France
Makes friends , to cross the seas with her young son ,
And step into his father 's regiment .
That 's it these barons and the subtle Queen
Long leveled at .
Yea , but , Levune , thou seest
These barons lay their heads on blocks together ;
What they intend , the hangman frustrates clean .
Have you no doubts , my lords , I 'll clap so close
Among the lords of France with England 's gold ,
That Isabel shall make her plaints in vain ,
And France shall be obdurate with her tears .
Then make for France amain ; Levune , away !
Proclaim King Edward 's wars and victories .
Fair blows the wind for France : blow , gentle gale ,
Till Edmund be arrived for England 's good ,
Nature , yield to my country 's cause in this !
A brother , no , a butcher of thy friends ,
Proud Edward , dost thou banish me thy presence ?
But I 'll to France , and cheer the wronged Queen ,
And certify what Edward 's looseness is .
Unnatural king , to slaughter noblemen
And cherish flatterers . Mortimer , I stay
Thy sweet escape . Stand gracious gloomy night
To his device .
Holla , who walketh there ?
Is't you my lord ?
Ay , Mortimer , 'tis I.
But hath thy potion wrought so happily ?
It hath , my lord . The warders all asleep ,
I thank them , gave me leave to pass in peace .
But hath your grace got shipping unto France ?
Fear it not .
Ah , boy , our friends do fail us all in France .
The lords are cruel , and the King unkind .
What shall we do ?
Madam , return to England
And please my father well ; and then a fig
For all my uncle 's friendship here in France .
I warrant you , I 'll win his highness quickly ;
' A loves me better than a thousand Spencers .
Ah , boy , thou art deceived , at least in this ,
To think that we can yet be tuned together .
No, no , we jar too far . Unkind Valois ,
Unhappy Isabel , when France rejects ,
Whither , O , whither dost thou bend thy steps ?
Madam , what cheer ?
Ah , good Sir John of Hainault ,
Never so cheerless nor so far distressed !
I hear , sweet lady , of the King 's unkindness ;
But droop not , madam ; noble minds contemn
Despair . Will your grace with me to Hainault ,
And there stay time 's advantage with your son ?
How say you , my lord , will you go with your friends ,
And shake off all our sorrows equally ?
So pleaseth the Queen my mother , me it likes .
The King of England , nor the court of France ,
Shall have me from my gracious mother 's side ,
Till I be strong enough to break a staff ;
And then have at the proudest Spencer 's head .
Well said , my lord .
Oh , my sweet heart , how do I moan thy wrongs ,
Yet triumph in the hope of thee , my joy .
Ah , sweet Sir John , even to the utmost verge
Of Europe , on the shore of Tanais ,
Will we with thee to Hainault , so we will .
The marquis is a noble gentleman ;
His grace , I dare presume , will welcome me .
But who are these ?
Madam , long may you live ,
Much happier than your friends in England do .
Lord Edmund and lord Mortimer alive ?
Welcome to France . The news was here , my lord ,
That you were dead , or very near your death .
Lady , the last was truest of the twain ,
But Mortimer , reserved for better hap ,
Hath shaken off the thralldom of the Tower
And lives t ' advance your standard , good my lord .
How mean you , and the King my father lives ?
No, my lord Mortimer , not I , I trow .
Not , son ! Why not ? I would it were no worse ,
But , gentle lords , friendless we are in France .
Monsieur le Grand , a noble friend of yours ,
Told us , at our arrival , all the news ,
How hard the nobles , how unkind the King
Hath showed himself : but madam , right makes room
Where weapons want ; and , though a many friends
Are made away , as Warwick , Lancaster ,
And others of our part and faction ,
Yet have we friends , assure your grace , in England
Would cast up caps and clap their hands for joy ,
To see us there appointed for our foes .
Would all were well , and Edward well reclaimed ,
For England 's honour , peace and quietness .
But by the sword , my lord , it must be deserved ;
The king will ne 'er forsake his flatterers .
My lords of England , sith the ungentle King
Of France refuseth to give aid of arms
To this distressed Queen , his sister , here ,
Go you with her to Hainault . Doubt ye not
We will find comfort , money , men , and friends
Ere long , to bid the English King a base .
How say , young prince , what think you of the match ?
I think King Edward will outrun us all .
Nay , son , not so ; and you must not discourage
Your friends that are so forward in your aid .
Sir John of Hainault , pardon us , I pray :
These comforts that you give our woeful Queen
Bind us in kindness all at your command .
Yea , gentle brother : and the God of heaven
Prosper your happy motion , good Sir John .
This noble gentleman , forward in arms ,
Was born , I see , to be our anchor hold .
Sir John of Hainault , be it thy renown ,
That England 's Queen and nobles in distress
Have been by thee restored and comforted .
Madam , along ; and you , my lords , with me ,
That England 's peers may Hainault 's welcome see .
Thus , after many threats of wrathful war ,
Triumpheth England 's Edward with his friends ,
And triumph Edward with his friends uncontrolled .
My lord of Gloucester , do you hear the news ?
What news , my lord ?
Why , man , they say there is great execution
Done through the realm . My lord of Arundel ,
You have the note , have you not ?
From the lieutenant of the Tower , my lord .
I pray , let us see it , what have we there ?
Why , so : they barked apace a month ago ;
Now , on my life , they 'll neither bark nor bite .
Now , sirs , the news from France . Gloucester , I trow ,
The lords of France love England 's gold so well
As Isabella gets no aid from thence .
What now remains ? Have you proclaimed , my lord ,
My lord , we have ; and , if he be in England ,
' A will be had ere long , I doubt it not .
If , dost thou say ? Spencer , as true as death ,
He is in England 's ground ; our port masters
Are not so careless of their king 's command .
How now ! What news with thee ? From whence come these ?
Letters , my lord , and tidings forth of France ;
To you , my lord of Gloucester , from Levune .
Read .
" My duty to your honour premised , etc .
I have , according to instructions in that behalf ,
dealt with the King of France his lords , and effected
that the Queen , all discontented and discomforted , is
gone ; whither , if you ask , with Sir John of Hainault ,
brother to the marquis , into Flanders . With them are
gone lord Edmund and the lord Mortimer , having in
their company divers of your nation , and others ; and ,
as constant report goeth , they intend to give King
Edward battle in England sooner than he can look for
them . This is all the news of import .
Your honour 's in all service , Levune " .
Ah , villains , hath that Mortimer escaped ?
With him is Edmund gone associate ?
And will Sir John of Hainault lead the round ?
Welcome , a God 's name , madam , and your son ,
England shall welcome you and all your rout .
Gallop apace , bright Phoebus , through the sky ,
And , dusky night , in rusty iron car ,
Between you both shorten the time , I pray ,
That I may see that most desired day
When we may meet these traitors in the field .
Ah , nothing grieves me but my little boy
Is thus misled to countenance their ills .
Come , friends , to Bristol , there to make us strong ;
And , winds , as equal be to bring them in ,
As you injurious were to bear them forth . .
Now lords , our loving friends and countrymen ,
Welcome to England all , with prosperous winds .
Our kindest friends in Belgia have we left ,
To cope with friends at home ; a heavy case
When force to force is knit , and sword and glaive
In civil broils make kin and countrymen
Slaughter themselves in others , and their sides
With their own weapons gored ! But what 's the help ?
Misgoverned kings are cause of all this wrack ;
And , Edward , thou art one among them all
Whose looseness hath betrayed thy land to spoil
And made the channels overflow with blood .
Of thine own people patron shouldst thou be ,
But thou...
Nay , madam , if you be a warrior ,
You must not grow so passionate in speeches .
Lords , sith that we are , by sufferance of heaven ,
Arrived and armed in this prince 's right ,
Here for our country 's cause swear we to him
All homage , fealty , and forwardness ;
And for the open wrongs and injuries
Edward hath done to us , his Queen , and land ,
We come in arms to wreck it with the sword ,
That England 's Queen in peace may repossess
Her dignities and honours ; and withal
We may remove these flatterers from the King
That havoc England 's wealth and treasury .
Sound trumpets , my lord , and forward let us march .
Edward will think we come to flatter him .
I would he never had been flattered more . .
Fly , fly , my lord , the Queen is overstrong ;
Her friends do multiply , and yours do fail .
Shape we our course to Ireland , there to breathe .
What , was I born to fly and run away ,
And leave the Mortimers conquerors behind ?
Give me my horse , and let 's r 'enforce our troops ,
And in this bed of honour die with fame .
O no , my lord , this princely resolution
Fits not the time ; away , we are pursued .
This way he fled , but I am come too late .
Edward , alas , my heart relents for thee .
Proud traitor , Mortimer , why dost thou chase
Thy lawful king , thy sovereign , with thy sword ?
Vild wretch , and why hast thou , of all unkind ,
Borne arms against thy brother and thy king ?
Rain showers of vengeance on my cursed head
Thou God , to whom in justice it belongs
To punish this unnatural revolt .
Edward , this Mortimer aims at thy life .
O , fly him , then ! But , Edmund , calm this rage ;
Dissemble , or thou diest ; for Mortimer
And Isabel do kiss while they conspire ;
And yet she bears a face of love forsooth .
Fie on that love that hatcheth death and hate .
Edmund , away ! Bristol to Longshanks ' blood
Is false ; be not found single for suspect .
Proud Mortimer pries near into thy walks .
Successful battles gives the God of kings
To them that fight in right and fear his wrath .
Since then successfully we have prevailed ,
Thanks be heaven 's great architect , and you .
Ere farther we proceed , my noble lords ,
We here create our well-beloved son ,
Of love and care unto his royal person ,
Lord Warden of the realm , and sith the fates
Have made his father so unfortunate ,
Deal you , my lords , in this , my loving lords ,
As to your wisdoms fittest seems in all .
Madam , without offense if I may ask
How will you deal with Edward in his fall ?
Tell me , good uncle , what Edward do you mean ?
Nephew , your father ; I dare not call him King .
My lord of Kent , what needs these questions ?
' Tis not in her controlment nor in ours ,
But as the realm and parliament shall please ,
So shall your brother be disposed of .
Madam , 'tis good to look to him betimes .
My lord , the mayor of Bristol knows our mind .
Yea , madam ; and they scape not easily
That fled the field .
Baldock is with the King .
A goodly chancellor , is he not , my lord ?
So are the Spencers , the father and the son .
This Edward is the ruin of the realm .
RICE AP HOWELL. God save Queen Isabel and her princely son !
Madam , the mayor and citizens of Bristol ,
In sign of love and duty to this presence ,
Present by me this traitor to the state ,
Spencer , the father to that wanton Spencer ,
That , like the lawless catiline of Rome ,
Revell 'd in England 's wealth and treasury .
We thank you all .
Your loving care in this
Deserveth princely favours and rewards .
But where 's the King and the other Spencer fled ?
RICE AP HOWELL. Spencer the son , created Earl of Gloucester ,
Is with that smooth tongued scholar Baldock gone
And shipped but late for Ireland with the King .
Some whirlwind fetch them back , or sink them all .
They shall be started thence , I doubt it not .
Shall I not see the King my father yet ?
Unhappy 's Edward , chased from England 's bounds .
Madam , what resteth ? Why stand ye in a muse ?
I rue my lord 's ill fortune ; but , alas ,
Care of my country called me to this war !
Madam , have done with care and sad complaint .
Your king hath wronged your country and himself ,
And we must seek to right it as we may .
Meanwhile , have hence this rebel to the block .
Your lordship cannot privilege your head .
SPENCER THE FATHER . Rebel is he that fights against his prince :
So fought not they that fought in Edward 's right .
Take him away ; he prates .
You , Rice ap Howell ,
Shall do good service to her majesty ,
Being of countenance in your country here ,
To follow these rebellious runagates .
We in meanwhile , madam , must take advice ,
How Baldock , Spencer , and their 'complices ,
May in their fall be followed to their end .
Have you no doubt , my lord ; have you no fear .
As silent and as careful will we be
To keep your royal person safe with us ,
Free from suspect , and fell invasion
Of such as have your majesty in chase ,
Yourself , and those your chosen company ,
As danger of this stormy time requires .
Father , thy face should harbour no deceit .
O , hadst thou ever been a king , thy heart ,
Pierced deeply with sense of my distress ,
Could not but take compassion of my state .
Stately and proud in riches and in train ,
Whilom I was powerful and full of pomp .
But what is he whom rule and empery
Have not in life or death made miserable ?
Come , Spencer , Baldock , come , sit down by me ;
Make trial now of that philosophy
That in our famous nurseries of arts
Thou sucked 'st from Plato and from Aristotle .
Father , this life contemplative is heaven .
O that I might this life in quiet lead ,
But we , alas , are chased , and you , my friends ,
Your lives and my dishonour they pursue .
Yet , gentle monks , for treasure , gold , nor fee ,
Do you betray us and our company .
Your grace may sit secure , if none but we
Do wot of your abode .
Not one alive : but shrewdly I suspect
A gloomy fellow in a mead below .
' A gave a long look after us , my lord ;
And all the land , I know , is up in arms ,
Arms that pursue our lives with deadly hate .
We were embarked for Ireland ; wretched we ,
With awkward winds and sore tempests driven
To fall on shore , and here to pine in fear
Of Mortimer and his confederates .
Mortimer ! Who talks of Mortimer ?
Who wounds me with the name of Mortimer ,
That bloody man ? Good father , on thy lap
Lay I this head , laden with mickle care .
O might I never open these eyes again ,
Never again lift up this drooping head ,
O , nevermore lift up this dying heart !
Look up , my lord . Baldock , this drowsiness
Betides no good ; here even we are betrayed .
Upon my life , those be the men ye seek .
RICE AP HOWELL. Fellow , enough . My lord , I pray , be short ;
A fair commission warrants what we do .
The Queen 's commission , urged by Mortimer :
What cannot gallant Mortimer with the Queen ?
Alas , see where he sits , and hopes unseen
T' escape their hands that seek to reave his life .
( Seneca : ' He whom the dawning day has seen exalted in his pride , the departing day has seen downfallen' )
But , Leicester , leave to grow so passionate .
Spencer and Baldock , by no other names ,
I arrest you of high treason here .
Stand not on titles , but obey th ' arrest :
' Tis in the name of Isabel the Queen .
My lord , why droop you thus ?
O day , the last of all my bliss on earth ,
Center of all misfortune ! O my stars ,
Why do you lour unkindly on a king ?
Comes Leicester , then , in Isabella 's name
To take my life , my company from me ?
Here , man , rip up this panting breast of mine ,
And take my heart in rescue of my friends .
RICE AP HOWELL. Away with them !
It may become thee yet
To let us take our farewell of his grace .
My heart with pity earns to see this sight ,
A king to bear these words and proud commands .
Spencer , ah , sweet Spencer , thus , then must we part .
We must , my lord ; so will the angry heavens .
Nay , so will hell and cruel Mortimer ;
The gentle heavens have not to do in this .
My lord , it is in vain to grieve or storm .
Here humbly of your grace we take our leaves .
Our lots are cast ; I fear me , so is thine .
In heaven we may , in earth never shall we meet .
And , Leicester , say , what shall become of us ?
Your majesty must go to Killingworth .
Must ! ' Tis somewhat hard when Kings must go .
Here is a litter ready for your grace ,
That waits your pleasure , and the day grows old .
RICE AP HOWELL. As good be gone , as stay and be benighted .
A litter hast thou ? Lay me in a hearse ,
And to the gates of hell convey me hence .
Let Pluto 's bells ring out my fatal knell ,
And hags howl for my death at Charon 's shore ;
For friends hath Edward none but these , and these ,
And these must die under a tyrant 's sword .
RICE AP HOWELL. My lord , be going : care not for these ;
For we shall see them shorter by the heads .
Well , that shall be , shall be . Part we must .
Sweet Spencer , gentle Baldock , part we must .
Hence , feigned weeds ! Unfeigned are my woes .
Father , farewell . Leicester , thou stay 'st for me ,
And go I must . Life , farewell , with my friends .
O , is he gone ? Is noble Edward gone ,
Parted from hence , never to see us more ?
Rent , sphere of heaven , and , fire , forsake thy orb !
Earth , melt to air ! Gone is my sovereign ,
Gone , gone , alas , never to make return .
Spencer , I see our souls are fleeted hence ;
We are deprived the sunshine of our life .
Make for a new life , man ; throw up thy eyes
And heart and hand to heaven 's immortal throne ;
Pay nature 's debt with cheerful countenance ,
Reduce we all our lessons unto this ,
To die , sweet Spencer , therefore live we all ;
Spencer , all live to die , and rise to fall .
RICE AP HOWELL. Come , come , keep these preachments till you come
to the place appointed . You and such as you are , have
made wise work in England . Will your lordships away ?
Your lordship , I trust , will remember me ?
RICE AP HOWELL. Remember thee , fellow ? What else ? Follow me to the town .
Be patient , good my lord , cease to lament ;
Imagine Killingworth castle were your court ,
And that you lay for pleasure here a space ,
Not of compulsion or necessity .
Leicester , if gentle words might comfort me ,
Thy speeches long ago had eased my sorrows ,
For kind and loving hast thou always been .
The griefs of private men are soon allayed ;
But not of Kings . The forest deer , being struck ,
Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds ;
But when the imperial lion 's flesh is gored ,
He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw ,
And highly scorning that the lowly earth
Should drink his blood , mounts into the air .
And so it fares with me , whose dauntless mind
The ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb ,
And that unnatural Queen , false Isabel ,
That thus hath pent and mewed me in a prison ;
For such outrageous passions cloy my soul ,
As with the wings of rancour and disdain
Full often am I soaring up to heaven ,
To plain me to the gods against them both .
But when I call to mind I am a king ,
Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs ,
That Mortimer and Isabel have done .
But what are kings , when regiment is gone ,
But perfect shadows in a sunshine day ?
My nobles rule ; I bear the name of King ;
I wear the crown ; but am controlled by them ,
By Mortimer , and my unconstant Queen ,
Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy ;
Whilst I am lodged within this cave of care ,
Where sorrow at my elbow still attends ,
To company my heart with sad laments ,
That bleeds within me for this strange exchange .
But tell me , must I now resign my crown ,
To make usurping Mortimer a king ?
Your grace mistakes ; it is for England 's good ,
And princely Edward 's right , we crave the crown .
No, 'tis for Mortimer , not Edward 's head ;
For he 's a lamb , encompassed by wolves ,
Which in a moment will abridge his life .
But , if proud Mortimer do wear this crown ,
Heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire ;
Or , like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon ,
Engirt the temples of his hateful head ;
So shall not England 's vine be perished ,
But Edward 's name survive , though Edward dies .
My lord , why waste you thus the time away ?
They stay your answer ; will you yield your crown ?
Ah , Leicester , weigh how hardly I can brook
To lose my crown and kingdom without cause ,
To give ambitious Mortimer my right ,
That , like a mountain , overwhelms my bliss .
In which extreme my mind here murdered is .
But what the heavens appoint I must obey .
Here , take my crown ; the life of Edward too :
Two kings in England cannot reign at once .
But stay a while . Let me be King till night ,
That I may gaze upon this glittering crown ;
So shall my eyes receive their last content ,
My head , the latest honour due to it ,
And jointly both yield up their wished right .
Continue ever , thou celestial sun ;
Let never silent night possess this clime :
Stand still , you watches of the element ;
All times and seasons , rest you at a stay ,
That Edward may be still fair England 's king .
But day 's bright beams doth vanish fast away ,
And needs I must resign my wished crown .
Inhuman creatures , nursed with tiger 's milk ,
Why gape you for your sovereign 's overthrow ?
My diadem , I mean , and guiltless life .
See , monsters , see ! I 'll wear my crown again .
What , fear you not the fury of your king ?
But , hapless Edward , thou art fondly led ;
They pass not for thy frowns as late they did ,
But seek to make a new elected king ;
Which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts ,
Which thoughts are martyred with endless torments .
And in this torment comfort find I none ,
But that I feel the crown upon my head ;
And therefore let me wear it yet a while .
My lord , the parliament must have present news ,
And therefore say , will you resign or no ?
I 'll not resign , but whilst I live -
Traitors , be gone , and join you with Mortimer .
Elect , conspire , install , do what you will ;
Their blood and yours shall seal these treacheries .
This answer we 'll return ; and so , farewell .
Call them again , my lord , and speak them fair ,
For if they go , the prince shall lose his right .
Call thou them back ; I have no power to speak .
My lord , the King is willing to resign .
If he be not , let him choose .
O would I might , but heavens and earth conspire
To make me miserable . Here , receive my crown .
Receive it ? No, these innocent hands of mine
Shall not be guilty of so foul a crime .
He of you all that most desires my blood
And will be called the murderer of a king ,
Take it . What , are you moved ? Pity you me ?
Then send for unrelenting Mortimer
And Isabel , whose eyes being turned to steel
Will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear .
Yet stay ; for rather than I will look on them ,
Here , here ! Now , sweet God of Heaven ,
Make me despise this transitory pomp ,
And sit for aye enthronized in heaven .
Come , death , and with thy fingers close my eyes ,
Or if I live , let me forget myself .
My lord ...
Call me not lord !
Away , out of my sight ! Ah , pardon me
Grief makes me lunatic .
Let not that Mortimer protect my son ;
More safety is there in a tiger 's jaws
Than his embracements . Bear this to the Queen ,
Wet with my tears , and dried again with sighs .
If with the sight thereof she be not moved ,
Return it back , and dip it in my blood .
Commend me to my son , and bid him rule
Better than I. Yet how have I transgressed ,
Unless it be with too much clemency ?
And thus , most humbly do we take our leave .
Farewell . I know the next news that they bring
Will be my death , and welcome shall it be .
To wretched men death is felicity . .
Another post . What news brings he ?
Such news as I expect . Come , Berkeley , come
And tell thy message to my naked breast .
My lord , think not a thought so villainous
Can harbour in a man of noble birth .
To do your highness service and devoir
And save you from your foes , Berkeley would die .
That I resign my charge .
And who must keep me now ? Must you , my lord ?
Ay , my most gracious lord : so 'tis decreed .
Well may I rent his name that rends my heart ,
This poor revenge hath something eased my mind .
So may his limbs be torn as is this paper ,
Hear me , immortal Jove , and grant it too !
Your grace must hence with me to Berkeley straight .
Whither you will : all places are alike ,
And every earth is fit for burial .
Favour him , my lord , as much as lieth in you .
Even so betide my soul as I use him .
Mine enemy hath pitied my estate ,
And that 's the cause that I am now removed .
And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel ?
I know not , but of this am I assured ,
That death ends all , and I can die but once .
Leicester , farewell .
Not yet , my lord ; I 'll bear you on your way .
Fair Isabel , now have we our desire ;
The proud corrupters of the light-brained king
Have done their homage to the lofty gallows ,
And he himself lies in captivity .
Be ruled by me , and we will rule the realm .
In any case take heed of childish fear ,
For now we hold an old wolf by the ears ,
That , if he slip , will seize upon us both ,
And gripe the sorer , being griped himself .
Think therefore , madam , that imports us much
To erect your son with all the speed we may ,
And that I be protector over him ;
For our behoof will bear the greater sway
Whenas a king 's name shall be under writ .
Sweet Mortimer , the life of Isabel ,
Be thou persuaded that I love thee well ;
And therefore , so the prince my son be safe ,
Whom I esteem as dear as these mine eyes ,
Conclude against his father what thou wilt ,
And I myself will willingly subscribe .
First would I hear news that he were deposed ,
And then let me alone to handle him .
Letters ! From whence ?
From Killingworth , my lord .
How fares my lord the King ?
In health , madam , but full of pensiveness .
Alas , poor soul , would I could ease his grief !
Thanks , gentle Winchester . Sirrah , be gone .
The King hath willingly resigned his crown .
O , happy news ! Send for the prince my son .
Further , or ere this letter was sealed ,
Lord Berkeley came ,
So that he now is gone from Killingworth ;
And we have heard that Edmund laid a plot
To set his brother free ; no more but so .
The lord of Berkeley is so pitiful
As Leicester that had charge of him before .
Then let some other be his guardian .
Let me alone ; here is the privy seal .
Who 's there ? call hither Gurney and Matrevis .
To dash the heavy-headed Edmund 's drift ,
Berkeley shall be discharged , the King removed ,
And none but we shall know where he lieth .
But , Mortimer , as long as he survives ,
What safety rests for us or for my son ?
Speak , shall he presently be dispatched and die ?
I would he were , so it were not by my means .
Enough ! Matrevis , write a letter presently
Unto the lord of Berkeley from ourself
That he resign the King to thee and Gurney ;
And when 'tis done , we will subscribe our name .
It shall be done , my lord .
Gurney .
My lord .
As thou intend 'st to rise by Mortimer ,
Who now makes Fortune 's wheel turn as he please ,
Seek all the means thou canst to make him droop ,
And neither give him kind word nor good look .
I warrant you , my lord .
And this above the rest : because we hear
That Edmund casts to work his liberty ,
Remove him still from place to place by night ,
Till at the last he come to Killingworth ,
And then from thence to Berkeley back again .
And by the way , to make him fret the more ,
Speak curs 'dly to him ; and in any case
Let no man comfort him . If he chance to weep ,
But amplify his grief with bitter words .
Fear not , my lord ; we 'll do as you command .
So , now away ! Post thitherwards amain .
Whither goes this letter ? To my lord the King ?
Commend me humbly to his majesty ,
And tell him that I labour all in vain
To ease his grief and work his liberty ;
And bear him this as witness of my love .
I will , madam .
Finely dissembled ! Do so still , sweet Queen .
Here comes the young prince with the Earl of Kent .
Something he whispers in his childish ears .
If he have such access unto the prince ,
Our plots and stratagems will soon be dashed .
Use Edmund friendly as if all were well .
How fares my honourable Lord of Kent ?
In health , sweet Mortimer . How fares your grace ?
Well , if my lord your brother were enlarged .
I hear of late he hath deposed himself .
The more my grief .
And mine .
Ah , they do dissemble !
Sweet son , come hither ; I must talk with thee .
Thou , being his uncle and the next of blood ,
Do look to be Protector over the prince ?
Not I , my lord . Who should protect the son ,
But she that gave him life - I mean the Queen .
Mother , persuade me not to wear the crown .
Let him be king ; I am too young to reign .
But be content , seeing it is his highness ' pleasure .
Let me but see him first , and then I will .
Ay , do , sweet nephew .
Brother , you know it is impossible .
Why , is he dead ?
No, God forbid !
I would those words proceeded from your heart !
Inconstant Edmund , dost thou favour him ,
That wast a cause of his imprisonment ?
The more cause have I now to make amends .
I tell thee , 'tis not meet that one so false
Should come about the person of a prince .
My lord , he hath betrayed the King his brother ,
And therefore trust him not .
But he repents and sorrows for it now .
Come , son , and go with this gentle lord and me .
With you I will , but not with Mortimer .
Why , youngling , 'sdain 'st thou so of Mortimer ?
Then I will carry thee by force away .
Help , uncle Kent ; Mortimer will wrong me .
Brother Edmund , strive not ; we are his friends .
Isabel is nearer than the Earl of Kent .
Sister , Edward is my charge ; redeem him .
Edward is my son , and I will keep him .
Mortimer shall know that he hath wronged me .
Hence will I haste to Killingworth castle
And rescue aged Edward from his foes ,
To be revenged on Mortimer and thee .
My lord , be not pensive ; we are your friends .
Men are ordained to live in misery .
Therefore , come ; dalliance dangereth our lives .
Friends , whither must unhappy Edward go ?
Will hateful Mortimer appoint no rest ?
Must I be vexed like the nightly bird
Whose sight is loathsome to all winged fowls ?
When will the fury of his mind assuage ?
When will his heart be satisfied with blood ?
If mine will serve , unbowel straight this breast ,
And give my heart to Isabel and him ;
It is the chiefest mark they level at .
Not so , my liege . The Queen hath given this charge
To keep your grace in safety .
Your passions make your dolours to increase .
This usage makes my misery increase .
But can my air of life continue long
When all my senses are annoyed with stench ?
Within a dungeon England 's king is kept ,
Where I am starved for want of sustenance .
My daily diet is heartbreaking sobs ,
That almost rents the closet of my heart .
Thus lives old Edward not relieved by any ,
And so must die , though pitied by many .
O , water , gentle friends , to cool my thirst
And clear my body from foul excrements !
Here 's channel water , as our charge is given .
Sit down , for we 'll be barbers to your grace .
Traitors , away ! What , will you murder me ,
Or choke your sovereign with puddle water ?
No, but wash your face , and shave away your beard ,
Lest you be known , and so be rescued .
Why strive you thus ? Your labour is in vain .
The wren may strive against the lion 's strength ,
But all in vain : so vainly do I strive
To seek for mercy at a tyrant 's hand .
Immortal powers , that know the painful cares
That wait upon my poor distressed soul ,
O level all your looks upon these daring men
That wrong their liege and sovereign , England 's King !
O Gaveston , it is for thee that I am wronged ;
For me both thou and both the Spencers died ,
And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I 'll take .
The Spencers ' ghosts , wherever they remain ,
Wish well to mine ; then tush , for them I 'll die .
' Twixt theirs and yours shall be no enmity .
Come , come , away . Now put the torches out .
We 'll enter in by darkness to Killingworth .
Guard the King sure : it is the Earl of Kent .
O gentle brother , help to rescue me .
Keep them asunder ; thrust in the King .
Soldiers , let me but talk to him one word .
Lay hands upon the Earl for this assault .
Lay down your weapons , traitors ; yield the King .
Edmund , yield thou thyself , or thou shalt die .
Base villains , wherefore do you gripe me thus ?
Bind him , and so convey him to the court .
Where is the court but here ? Here is the King
And I will visit him . Why stay you me ?
The court is where lord Mortimer remains .
Thither shall your honour go ; and so , farewell .
O , miserable is that commonweal , where lords
Keep courts , and Kings are locked in prison !
Wherefore stay we ? On , sirs , to the court .
Ay , lead me whither you will , even to my death ,
Seeing that my brother cannot be released .
The King must die , or Mortimer goes down ;
The commons now begin to pity him .
Yet he that is the cause of Edward 's death
Is sure to pay for it when his son is of age ,
And therefore will I do it cunningly .
This letter , written by a friend of ours ,
Contains his death , yet bids them save his life .
Fear not to kill the King , 'tis good he die .
But read it thus , and that 's another sense :
Kill not the King , 'tis good to fear the worst .
Unpointed as it is , thus shall it go ,
That , being dead , if it chance to be found ,
Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame ,
And we be quit that caused it to be done .
Within this room is locked the messenger
That shall convey it , and perform the rest .
And by a secret token that he bears ,
Shall he be murdered when the deed is done .
Lightborn , come forth !
Art thou so resolute as thou wast ?
What else , my lord ? And far more resolute .
And hast thou cast how to accomplish it ?
Ay , ay , and none shall know which way he died .
But at his looks , Lightborn , thou wilt relent .
Relent ? Ha , ha ! I use much to relent .
Well , do it bravely , and be secret .
You shall not need to give instructions ;
' Tis not the first time I have killed a man :
I learned in Naples how to poison flowers ;
To strangle with a lawn thrust down the throat ;
To pierce the windpipe with a needle 's point ;
Or , whilst one is asleep , to take a quill
And blow a little powder in his ears ;
Or open his mouth , and pour quicksilver down .
But yet I have a braver way than these .
What 's that ?
Nay , you shall pardon me ; none shall know my tricks .
I care not how it is , so it be not spied .
Deliver this to Gurney and Matrevis .
At every ten miles ' end thou hast a horse .
Take this . Away , and never see me more !
No ?
No ; unless thou bring me news of Edward 's death .
That will I quickly do . Farewell , my lord .
The prince I rule , the Queen do I command ,
And with a lowly congee to the ground
The proudest lords salute me as I pass ;
I seal , I cancel , I do what I will .
Feared am I more than loved ; let me be feared ,
And , when I frown , make all the court look pale .
I view the Prince with Aristarchus ' eyes ,
Whose looks were as a breeching to a boy .
They thrust upon me the Protectorship
And sue to me for that that I desire .
While at the council table , grave enough ,
And not unlike a bashful puritan ,
First I complain of imbecility ,
Till , being interrupted by my friends ,
And to conclude , I am protector now .
Now is all sure : the Queen and Mortimer
Shall rule the realm , the king ; and none rule us .
Mine enemies will I plague , my friends advance .
And what I list command who dare control ?
And that this be the coronation day ,
It pleaseth me and Isabel the Queen .
The trumpets sound ; I must go take my place .
Long live King Edward , by the grace of god ,
King of England and Lord of Ireland !
If any Christian , heathen , Turk , or Jew ,
Dares but affirm that Edward 's not true king ,
And will avouch his saying with the sword ,
I am the champion that will combat him .
None comes . Sound , trumpets !
Champion , here 's to thee .
Lord Mortimer , now take him to your charge .
What traitor have we there with blades and bills ?
Edmund , the Earl of Kent .
What hath he done ?
' A would have taken the King away perforce ,
As we were bringing him to Killingworth .
Did you attempt his rescue , Edmund ? Speak .
Mortimer , I did : he is our King ,
And thou compell 'st this prince to wear the crown .
Strike off his head ! He shall have martial law .
Strike off my head ! Base traitor , I defy thee !
My lord , he is my uncle , and shall live .
My lord , he is your enemy , and shall die .
Stay , villains !
Sweet mother , if I cannot pardon him ,
Entreat my Lord Protector for his life .
Son , be content ; I dare not speak a word .
Nor I , and yet methinks I should command ;
But , seeing I cannot , I 'll entreat for him .
My lord , if you will let my uncle live ,
I will requite it when I come to age .
' Tis for your highness ' good , and for the realm 's .
How often shall I bid you bear him hence ?
Art thou King ? Must I die at thy command ?
At our command . Once more away with him .
Let me but stay and speak ; I will not go .
Either my brother or his son is King ,
And none of both them thirst for Edmund 's blood .
And therefore , soldiers , whither will you hale me ?
What safety may I look for at his hands ,
If that my uncle shall be murdered thus ?
Fear not , sweet boy ; I 'll guard thee from thy foes .
Had Edmund lived , he would have sought thy death .
Come , son , we 'll ride a-hunting in the park .
And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us ?
He is a traitor ; think not on him . Come .
Gurney , I wonder the King dies not ,
Being in a vault up to the knees in water ,
To which the channels of the castle run ,
From whence a damp continually ariseth ,
That were enough to poison any man ,
Much more a king brought up so tenderly .
And so do I , Matrevis . Yesternight
I opened but the door to throw him meat ,
And I was almost stifled with the savour .
He hath a body able to endure
More than we can inflict , and therefore now
Let us assail his mind another while .
Send for him out thence , and I will anger him .
But stay , who 's this ?
My Lord Protector greets you .
What 's here ? I know not how to conster it .
Gurney , it was left unpointed for the nonce ;
That 's his meaning .
Know you this token ? I must have the King .
Ay , stay a while ; thou shalt have answer straight .
This villain 's sent to make away the King .
I thought as much .
And when the murder 's done ,
See how he must be handled for his labour .
What else ? Here is the keys , this is the lake .
Do as you are commanded by my lord .
I know what I must do . Get you away ,
Yet be not far off ; I shall need your help .
See that in the next room I have a fire ,
And get me a spit , and let it be red-hot .
Very well .
Need you anything besides ?
What else ? A table and a feather bed .
That 's all ?
Ay , ay : so , when I call you , bring it in .
Fear not you that .
Here 's a light to go into the dungeon .
So , now must I about this gear . Ne 'er was
There any so finely handled as this King shall be .
Foh , here 's a place indeed , with all my heart .
Who 's there ? What light is that ? Wherefore com 'st thou ?
To comfort you and bring you joyful news .
Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks .
Villain , I know thou com 'st to murder me .
To murder you , my most gracious lord ?
Far is it from my heart to do you harm .
The Queen sent me to see how you were used ,
For she relents at this your misery .
And what eyes can refrain from shedding tears
To see a king in this most piteous state ?
Weep'st thou already ? List a while to me ,
And then thy heart , were it as Gurney 's is ,
Or as Matrevis' , hewn from the Caucasus ,
Yet will it melt ere I have done my tale .
This dungeon where they keep me is the sink
Wherein the filth of all the castle falls .
O villains !
And there in mire and puddle have I stood
This ten days ' space ; and , lest that I should sleep ,
One plays continually upon a drum .
They give me bread and water , being a king ;
So that , for want of sleep and sustenance ,
My mind 's distempered , and my body 's numbed ,
And whether I have limbs or no I know not .
O , would my blood dropp 'd out from ev'ry vein ,
As doth this water from my tattered robes .
Tell Isabel , the Queen , I looked not thus ,
When for her sake I ran at tilt in France ,
And there unhorsed the Duke of Cleremont .
O , speak no more , my lord ; this breaks my heart .
Lie on this bed , and rest yourself a while .
These looks of thine can harbour nought but death .
I see my tragedy written in thy brows .
Yet stay a while , forbear thy bloody hand ,
And let me see the stroke before it comes ,
That even then when I shall lose my life ,
My mind may be more steadfast on my God .
What means your highness to mistrust me thus ?
What means thou to dissemble with me thus ?
These hands were never stained with innocent blood ,
Nor shall they now be tainted with a king 's .
Forgive my thought for having such a thought .
One jewel have I left ; receive thou this .
Still fear I , and I know not what 's the cause ,
But every joint shakes as I give it thee .
O , if thou harbour 'st murder in thy heart ,
Let this gift change thy mind , and save thy soul .
Know that I am a king : oh , at that name
I feel a hell of grief ! Where is my crown ?
Gone , gone , and do I remain alive ?
You 're overwatched , my lord ; lie down and rest .
But that grief keeps me waking , I should sleep;
For not these ten days have these eyelids closed .
Now as I speak they fall , and yet with fear
Open again . O wherefore sits thou here ?
If you mistrust me , I 'll be gone , my lord .
No, no , for if thou mean 'st to murder me ,
Thou wilt return again ; and therefore stay .
He sleeps .
O , let me not die yet . Stay , O stay a while !
How now , my lord ?
Something still buzzeth in mine ears
And tells me if I sleep I never wake .
This fear is that which makes me tremble thus ;
And therefore tell me , wherefore art thou come ?
To rid thee of thy life . Matrevis , come .
I am too weak and feeble to resist .
Assist me , sweet God , and receive my soul !
Run for the table .
O spare me , or dispatch me in a trice .
So , lay the table down , and stamp on it ,
But not too hard , lest that you bruise his body .
I fear me that this cry will raise the town ,
And therefore let us take horse and away .
Tell me , sirs , was it not bravely done ?
Excellent well , take this for thy reward
Come , let us cast the body in the moat ,
And bear the King 's to Mortimer our lord .
Is't done , Matrevis , and the murderer dead ?
Ay , my good lord : I would it were undone !
Matrevis , if thou now growest penitent
I 'll be thy ghostly father ; therefore choose ,
Whether thou wilt be secret in this ,
Or else die by the hand of Mortimer .
Gurney , my lord , is fled , and will , I fear ,
Betray us both ; therefore let me fly .
Fly to the savages !
As for myself , I stand as Jove 's huge tree ,
And others are but shrubs compared to me :
All tremble at my name , and I fear none ;
Let 's see who dare impeach me for his death !
Ah , Mortimer , the King my son hath news
His father 's dead , and we have murdered him !
What if we have ? The King is yet a child .
Ay , ay , but he tears his hair , and wrings his hands .
And vows to be revenged upon us both .
Into the council chamber he is gone ,
To crave the aid and succour of his peers .
Ay me , see where he comes , and they with him .
Now , Mortimer , begins our tragedy .
1 LORD. Fear not , my lord ; know that you are a King .
Villain !
How now my lord ?
Think not that I am frighted with thy words .
My father 's murdered through thy treachery ;
And thou shalt die , and on his mournful hearse
Thy hateful and accursed head shall lie
To witness to the world that by thy means
His kingly body was too soon interred .
Weep not , sweet son .
Forbid not me to weep; he was my father ;
And had you loved him half so well as I ,
You could not bear his death thus patiently .
But you , I fear , conspired with Mortimer .
1 LORD. Why speak you not unto my lord the King ?
Because I think scorn to be accused .
Who is the man dares say I murdered him ?
Traitor , in me my loving father speaks ,
And plainly saith , 'twas thou that murdered 'st him .
But hath your grace no other proof than this ?
Yes , if this be the hand of Mortimer .
False Gurney hath betrayed me and himself .
I feared as much ; murder cannot be hid .
' Tis my hand ; what gather you by this ?
That thither thou didst send a murderer .
What murderer ? Bring forth the man I sent .
Ah , Mortimer , thou knowest that he is slain ;
And so shalt thou be too . Why stays he here ?
Bring him unto a hurdle , drag him forth ;
Hang him , I say , and set his quarters up ,
And bring his head back presently to me .
For my sake , sweet son , pity Mortimer !
Madam , entreat not . I will rather die
Than sue for life unto a paltry boy .
Hence with the traitor , with the murderer !
Base Fortune , now I see , that in thy wheel
There is a point , to which when men aspire ,
They tumble headlong down . That point I touched ,
And , seeing there was no place to mount up higher ,
Why should I grieve at my declining fall ?
Farewell , fair Queen , weep not for Mortimer ,
That scorns the world and , as a traveller ,
Goes to discover countries yet unknown .
What ! Suffer you the traitor to delay ?
As thou received 'st thy life from me ,
Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer .
This argues that you spilt my father 's blood ,
Else would you not entreat for Mortimer .
I spill his blood ? No!
Ay , madam , you , for so the rumour runs .
That rumour is untrue : for loving thee ,
Is this report raised on poor Isabel .
I do not think her so unnatural .
My lord , I fear me it will prove too true .
Mother , you are suspected for his death ,
And therefore we commit you to the Tower
Till further trial may be made thereof .
If you be guilty , though I be your son ,
Think not to find me slack or pitiful .
Nay , to my death , for too long have I lived ,
Whenas my son thinks to abridge my days .
Away with her ! Her words enforce these tears ,
And I shall pity her if she speak again .
Shall I not mourn for my beloved lord ,
And with the rest accompany him to his grave ?
Thus , madam , 'tis the King 's will you shall hence .
He hath forgotten me , stay , I am his mother .
That boots not ; therefore , gentle madam , go .
Then come , sweet death , and rid me of this grief .
