My lords ,
Know that we , far from any natural pride ,
Or touch of temporal sway , have seen our face
In our grave council 's foreheads , where doth stand
Our truest glass , made by time 's wrinkled hand .
We know we 're old ; my days proclaim me so .
Forty-five years I 've gently ruled this dukedom ;
Pray heaven it be no fault ,
For there 's as much disease , though not to th ' eye ,
In too much pity as in tyranny .
Your grace hath spoke it right .
I know that life
Has not long course in me ; 'twill not be long
Before I show that kings have mortal bodies
As well as subjects . Therefore , to my comfort ,
And your successful hopes , I have a son
Whom I dare boast of--
Whom we all do boast of ;
A prince elder in virtues than in years .
His judgment is a father to his youth .
Ay , ay , would he were from court !
Our largest hopes grow in him .
And 'tis the greatest pity , noble lord ,
He is untraveled .
' Tis Indeed , my lord .
Had he but travel to his time and virtue--
Oh , he should ne 'er return again !
It shall be so : what is in hope begun
Experience quickens ; travel confirms the man ,
Who else lives doubtful , and his days oft sorry ;
Who 's rich in knowledge has the stock of glory .
Most true , my royal lord .
Someone attend our son .
See , here he comes , my lord .
Oh , you come well .
' Tis always my desire , my worthy father .
Your serious studies , and those fruitful hours
That grow up into judgment , well become
Your birth , and all our loves ; I weep that you are my son ,
But virtuously I weep , the more my gladness .
We have thought good and meet by the consent
Of these our nobles , to move you toward travel ,
The better to approve you to yourself ,
And give your apter power foundation :
To see affections actually presented ,
E'en by those men that owe them , yields more profit ,
Ay , more content , than singly to read of them ,
Since love or fear make writers partial .
The good and free example which you find
In other countries , match it with your own ,
The ill to shame the ill , which will in time
Fully instruct you how to set in frame
A kingdom all in pieces .
Honour 'd father ,
With care and duty I have listened to you .
What you desire , in me it is obedience :
I do obey in all , knowing for right ,
Experience is a kingdom 's better sight .
Oh , 'tis the very luster of a prince .
Travel ! ' Tis sweet and generous .
He that knows how to obey , knows how to reign ;
And that true knowledge have we found in you .
Make choice of your attendants .
They 're soon chose ;
Only this man , my lord , a loving servant of mine .
What , none but he ?
I do entreat no more ;
For that 's the benefit a private gentleman
Enjoys beyond our state , when he notes all ,
Himself unnoted .
For , should I bear the fashion of a prince ,
I should then win more flattery than profit ;
And I should give 'em time and warning then
To hide their actions from me : if I appear a sun ,
They 'll run into the shade with their ill deeds ,
And so prevent me .
A little too wise , a little too wise to live long .
You have answered us with wisdom : let it be .
Things private are best known through privacy .
Stay you , my elected servant .
My kind lord .
The duke my father has a heavy burden
Of years upon him .
My lord , it seems so , for they make him stoop .
Without dissemblance he is deep in age ;
He bows unto his grave . I wonder much
Which of his wild nobility it should be--
For none of his sad council has a voice in't--
Should so far travel into his consent
To set me over into other kingdoms
Upon the stroke and minute of his death ?
My lord , 'tis easier to suspect them all ,
Than truly to name one .
Since it is thus ,
By absence I 'll obey the duke my father
And yet not wrong myself .
Therein , my lord ,
You might be happy twice .
So it shall be ;
I 'll stay at home and travel .
Would your grace
Could make that good !
I can . And indeed a prince need not travel farther than his
own kingdom , if he apply himself faithfully , worthy the glory
of himself and expectation of others . And it would appear far
nobler industry in him to reform those fashions that are already
in his country than to bring new ones in which have neither true
form nor fashion ; to make his court an owl , city an ape , and the
country a wolf preying upon the ridiculous pride of either . And
therefore I hold it a safer stern upon this lucky advantage , since
my father is near his setting , and I upon the eastern hill to
take my rise , to look into the heart and bowels of this dukedom ,
and in disguise mark all abuses ready for reformation or punishment .
Give me but leave unfeignedly to admire you ,
Your wisdom is so spacious and so honest .
So much have the complaints and suits of men seven , nay , seventeen
years neglected , still interposed by coin and great enemies , prevailed
with my pity that I cannot otherwise think but there are infectious
dealings to most offices , and foul mysteries throughout all professions .
And therefore I nothing doubt but to find travel enough within
myself , and experience , I fear , too much . Nor will I be curious
to fit my body to the humblest form and bearing , so the labour
may be fruitful : for how can abuses that keep low come to the
right view of a prince unless his looks lie level with them , which
else will be longest hid from him , he shall be the last man sees
'em .
For oft between king 's eyes and subjects ' crimes
Stands there a bar of bribes ; the under office
Flatters him next above it , he the next ,
And so of most , or many .
Every abuse will choose a brother :
' Tis through the world , this hand will rub the other .
You have set down the world briefly , my lord .
But how am I assur 'd of faith in thee ?
Yet I durst trust thee .
Let my soul be lost
When it shall loose your secrets . Nor will I
Only be a preserver of them , but ,
If you so please , an assister .
It suffices .
That king stands sur 'st who by his virtues rises
More than by birth or blood ; that prince is rare
Who strives in youth to save his age from care .
Let 's be prepar 'd . Away !
I 'll follow your grace .
Thou wonder of all princes , president , and glory ,
True phoenix , made of an unusual strain !
Who labours to reform is fit to reign .
How can that king be safe that studies not
The profit of his people ? See where comes
The best part of my heart , my love .
Sir , I am bound to find you ; I heard newly
Of sudden travel which his grace intends ,
And only but yourself to accompany him .
You heard in that little beside the truth ;
Yet not so sudden as to want those manners
To leave you unregarded .
I did not think so unfashionably of you .
How long is your return ?
' Tis not yet come to me , scarce to my lord ,
Unless the duke refer it to his pleasure ;
But long I think it is not : the duke 's age ,
If not his apt experience , will forbid it .
His grace commands , I must not think amiss .
Farewell .
Nay , stay , and take this comfort :
You shall hear often from us , I 'll direct
Where you shall surely know ; and I desire you
Write me the truth , how my new father-in-law
The captain bears himself toward my mother ;
For that marriage knew nothing of my mind ,
It never flourish 'd in any part of my affection .
Methinks she 's much disgrac 'd herself .
Nothing so ,
If he be good , and will abide the touch ;
A captain may marry a lady , if he can sail
Into her good will .
Indeed , that 's all .
' Tis all
In all . Commend me to thy breast ; farewell .
So by my lord 's firm policy we may see ,
To present view , what absent forms would be .
There 's noble purchase , Captain !
Nay , admirable purchase .
Enough to make us proud forever .
Hah ?
Never was opportunity so gallant .
Why , you make me mad !
Three ships , not a poop less .
And every one so wealthily burdened , upon my manhood .
Pox on't , and now am I tied e 'en as the devil would ha't .
Captain , of all men living , I would ha' sworn thou would 'st ne 'er
have married .
'Sfoot , so would I myself , man . Give me my due ; you know I ha'
sworn all heaven over and over ?
That you have , i'faith .
Why , go to , then .
Of a man that has tasted salt water to commit such a fresh trick !
Why , 'tis abominable , I grant you , now I see 't !
Had there been fewer women--
And among those women fewer drabs--
And among those drabs fewer pleasing--
Then 't 'ad been something .
But when there are more women , more common , pretty sweethearts ,
than ever any age could boast of--
And I to play the artificer and marry : to have my wife dance at
home , and my ship at sea , and both take in salt water together !
Oh , lieutenant , thou'rt happy , thou keep'st a wench .
I hope I am happier than so , Captain , for o ' my troth , she keeps
me .
How ? Is there any such fortunate man breathing ? And I so miserable
to live honest ! I envy thee , lieutenant , I envy thee , that thou
art such a happy knave . Here 's my hand among you , share it equally : I 'll
to sea with you .
There spoke a noble captain !
Let 's hear from you ; there will be news shortly .
Doubt it not , Captain .
What lustful passion came aboard of me that I should marry ; was
I drunk ? Yet that cannot altogether hold , for it was four o'clock
i' th ' morning ; had it been five , I would ha' sworn it . That
a man is in danger every minute to be cast away , without he have
an extraordinary pilot that can perform more than a man can do !
And to say truth , too , when I 'm abroad , what can I do at home ?
No man living can reach so far . And what a horrible thing 'twould
be to have horns brought me at sea , to look as if the devil were
i' th ' ship ! And all the great tempests would be thought of my
raising : to be the general curse of all merchants ! And yet they
likely are as deep in as myself , and that 's a comfort . Oh , that
a captain should live to be married ! Nay , I that have been such
a gallant salt-thief should yet live to be married . What a fortunate
elder brother is he , whose father being a rammish plowman , himself
a perfumed gentleman spending the labouring reek from his father 's
nostrils in tobacco , the sweat of his father 's body in monthly
physic for his pretty , queasy harlot . He sows apace , i' th ' country ;
the tailor o 'ertakes him i' th ' city , so that oftentimes before
the corn comes to earing , 'tis up to the ears in high collars ,
and so at every harvest the reapers take pains for the mercers :
ha ! why this is stirring happiness indeed . Would my father had
held a plow so , and fed upon squeez 'd curds and onions , that I
might have bath 'd in sensuality ! But he was too ruttish himself
to let me thrive under him , consumed me before he got me , and
that makes me so wretched now to be shackled with a wife , and
not greatly rich , neither .
Captain , my husband .
' Slife , call me husband again and I 'll play the captain and beat
you .
What has disturb 'd you , sir , that you now look
So like an enemy upon me ?
Go make a widower , hang thyself !
How comes it that you are so opposite
To love and kindness ? I deserve more respect ,
But that you please to be forgetful of it .
For love to you did I neglect my state ,
Chide better fortunes from me ,
Gave the world talk , laid all my friends at waste .
The more fool you . Could you like none but me ?
Could none but I supply you ? I am sure
You were sued by far worthier men ,
Deeper in wealth and gentry .
What could 'st thou see in me , to make thee dote
So on me ? If I know I am a villain ,
What a torment 's this ! Why didst thou marry me ?
You think , as most of your insatiate widows ,
That captains can do wonders , when 'las ,
The name does often prove the better man .
That which you urge should rather give me cause
To repent than yourself .
Then to that end
I do 't .
What a miserable state
Am I led into !
How now , sir ?
Count Proditor
Is now alighted .
What , my lord ? I must
Make much of him , he 'll one day write me cuckold ;
' Tis good to make much of such a man :
E'en to my face he plies it hard . I thank him .
What , my worthy lord ?
I 'll come to you
In order , Captain .
Oh , that 's in order !
A kiss is the gamut to pricksong .
Let me salute you , Captain .
My dear
Esteemed count , I have a life for you .
Hear you the news ?
What may it be , my lord ?
My lord , the duke 's son , is upon his travel
To several kingdoms .
May it be possible , my lord ,
And yet so little rumour 'd ?
Take 't of my truth ;
Nay , 'twas well manag 'd , things are as they are handl 'd :
But all my care is still , pray heaven he return
Safe , without danger , Captain .
Why , is there
Any doubt to be had of that , my lord ?
Ay , by my faith , Captain :
Princes have private enemies , and great .
Put case a man should grudge him for his virtues ,
Or envy him for his wisdom ; why , you know ,
This makes him lie barebreasted to his foe .
That 's full of certainty , my lord ; but who
Be his attendants ?
Thence , Captain , comes the fear ;
But singly attended , my best gladness--
Only by your son-in-law , Fidelio .
Is it to be believ 'd ? I promise you , my lord , then I begin to
fear him myself ; that fellow will undo him . I durst undertake
to corrupt him with twelvepence over and above , and that 's a small
matter ; h'as a whorish conscience ; he 's an inseparable knave ,
and I could ne 'er speak well of that fellow .
All we of the younger house , I can tell you , do doubt him much .
The lady 's remov 'd : shall we have your sweet society , Captain ?
Though it be in mine own house , I desire
I may follow your lordship .
I love to avoid strife ;
Not many months Phoenix shall keep his life .
So , his way is in ; he knows it .
We must not be uncourteous to a lord ;
Warn him our house , 'twere vild . His presence is
An honour . If he lie with our wives , 'tis for
Our credit ; we shall be the better trusted :
' Tis a sign we shall live i' th ' world . Oh , tempests and whirlwinds !
Who but that man whom the forefinger cannot daunt , that makes
his shame his living , who but that man , I say , could endure to
be throughly married ? Nothing but a divorce can relieve me : any
way to be rid of her would rid my torment . If all means fall ,
I 'll kill or poison her and purge my fault at sea . But first
I 'll make gentle try of a divorce : but how shall I accuse her
subtle honesty ? I 'll attach this lord 's coming to her , take hold
of that , ask counsel : and now I remember , I have acquaintance
with an old , crafty client , who , by the puzzle of suits and shifting
of courts , has more tricks and starting-holes than the dizzy pates
of fifteen attorneys ; one that has been muzzled in law like a
bear , and led by the ring of his spectacles from office to office :
Him I 'll seek out with haste ; all paths I 'll tread ,
All deaths I 'll die , ere I die married .
Puh , you do resist me hardly .
I beseech your lordship , cease in this ; 'tis never to be granted .
If you come as a friend unto my honour and my husband , you shall
be ever welcome ; if not , I must entreat it--
Why , assure yourself , madam , 'tis not the fashion .
' Tis more my grief , my lord ; such as myself
Are judg 'd the worse for such .
Faith , you 're too nice :
You 'll see me kindly forth ?
And honourably welcome .
Gentlemen , you 're most neatly welcome .
You 're very cleanly , sir ; prithee , have a care to our geldings .
Your geldings shall be well considered .
Considered ?
Sirrah , what guests does this inn hold now ?
Some five and twenty gentlemen , besides their beasts .
Their beasts ?
Their wenches , I mean , sir ; for your worship knows that those
that are under men are beasts .
How does your mother , sir ?
Very well in health , I thank you heartily , sir .
And so is my mare , i'faith .
I 'll do her commendations indeed , sir .
Well kept up , shuttlecock !
But what old fellow was he that newly alighted before us ?
Who , he ? As arrant a crafty fellow as e 'er made water on horseback :
some say he 's as good as a lawyer ; marry , I 'm sure he 's as bad
as a knave . If you have any suits in law , he 's the fittest man
for your company ; he 's been so towed and lugg 'd himself that
he is able to afford you more knavish counsel for ten groats than
another for ten shillings .
A fine fellow ! But do you know him to be a knave , and will lodge
him ?
Your worship begins to talk idly ; your bed shall be made presently :
if we should not lodge knaves , I wonder how we should be able
to live honestly . Are there honest men enough , think you , in
a term-time to fill all the inns in the town ? And , as far as
I can see , a knave 's gelding eats no more hay than an honest man 's ;
nay , a thief 's gelding eats less , I 'll stand to't , his master
allows him a better ordinary . Yet I have my eightpence , day and
night . ' Twere more for our profit , I wus , you were all thieves ,
if you were so contented . I shall be called for : give your worships
good morrow .
A royal knave , i'faith . We have happened into a godly inn .
Assure you , my lord , they belong all to one church .
This should be some old , busy , turbulent fellow : villainous law-worn ,
that eats holes into poor men 's causes .
May it please your worship to give me leave ?
TANGLE
I give you leave , sir : you have your Now fill
me a brown toast , sirrah .
Will you have no drink to't , sir ?
Is that a question in law ?
Yes , in the lowest court , i' th ' cellar , sir .
Let me ha't remov 'd presently , sir .
It shall be done , sir .
Now as you were saying , sir . I 'll come to you immediately , too .
Oh , very well , sir .
I 'm a little busy , sir .
But as how , sir ?
I pray , sir ?
He 's brought me into the court ; marry , my adversary has not declared
it .
sayst thou ? What a villain 's
that ! I have a trick to do thee good : I will get thee out a proxy ,
and make him declare , with a pox to him .
That will make him declare , to his sore grief ; I thank your good
worship . But put case he do declare ?
if he should declare there--
I would be loath to stand out to the judgment of that court .
Do you fear corruption ? Then
I 'll relieve you again . You shall get a
and remove it higher .
Very good .
Now if it should ever come to a what be
his witnesses ?
I little fear his witnesses .
TANGLE
More valiant man than Orestes !
Please you , sir , to dissolve this into wine , ale , or beer . I come a hundred mile to you , I protest , and leave
all other counsel behind me .
Nay , you shall always find me a sound card ; I stood not a' th '
pillory for nothing in eighty-eight , all the world knows that .
Now let me dispatch you , sir : I come to you , presenter .
Has he that knavery ? But has he put in bail above , canst tell ?
That , I can assure your worship , he has not .
Why , then , thy best course shall be to lay out more money , take
out a and bring down the cause and him with
a vengeance .
Then he will come indeed .
As for the other party , let the alone ; take
me out a special which will cost you enough ,
utlagatem</A> for your execution .
I thank you , my learned counsel .
What a busy caterpillar 's this ! Let 's accost
him in that manner .
Content , my lord .
Oh , my old admirable fellow , how have I all this while thirsted
to salute thee ! I knew thee in of the duke--
In of the duke ? I remember the year well .
By th ' mass , a lusty , proper man !
Oh , was I ?
But still in law .
Still in law ? I had not breath 'd else now ; 'tis very marrow ,
very manna to me to be in law : I 'd been dead ere this else .
I have found such sweet pleasure in the vexation of others that
I could wish my years over and over again , to see that fellow
a beggar , that bawling knave a gentleman , a matter brought e 'en
to a judgment today , as far as e 'er 'twas to begin again tomorrow .
Oh , raptures ! Here a writ of demur , there a
money-laws !
Is it possible , old lad ?
I have been a term-trotter myself any time this five and forty
years : a goodly time and a gracious : in which space I ha' been
at least sixteen times beggar 'd , and got up again ; and in the
mire again , that I have stunk again , and yet got up again .
And so clean and handsome now ?
You see it apparently ; I cannot hide it from you . Nay , more ,
be it spoken , you see i' me old , yet have
I at this present nine and twenty suits in law .
Deliver us , man !
And all not worth forty shillings .
May it be believ 'd ?
The pleasure of a man is all .
An old fellow , and such a stinger !
A stake pull 'd out of my hedge , there 's one ; I was well beaten ,
I remember , that 's two ; I took one abed with my wife again her
will , that 's three ; I was call 'd cuckold for my labor , that 's
four ; I took another bed again , that 's five ; then one called me
wittol , that 's six ; he kill 'd my dog for barking , seven ; my maidservant
was knock 'd at that time , eight ; my wife miscarried with a push ,
nine ; and I have so vex 'd and beggar 'd
the whole parish with process , subpoenas , and suchlike molestations ,
they are not able to spare so much ready money from a term as
would set up a new weathercock ; the churchwardens are fain to
go to law with the poor 's money .
Fie , fie !
And I so fetch up all the men every term-time , that 'tis impossible
to be at civil cuckoldry within ourselves , unless the whole country
rise upon our wives .
O 'my faith , a pretty policy !
PHOENIX
Nay , an excellent stratagem . But of all , I most wonder at the
continual substance of thy wit , that , having had so many suits
in law from time to time , thou has still money to relieve 'em .
He 's the best fortune for that ; I never knew him without .
Why do you so much wonder at that ? Why , this is my course : my
mare and I come up some five days before a term .
A good decorum .
Here I lodge , as you see , amongst inns and places of most
receipt--
Very wittily .
By which advantage I dive into countrymen 's causes ; furnish 'em
with knavish counsel , little to their profit ; buzzing into their
ears this course , that writ , this office , that
you know , I have words enow for the purpose .
Enow i' conscience , i'faith .
Enow i' law , no matter for conscience . For which busy and laborious
sweating courtesy they cannot choose but feed me with money , by
which I maintain mine own suits . Ho , ho , ho!
Why , let me hug thee ; caper in mine arms .
Another special trick I have , nobody must know it , which is to
prefer most of those men to one attorney whom I affect best , to
answer which kindness of mine he will sweat the better in my cause
and do them the less good ; take 't of my word , I help 'd my attorney
to more clients the last term than he will dispatch all his lifetime : I
did it !
What a noble , memorable deed was there !
Sir .
Now , sir ?
There 's a kind of captain very robustiously inquires for you .
For me ? A man of war ? A man of law is fit for a man of war :
we have no leisure to say prayers ; we both kill o ' Sunday mornings .
I 'll not be long from your sweet company .
Oh , no , I beseech you .
What captain might this be ?
Thou angel sent amongst us , sober Law ,
Made with meek eyes , persuading action ,
No loud , immodest tongue ,
Voic 'd like a virgin , and as chaste from sale ,
Save only to be heard , but not to rail ;
How has abuse deform 'd thee to all eyes ,
That where thy virtues sat , thy vices rise ?
Yet why so rashly , for one villain 's fault ,
Do I arraign whole man ? Admired Law ,
Thy upper parts must need be sacred , pure ,
And incorruptible ; they 're grave and wise :
' Tis but the dross beneath 'em , and the clouds
That get between thy glory and their praise ,
That make the visible and foul eclipse ;
For those that are near to thee are upright ,
As noble in their conscience as their birth ;
Know that damnation is in every bribe ,
And rarely put it from 'em ; rate the presenters ,
And scourge 'em with five years ' imprisonment ,
For offering but to tempt 'em .
This is true justice exercis 'd and us 'd :
Woe to the giver when the bribe 's refus 'd !
' Tis not their will to have law worse than war ,
Where still the poor 'st die first ;
To send a man without a sheet to his grave ,
Or bury him in his papers .
' Tis not their mind it should be , nor to have
A suit hang longer than a man in chains ,
Let him be ne 'er so fasten 'd . They least know
That are above the tedious steps below :
I thank my time , I do .
I long to know what captain this should be .
See where the bane of every cause returns .
'Sfoot , 'tis the Captain , my father-in-law , my lord !
Take heed .
The divorce shall rest then , and the five hundred crowns shall
stand in full force and virtue .
Then do you wisely , Captain .
Away sail I ; fare thee well .
A lusty crack of wind go with thee .
But ah!--
Hah ?
Remember , a scrivener .
I 'll have him for thee .
Why , thus am I sought after by all professions . Here 's a weatherbeaten
captain , who , not long since new married to a lady widow , would
now fain have sued a divorce between her and him , but that her
honesty is his only hindrance : to be rid of which , he does determine
to turn her into white money ; and there 's a lord , his chapman ,
has bid five hundred crowns for her already .
How ?
Or for his part , or whole , in her .
Why , does he mean to sell his wife ?
His wife ? Ay , by th ' mass , he would sell his soul if he knew
what merchant would lay out money upon't ; and some of 'em have
need of one , they swear so fast .
Why , I never heard of the like .
didst ne 'er hear of that trick ? Why , Pistor ,
a baker , sold his wife t 'other day to a cheesemonger , that made
cake and cheese ; nother to a cofferer ; a third to a common player :
why , you see 'tis common . Ne 'er fear the Captain ; he has not
so much wit to be a precedent himself . I promis 'd to furnish
him with an odd scrivener of mine own , to draw the bargain and
sale of his lady . Your horses stored here , gentlemen ?
Ay , ay , ay .
I shall be busily plung 'd till towards bedtime above the chin
What monstrous days are these !
Not only to be vicious most men study ,
But in it to be ugly ; strive to exceed
Each other in the most deformed deed .
Was this her private choice ? Did she neglect
The presence and opinion of her friends
For this ?
I wonder who that one should be ,
Should so disgrace that reverend name of lord
So loathsomely to buy adultery ?
We may make means to know .
Take courage , man ; we 'll beget some defense .
I am bound by nature .
I by conscience .
To sell his lady ! Indeed , she was a beast
To marry him , and so he makes of her .
Come , I 'm thorough now I 'm entered .
JEWELLER 'S WIFE
Is my sweet knight coming ? Are you certain he 's coming ?
Certain , forsooth ; I am sure I saw him out of the barber 's shop
window ere I would come away .
A barber 's shop ? Oh , he 's a trim knight ! Would he venture his
body into a barber 's shop , when he knows 'tis as dangerous as
a piece of Ireland ? Oh , yonder , yonder , he comes ! Get you back
again , and look you say as I advis 'd you .
You know me , mistress !
My mask , my mask !
My sweet Revenue !
My Pleasure , welcome ! I have got single ; none but you shall accompany
me to the justice of peace , my father 's .
Why , is thy father justice of peace , and I not know it ?
My father ? I'faith , sir , ay ; simply though I stand here a citizen 's
wife , I am a justice of peace 's daughter .
I love thee the better for thy birth .
Is that your lackey yonder , in the steaks of velvet ?
KNIGHT
He 's at thy service , my sweet Revenue , for thy money paid for
'em .
Why , then , let him run a little before , I beseech thee , for o 'my
troth , he will discover us else .
He shall obey thee : before , sirrah , trudge .
But do you mean to lie at your father 's all night ?
Why should I desire your company else ?
'Sfoot , where shall I lie , then ?
What an idle question 's that ? Why , do you think I cannot make
room for you in my father 's house as well as in my husband 's ?
They 're both good for nothing else .
A man so resolute in valour as a woman in desire were an absolute
leader !
May it please your good worship , master justice--
Please me and please yourself ; that 's my word .
FIRST SUITOR
The party your worship sent for will by no means be brought to
appear .
He will not ? Then what would you advise me to do therein ?
Only to grant your worship 's warrant , which is of sufficient force
to compel him .
No, by my faith ! You shall not have me in that trap : am I sworn
justice of peace , and shall I give my warrant to fetch a man against
his will ? Why , there the peace is broken . We must do all quietly ;
if he come he 's welcome , and , as far as I can see yet , he 's a
fool to be absent ; ay , by this gold is which
he gave me this morning .
Why , but may it please your good worship--
I say again , please me and please yourself ; that 's my word still .
Sir , the world esteems it a common favour , upon the contempt of
the party , the justice to grant his warrant .
Ay , 'tis so common , 'tis the worse again ; 'twere the better for
me 'twere otherwise .
I protest , sir , and this gentleman can say as much , it lies upon
my half undoing .
I cannot see yet that it should be so ; I see not a cross yet .
I beseech your worship show me your immediate favour , and accept
this small trifle but as a remembrance to my succeeding thankfulness .
Angels ? I 'll not meddle with them ; you give 'em to my wife , not
to me .
Ay , ay , sir .
But , I pray , tell me now , did the party with
his own mouth , deliver that contempt , that he would not appear ,
or did you but jest in't ?
Jest ? No, o ' my troth , sir , such was his insolent answer .
And do you think it stood with my credit to put up such an abuse ?
Will he not appear , says he ? I 'll make him appear with a vengeance .
Latronello!
Does your worship call ?
Draw me a strong-limb 'd warrant for the gentleman speedily ; he
will be bountiful to thee . Go and thank him within .
I shall know your worship hereafter .
Ay , ay , prithee do . Two angels one party , four another : and I
think it a great spark of wisdom and policy , if a man come to
me for justice , first to know his griefs by his fees , which be
light and which be heavy ; he may counterfeit else , and make me
do justice for nothing . I like not that , for when I mean to be
just , let me be paid well for't : the deed so rare purges the bribe .
How now , what 's the news , thou art come so hastily ? How fares
my knightly brother ?
Troth , he ne 'er fared worse in his life , sir ; he ne 'er had less
stomach to his meat since I knew him .
Why , sir ?
Indeed , he 's dead , sir .
How , sir ?
Newly deceas 'd , I can assure your worship : the tobacco-pipe new
dropp 'd out of his mouth before I took horse , a shrewd sign ; I
knew then there was no way but one with him . The poor pipe was
the last man he took leave of in this world , who fell in three
pieces before him and seem 'd to mourn inwardly , for it look 'd
as black i' th ' mouth as my master .
Would he die so like a politician , and not once write his mind
to me ?
No, I 'll say that for him , sir ; he died in the perfect state of
memory , made your worship his full and whole executor , bequeathing
his daughter and with her all his wealth only to your disposition .
Did he make such a godly end , sayest thou ? Did he die so comfortably ,
and bequeath all to me ?
Your niece is at hand , sir , the will , and the witnesses .
What a precious joy and comfort 's this , that a justice 's brother
can die so well , nay , in such a good and happy memory , to make
me full executor . Well , he was too honest to live , and that made
him die so soon . Now , I beshrew my heart , I am glad he 's in heaven ;
he 's left all his cares and troubles with me , and that great vexation
of telling of money : yet I hope he had so much grace to turn his
white money into gold , a great ease to his executor .
See , here comes your niece , my young mistress , sir .
Ah , my sweet niece , let me kiss thee and drop a tear between thy
lips ! One tear from an old man is a great matter ; the cooks of
age are dry . Thou hast lost a virtuous father , to gain a notable
uncle .
My hopes now rest in you next under heaven .
Let 'em rest , let 'em rest .
Sir--
You 're most welcome ere ye begin , sir .
We are both led by oath and dreadful promise
Made to the dying man at his last sense ,
First to deliver these into your hands ,
The sureties and revealers of his state--
Good .
With this his only daughter and your niece ,
Whose fortunes are at your disposing set ;
Uncle and father are in you both met .
Good , i'faith , a wellspoken gentleman ; you 're not an esquire ,
sir ?
Not , sir .
Not , sir ? More 's the pity ; by my faith , better men than you are ,
but a great many worse : you see I have been a scholar in my time ,
though I 'm a justice now . Niece , you 're most happily welcome ;
the charge of you is wholly and solely mine own : and since you
are so fortunately come , Niece , I 'll rest a perpetual widower .
I take the meaning chaster than the words ;
Yet I hope well of both , since it is thus ,
His phrase offends least that 's known humourous .
I make my brother , " says he , "full
and whole executor " : honestly done of him , i'faith ! Seldom
can a man get such a brother . And here again , says he , very virtuously ,
" I bequeath all to him and his disposing" : an excellent
fellow , o ' my troth , would you might all die no worse , gentlemen !
But as much better as might be .
Bless your uprightness , master justice !
You 're most soberly welcome , sir . Daughter , you 've that ye kneel
for ; rise , salute your weeping cousin .
Weeping , cousin ?
Eye to weeping is very proper , and so is the party
that spake it , believe me , a pretty , fine , slender , straight ,
delicate-knit body .
Oh , how it moves a pleasure through our senses !
How small are women 's waists to their expenses !
I cannot see her face , that 's under water yet .
News as cold to the heart as an old man 's kindness : my uncle dead !
NIECE
I have lost the dearest father !
" If she marry by your consent ,
choice and liking , make her dowry five thousand
hum , five thousand crowns ? Therefore by my consent she shall
ne 'er marry ; I will neither choose for her , like of it , nor consent
to't .
Now , by the pleasure of my blood , a pretty cousin !
I would not care if I were as near kin to her as I have been
to her kinswoman .
Daughter , what gentleman might this be ?
No gentleman , sir , he 's a knight .
Is he but a knight ? Troth , I would a' sworn he 'd been a gentleman ,
to see , to see , to see .
He 's my husband 's own brother , I can tell you , sir .
Thy husband 's brother ? Speak certainly , prithee .
I can assure you , father , my husband and he have lain both in
one belly .
I 'll swear then he is his brother indeed , and by the surer side .
I crave hearty pardon , sweet kinsman , that thou hast stood so
long unsaluted in the way of kindred .
Welcome to my board ; I have a bed for thee .
My daughter 's husband 's brother shall command
Keys of my chests and chambers .
I have stable for thy horse , chamber for thyself , and a loft above
for thy lousy lackey :
All sit , away with handkerchers , dry up eyes ;
At funeral we must cry ; now let 's be wise .
I told you his affection .
KNIGHT
It falls sweetly .
But here I bar you from all plots tonight ;
The time is yet too heavy to be light .
Why , I 'm content ; I 'll sleep as chaste as you ,
And wager night by night who keeps most true .
Well , we shall see your temper .
Fear not me , Fidelio ; become you that invisible rope-maker , the
scrivener , that binds a man as he walks , yet all his joints at
liberty , as well as I 'll fit that common folly of gentry , the
easy-affecting venturer , and no doubt our purpose will arrive
most happily .
Chaste duty , my lord , works powerfully in me ; and rather than
the poor lady my mother should fall upon the common side of rumour
to beggar her name , I would not only undergo all habits , offices ,
disguis 'd professions , though e 'en opposite to the temper my blood
holds , but , in the stainless quarrel of her reputation , alter
my shape forever .
I love thee wealthier , thou hast a noble touch ; and by this means ,
which is the only safe means to preserve thy mother from such
an ugly land - and sea-monster as a counterfeit captain is , he
resigning and basely selling all his estate , title , right , and
interest in his lady , as the form of the writing shall testify ,
What otherwise can follow but to have
A lady safe deliver 'd of a knave ?
I am in debt my life to the free goodness of your inventions .
Oh , they must ever strive to be so good !
Who sells his vow is stamped the slave of blood .
Away !
Captain , my husband--
Hence ! We 're at a price for thee , at a price ,
Wants but the telling and the sealing ; then--
Have you no sense , neither of my good name
Or your own credit ?
Credit ? Pox of credit
That makes me owe so much ! It had been
Better for me by a thousand royals
I had lost my credit seven year ago .
' T'as undone me : that 's it that makes me fly :
What need I to sea else , in the springtime ,
When woods have leaves , to look upon bald oak ?
Happier that man , say I , whom no man trusts !
It makes him valiant , dares outface the prisons ,
Upon whose carcass no gown 'd raven jets :
Oh , he that has no credit owes no debts !
' Tis time I were rid on't .
Oh , why do you
So willfully cherish your own poison ,
And breathe against the best of life , chaste credit ?
Well may I call it chaste , for , like a maid ,
Once falsely broke , it ever lives decay 'd .
Oh , Captain , husband , you name that dishonest
By whose good power all that are honest live ;
What madness is it to speak ill of that
Which makes all men speak well ! Take away credit ,
By which men amongst men are well reputed ,
That man may live , but still lives executed .
Oh , then , show pity to that noble title ,
Which else you do usurp . You 're no true captain
To let your enemies lead you ; foul disdain
And everlasting scandal , oh , believe it !
The money you receive for my good name
Will not be half enough to pay your shame .
No ?
I 'll sell thee then to the smock . See , here comes
My honourable chapman .
Oh , my poison !
Him whom mine honour and mine eye abhors .
Lady ! What , so unjovially departed ?
Fine she-policy ! She makes my back her bolster ,
but before my face she not endures him . Tricks !
Captain , how haps it she remov 'd so strangely ?
Oh , for modesty 's cause awhile , my lord ;
She must restrain herself , she 's not yours yet .
Beside , it were not wisdom to appear
Easy before my sight .
Fah ! Wherefore serves modesty but to pleasure a lady now and
then , and help her from suspect ? That 's the best use 'tis put
to .
Well observ 'd of a captain !
No doubt you 'll be soon friends , my lord .
I think no less .
And make what haste I can to my ship , I durst wager you 'll be
under sail before me .
A pleasant voyage , Captain !
Ay , a very pleasant voyage as can be . I see the hour is ripe :
here comes the prison 's bawd , the bond-maker , one that binds heirs
before they are begot .
And here are the crowns , Captain . Go , attend !
Let our bay courser wait .
It shall be obey 'd .
A farmer 's son , is't true ?
He 's crowns to scatter !
I give you your salute , sir .
I take it not unthankfully , sir .
I hear a good report of you , sir : you 've money .
I have so , true .
An excellent virtue .
you me , Captain ? I have a certain generous itch , sir , to lose
a few angels in the way of profit : 'tis but a game at tennis ,
Where , if the ship keep above line , 'tis three to one ;
If not , there 's but three hundred angels gone .
Is your venture three hundred ? You 're very preciously welcome ;
here 's a voyage toward will make us all--
Beggarly fools and swarming knaves !
Captain , what 's he ?
Fear him not , my lord , he 's a gull ,
he ventures with me ; some filthy farmer 's son : the father 's a
Jew and the son a gentleman . Fa !
Yet he should be a Jew , too , for he
is new come from giving over swine .
Why , that in our country makes him
a gentleman .
Go to! Tell your money , Captain .
Read aloft , scrivener . One , two--
" To all good and honest Christian people ,
to whom this present writing shall come : know you for a certain ,
that I , Captain , for and in the consideration the sum of five
hundred crowns , have clearly bargained , sold , given , granted ,
assigned , and set over , and by these presents do clearly bargain ,
sell , give , grant , assign , and set over , all the right , estate ,
title , interest , demand , possession , and term of years to come ,
which I the said Captain have , or ought to have "--
If I were as good as I should be .
" In and to Madonna Castiza , my most virtuous , modest , loving ,
and obedient wife"--
By my troth , my lord , and so she is--three , four , five , six , seven--
The more slave he that says it , and not sees it .
" Together with all and singular those admirable qualities
with which her noble breast is furnished . "
Well said , scrivener , hast put 'em all in ? You shall hear now ,
my lord .
the beauties of her mind , chastity , temperance ,
and above all , patience"--
You have bought a jewel , i'faith , my lord--nine and thirty , forty--
" Excellent in the best of music , in voice delicious , in conference
wise and pleasing , of age contentful , neither too young to be
apish , nor too old to be sottish"--
You have bought as lovely a pennyworth , my lord , as e 'er you bought
in your life .
Why should I buy her else , Captain ?
" And , which is the best of a wife , a most comfortable , sweet
companion"--
I could not afford her so , i'faith , but that I am going to sea ,
and have need of money .
" A most comfortable , sweet companion"--
What , again ? The scrivener reads in passion .
I read as the words move me ; yet if that be a fault , it shall
be seen no more : " which said Madonna Castiza lying , and yet
being in the occupation of the said captain"--
Nineteen . Occupation ? Pox on't , out with "occupation , "
a captain is of no occupation , man .
Nor thou of no religion .
Now I come to the " to have and to hold ,
use and"--
Use ? Put out "use , " too , for shame , till we are all
gone , I prithee .
" And to be acquitted of and from all former bargains , former sales"--
Former sales?--nine and twenty , thirty--by my troth , my lord ,
this is the first time that ever I sold her .
Yet the writing must run so , Captain .
Let it run on , then--nine and forty , fifty--
" Former sales , gifts , grants , surrenders , re-entries"--
For re-entries , I will not swear for her .
" And furthermore , I the said , of and for the consideration
of the sum of five hundred crowns to set me aboard , before these
presents , utterly disclaim forever any title , estate , right , interest ,
demand , or possession , in or to the said Madonna Castiza , my late
virtuous and unfortunate wife"--
Unfortunate indeed ! That was well plac 'd .
" As also neither to touch , attempt , molest , or encumber any
part or parts whatsoever , either to be named or not to be named ,
either hidden or unhidden , either those that boldly look abroad ,
or those that dare not show their faces"--
Faces ? I know what you mean by faces : scrivener , there 's a great
figure in faces .
" In witness whereof , I the said Captain have interchangeably
set to my hand and seal , in presence of all these , the day and
date above written . "
Very good , sir , I 'll be ready for you presently--four hundred
and twenty , one , two , three , four , five--
Of all deeds yet , this strikes the deepest wound
Into my apprehension .
Reverend and honourable matrimony ,
Mother of lawful sweets , unshamed mornings ,
Dangerless pleasures , thou that mak 'st the bed
Both pleasant and legitimately fruitful :
Without thee ,
All the whole world were soiled bastardy .
Thou are the only and the greatest form
That put 'st a difference between our desires
And the disordered appetites of beasts ,
Making their mates those that stand next their lusts .
Then , with what base injury is thy goodness paid !
First , rare to have a bride commence a maid ,
But does beguile joy of the purity ,
And is made strict by power of drugs and art ,
An artificial maid , a doctor 'd virgin ,
And so deceives the glory of his bed ;
A foul contempt against the spotless power
Of sacred wedlock . But if chaste and honest ,
There is another devil haunts marriage ,
None fondly loves but knows it : jealousy ,
That wedlock 's yellow sickness ,
That whispering separation every minute ,
And thus the curse takes his effect or progress .
The most of men in their first sudden furies
Rail at the narrow bounds of marriage ,
And call 't a prison ; then it is most just
That the disease o ' th ' prison , jealousy ,
Should still affect 'em . But oh ! Here I am fix 'd
To make sale of a wife , monstrous and foul ,
An act abhorr 'd in nature , cold in soul .
Who that has man in him could so resign
To make his shame the poesy to the coin ?
Right , i'faith , my lord ; fully five hundred .
I said how you should find it , Captain ; and with this competent
sum you rest amply contented ?
Amply contented .
Here 's the pen , Captain : your name to the sale .
'Sfoot , dost take me to be a penman ? I protest I could ne 'er
write more than A B C , those three letters , in my life .
Why , those will serve , Captain .
I could ne 'er get further .
Would you have got further than A B C ? Ah , Base
Captain : that 's far enough , i'faith .
Take the seal off , Captain .
It goes on hardly and comes off easily .
Ay , just like a coward .
Will you write witness , gentleman ?
He ? He shall ; prithee come and set thy hand for witness , rogue . Thou
shall venture with me ?
Nay , then I ha' reason , Captain , that commands me .
What a fair fist the pretty whoreson writes , as
if he had had manners and bringing up : a farmer 's son ! His father
damns himself to sell musty corn , while he ventures the money ;
'twill prosper well at sea , no doubt . He shall ne 'er see 't again .
So , Captain , you deliver this as your deed ?
As my deed ; what else , sir ?
The ugliest deed that e 'er mine eye did witness .
So , my lord , you have her ; clip her , enjoy her , she 's your own :
and let me be proud to tell you now , my lord , she 's as good a
soul , if a man had a mind to live honest and keep a wench , the
kindest , sweetest , comfortablest rogue--
Hark in thine ear :
The baser slave art thou , and so I 'll tell her ;
I love the pearl thou sold 'st , hate thee , the seller .
Go , to sea , the end of thee is lousy !
This is fine work ! A very brave end , hum--
Well thought upon , this scrivener may furnish
me .
Why should this fellow be a lord by birth ,
Being by blood a knave ? One that would sell
His lordship if he lik 'd her ladyship .
Yes , my lord ?
What 's here , now ?
I have employment for a trusty fellow ,
Bold , sure--
What if he be a knave , my lord ?
There thou com 'st to me ; why he should be so ,
And men of your quill are not unacquainted .
Indeed , all our chief living , my lord , is by fools and knaves ;
we could not keep open shop else : fools that enter into bonds
and knaves that bind 'em .
Why , now we meet .
And , as my memory happily leads me , I know a fellow of a standing
estate , never flowing :
I durst convey treason into his bosom
And keep it safe nine years .
A goodly time .
And , if need were , would press to an attempt ,
And cleave to desperate action .
PRODITOR
That last fits me .
Thou hast the measure right ; look I hear from thee .
With duteous speed .
Expect a large reward .
I will find time of her to find regard .
Oh , my lord ,
I have strange words to tell you !
Stranger yet ?
I 'll choose some other hour to listen to thee ;
I am yet sick of this . Discover quickly .
Why , will you make yourself known ,
my lord ?
Ay :
Who scourgeth sin , let him do 't dreadfully .
Pox of his dissemblance ! I will to sea .
Nay , you shall to sea , thou wouldst poison the
whole land else . Why , how now , Captain ?
In health .
What , drooping ?
Or asham 'd of the sale of thine own wife ?
You might count me an ass , then , i'faith .
If not asham 'd of that , what can you be asham 'd of , then ?
Prithee ha' done ; I am asham 'd of nothing .
I easily believe that .
This lord sticks in my stomach .
How ? Take one of thy feathers down , and fetch , him up .
I 'd make him come .
But what if the duke should hear of this ?
Ay , or your son-in-law Fidelio know of the sale of his mother ?
What and they did , I sell none but mine own . As for the duke ,
he 's abroad by this time , and for Fidelio , he 's in labour .
He in labour ?
What call you travelling ?
That 's true . But let me tell you , Captain , whether the duke hear
on't , or Fidelio know on't , or both , or neither , 'twas a most
filthy , loathsome part--
A base , unnatural deed--
Slave and fool ! Ha , who ? Oh !
Thou hateful villain ! Thou shouldst choose to sink
To keep thy baseness shrouded .
Ugly wretch !
Who hath laid violence upon my husband ,
My dear , sweet Captain ? Help !
Lady , you wrong your value ;
Call you him dear that has sold you so cheap ?
I do beseech your pardon , good my lord .
Rise .
My abuse 'd mother !
My kind son ,
Whose liking I neglected in this match .
Not that alone , but your far happier fortunes .
Is this the scrivener and the farmer 's son ?
Fire on his lordship , he told me they travell 'd .
And see the sum told out to buy that jewel
More precious in a woman than her eye ,
Her honour .
Nay , take it to you , lady , and I judge it
Too slight a recompense for your great wrong ,
But that his riddance helps it .
'Sfoot , he undoes me !
I am a rogue and a beggar ;
The Egyptian plague creeps over me already ,
I begin to be lousy .
Thus happily prevented , you 're set free ,
Or else made over to adultery .
To heaven and to you my modest thanks .
Monster , to sea ! Spit thy abhorr 'd foam
Where it may do least harm ; there 's air and room .
Thou'rt dangerous in a chamber , virulent venom
Unto a lady 's name and her chaste breath .
If past this evening 's verge the dukedom hold thee ,
Thou art reserv 'd for abject punishment .
I do beseech your good lordship , consider
The state of a poor , downcast captain .
Captain ?
Off with that noble title , thou becom 'st
It vilely ; I ne 'er saw the name fit worse :
I 'll sooner allow a pander a captain than thee .
More 's the pity .
Sue to thy lady for pardon .
I give it without suit .
I do beseech your ladyship not so much for pardon as to bestow
a few of those crowns upon a poor , unfeathered rover , that will
as truly pray for you and wish you hang 'd--as
any man breathing .
I give it freely all .
PHOENIX
Nay , by your favour ,
It will contain you , lady ; here , be gone !
Use slaves like slaves : wealth keeps their faults unknown .
Well , I 'm yet glad , I 've liberty and these ;
The land has plagu 'd me , and I 'll plague the seas .
The scene is clear 'd , the bane of brightness fled ;
Who sought the death of honour is struck dead .
Come , modest lady .
My most honest mother !
Thy virtue shall live safe from reach of shames ;
That act ends nobly , preserves ladies ' fames .
Why , this is but the second time of your coming , kinsman ; visit
me oft 'ner . Daughter , I charge you bring this gentleman along
with you : gentleman . I cry ye mercy , sir , I call you gentleman
still , I forget you 're but a knight ; you must pardon me , sir .
For your worship 's kindness ; worship . I cry you mercy , sir , I
call you worshipful still , I forget you 're but a justice .
I am no more , i'faith .
You must pardon me , sir .
' Tis quickly done , sir ; you see I make bold with you , kinsman ,
thrust my daughter and you into one chamber .
Best of all , sir . Kindred , you know , may lie anywhere .
have a care to the fruits of your body . Look
to her , kinsman .
Fear it not , sir .
Nay , father , though I say it , that should not say it , he looks
to me more like a husband than a kinsman .
I hear good commendations of you , sir .
You hear the worst of me , I hope , sir . I salute my leave , sir .
You 're welcome all over your body , sir .
Nay , I can behave myself courtly , though I keep house i' th ' country .
What , does my niece hide herself ? Not present , ha ? Latronello!
Sir .
Call my niece to me .
Yes , sir .
A foolish , coy , bashful thing it is ; she 's afraid to lie with
her own uncle . I 'd do her no harm , i'faith ; I keep myself a widower
o ' purpose , yet the foolish girl will not look into't . She should
have all , i'faith ; she knows I have but a time , cannot hold long .
See where she comes .
Pray , whom am I , Niece ?
I hope you 're yourself ,
Uncle to me and brother to my father .
Oh , am I so ? It does not appear so , for surely you would love
your father 's brother for your father 's sake , your uncle for your
own sake .
I do so .
Nay , you do nothing , Niece .
In that love which becomes you best I love you .
How should I know that love becomes me best ?
Because 'tis chaste and honourable .
Honourable ? It cannot become me , then , Niece ,
For I 'm scarce worshipful . Is this an age
To entertain bare love without the fruits ?
When I receiv 'd thee first , I look 'd
Thou shouldst have been a wife unto my house ,
And sav 'd me from the charge of marriage .
Do you think your father 's five thousand pound would ha' made
me take you else ? No, you should ne 'er ha' been a charge to me .
As far as I can perceive yet by you , I 've as much need to marry
as e 'er I had : would not this be a great grief to your friends ,
think you , if they were alive again ?
' Twould be a grief indeed .
Y'ave confess 'd
All about house that young Fidelio ,
Who in his travels does attend the prince ,
Is your vow 'd love .
Most true , he 's my vow 'd husband .
And what 's a husband , is not a husband a stranger at first ? And
will you lie with a stranger before you lie with your own uncle ?
Take heed what ye do , Niece , I counsel you for the best : strangers
are drunken fellows , I can tell you ; they will come home late
o ' nights , beat their wives , and get nothing but girls ! Look
to't , if you marry , your stubbornness is your dowry . Five thousand
crowns were bequeathed to you , true , if you marry with my consent ;
but if e 'er you go to marrying by my consent , I 'll go to hanging
by yours . Go to , be wise and love your uncle .
I should have cause then to repent indeed .
Do you so far forget the offices
Of blushing modesty ? Uncles are half father ;
Why , they come so near our bloods they 're e 'en part of it .
Why , now you come to me , Niece ; if your uncle be part of your
own flesh and blood , is it not then fit your own flesh and blood
should come nearest to you ? Answer me to that , Niece .
You do allude all to incestuous will ,
Nothing to modest purpose . Turn me forth ;
Be like an uncle of these latter days ,
Perjur 'd enough , enough unnatural ;
Play your executorship in tyranny ,
Restrain my fortunes , keep me poor , I care not .
In this alone most women I 'll excel ,
I 'll rather yield to beggary than to hell .
Very good ! O' my troth , my niece is valiant ; she 's made me richer
by five thousand crowns , the price of her dowry . Are you so honest ?
I do not fear but I shall have the conscience to keep you poor
enough , Niece , or else I am quite altered o ' late .
The news , may it please you , sir ?
Sir , there 's an old fellow , a kind of law-driver , entreats conference
with your worship .
A law-driver ? Prithee , drive him hither .
No, no , I say ; if it be for defect
of apparance , take me out a special
Very good , sir .
writs of custom , only to delay time , your does
you knight 's service , that 's nothing at all ; get your
out as soon as you can for a jury .
I 'll attend your good worship 's coming out .
Do , I prithee , attend me ; I 'll take it kindly ,
What , old Signior Tangle !
I am in debt to your worship 's remembrance .
My old master of fence : come , come , come , I have not exercis 'd
this twelve moons , I have almost forgot all my law-weapons .
They are under fine and recovery ; your worship shall easily recover
them .
I hope so . When , there ?
Sir ?
The rapier and dagger foils , instantly .
And what 's thy suit to me , old Tangle ? I 'll grant it presently .
Nothing but this , sir , to set your worship 's hand to the commendation
of a knave whom nobody speaks well on .
The more shame for 'em ; what was his offence , I pray ?
nothing but robbing a vestry .
What , what ? Alas , poor knave ! Give me the paper . He did but
save the churchwardens a labour ; come , come , he has done a better
deed in't than the parish is aware of , to prevent the knaves ;
he robs but seldom , they once a quarter . Methinks 'twere a part
of good justice to hang 'em at year 's end , when they come out
of their office , to the true terrifying of all collectors and
sidemen .
Your worship would make a fruitful commonwealth 's-man . The constable
lets 'em alone , looks on , and says nothing .
Alas , good man , he lets 'em alone for quietness ' sake , and takes
half a share with 'em : they know well enough , too , he has an impediment
in his tongue ; he 's always drunk when he should speak .
Indeed , your worship speaks true in that , sir : they blind him
with beer and make him so narrow-eyed that he winces naturally
at all their knaveries .
So , so , here 's my hand to his commendations .
you do a charitable deed in't , sir .
Nay , if it be but a vestry matter , visit me at any time , old Signior
Law-thistle !
Oh , well done , here are the foils ; come , come , sir , I 'll try a
law-bout with you .
I am afraid I shall overthrow you , sir , i'faith .
' Tis but for want of use , then , sir .
Indeed , that same odd word "use " makes a man a good
lawyer , and a woman an arrant . Tuh , tuh , tuh , tuh , tuh ! Now am
I for you , sir ; but first , to bring you into form , can your worship
name all your weapons ?
That I can , I hope . Let me see , longsword , what 's longsword ?
I am so dull 'd with doing justice that I have forgot all , i'faith .
Your longsword , that 's a writ of delay .
Mass , that sword 's long enough , indeed ; I ha' known it reach the
length of fifteen terms .
Fifteen terms ? That 's but a short sword .
Methinks 'tis long enough ; proceed , sir .
A writ of delay , longsword , backsword .
Scandals are backswords , indeed .
case of rapiers .
Oh , desperate !
A sword and dagger . A writ of execution , rapier
and dagger .
Thou art come to our present weapon ; but what call you sword and
buckler , then ?
Oh , that 's out of use now ! Sword and buckler was call 'd a good
conscience , but that weapon 's left long ago ; that was too manly
a fight , too sound a weapon for these our days . ' Slid , we are
scarce able to lift up a buckler now , our arms are so bound to
the pox ; one good bang upon a buckler would make most of our gentlemen
fly i' pieces ; 'tis not for these linty times . Our lawyers are
good rapier and dagger men ; they 'll quickly dispatch your money .
Indeed , since sword and buckler time , I have observ 'd there has
been nothing so much fighting ; where be all our gallant swaggerers ?
There are no good frays o ' late .
Oh , sir , the property 's altered ; you shall see less fighting every
day than other , for every one gets him a mistress , and she gives
him wounds enow ; and , you know , the surgeons cannot be here and
there , too : if there were red wounds too , what would become of
the Rheinish wounds ?
Thou sayest true , i'faith ; they would be but ill-favouredly look 'd
to then .
Very well , sir .
I expect you , sir .
I lie in this court for you , sir ; my rapier is my attorney , and
my dagger his clerk .
Your attorney wants a little oil , methinks ; he looks very rustily .
' Tis but his proper colour , sir ; his father was an iremonger .
He will ne 'er look brighter , the rust has so eat into him ; h'as
never any leisure to be made clean .
Not in the vacation ?
Then Jove will not be at leisure to scour him , because he ne 'er
came to him before .
You 're excellent at it , sir ; and now you least think on't , I arrest
you , sir .
Very good , sir .
Nay , very bad , sir , by my faith ; I follow you still , as the officers
will follow you as long as you have a penny .
You speak sentences , sir . By this time have I tried my friends ,
and now I thrust in bail .
This bail will not be taken , sir ; they must be two citizens that
are no cuckolds .
By 'rlady , then I 'm like to lie by it ; I had rather 'twere a hundred
that were .
Take heed I bring you not an sir .
I must ward myself as well as I may , sir .
' Tis court day now ; my attorney gapes
for money .
You shall have no advantage yet ; I put in my answer .
I follow the suit still , sir .
I like not this court , by 'rlady . I take me out a writ of remove ,
a writ of remove , do you see , sir ?
Very well , sir .
And place my cause higher .
There you started me , sir ; yet for all your demurs ,
which are all longswords , that 's delays , all
the comfort is , in nine years a man may overthrow you .
You must thank your good friends then , sir .
Let nine years pass , five hundred crowns cast away o ' both sides ,
and the suit not twenty ; my counsellor 's wife must have another
hood , you know , and my attorney 's wife will have a new forepart . Yet see at length law , I shall have law . Now beware ,
I bring you to a narrow exigent , and by no means can you avoid
the proclamation .
Oh !
Now follows a writ of execution : a gives
you a wound mortal , trips up your heels , and lays you i' th ' Counter .
I cry your worship heartily mercy , sir ; I thought we had been
in law together , by my
troth .
Oh , reach me thy hand ! I ne 'er had such an overthrow in my life .
' Twas 'long of your attorney there ; he might o ' stayed the execution
non molestandum into the court of equity .
Pox on him , he fell out of my hand when I had most need of him .
I was bound to follow the suit , sir .
Thou couldst do no less than overthrow me , I must needs say so .
You had recovered cost else , sir .
And now , by th ' mass , I think I shall hardly recover without cost .
Nay , that 's an execution is very chargeable .
Well , it shall teach me wit as long as I am a justice . I perceive
by this trial , if a man have a sound fall in law , he shall feel
it in his bones all his life after .
Nay , that 's upon record , for I myself was overthrown
in eighty-eight by a tailor , and I have had a stitch in my side
ever since . Oh !
Why , Latronello , Furtivo , Fucato! Where be these lazy knaves
that should truss me , not one stirring yet ?
Follow , follow , follow !
What news , there ?
This way , this way ! Follow , follow !
Hark , you sluggish soporiferous villains ! There 's knaves abroad
when you are a-bed : are ye not asham 'd on't ? A justice 's men should be up first , and give example to all knaves .
Oh , I beseech your good worship !
Your worshipful worship !
Thieves ! My two-hand sword ! I 'm robb 'd i' th ' hall ! Latronello ,
knaves , come down ; my two-hand sword , I say !
I am Latronello , I beseech your worship .
Thou Latronello ? Thou liest ; my men scorn to have beards .
We forget our beards .
Now , I beseech your worship , quickly remember us .
How now ?
Nay , there 's no time to talk of "how now " ; 'tis done .
Follow , follow , follow !
Four mark and a livery is not able to keep life and soul together :
we must fly out once a quarter ; 'tis for your worship 's credit
to have money in our purse . Our fellow Furtivo is taken in the
action .
A pox on him for a lazy knave ! Would he be taken ?
They bring him along to your worship ; you 're the next justice .
Now or never show yourself a good master , an upright magistrate ,
and deliver him out of their hands .
Nay , he shall find me apt enough to do him good , I warrant him .
He comes in a false beard , sir .
'Sfoot , what should he do here else ? There 's no coming to me
in a true one , if he had one . The slave to be taken ! Do I
not keep geldings swift enough ?
The goodliest geldings of any gentleman in the shire .
Which did the whoreson knave ride upon ?
Upon one of your best , sir .
Stand-and-deliver .
Upon Stand-and-deliver ? The very gelding I choose for mine own
riding ; as nimble as Pegasus the flying horse yonder . Go , shift
yourselves into your coats ; bring hither a great chair and a little
table .
With all present speed , sir .
And Latronello--
Ay , sir ?
Sit you down , and very soberly take the examination .
I 'll draw a few horse heads in a paper , make a show : I hope I
shall keep my countenance .
Pox on him again ! Would he be taken ? He frets me . I have been
a youth myself ; I ha' seen the day I could have told money out
of other men 's purses--mass , so I can do now--nor will I keep
that fellow about me that dares not bid a man stand : for as long
as drunkenness is a vice , stand is a virtue . But I would not
have 'em taken . I remember now betimes in a morning , I would
have peep 'd through the green boughs , and have had the party presently ,
and then to ride away finely in fear ; 'twas e 'en venery to me ,
i'faith , the pleasantest course of life ! One would think every
woodcock a constable , and every owl an officer . But those days
are past with me ; and , o ' my troth , I think I am a greater thief
now , and in no danger . I can take my ease , sit in my chair , look
in your faces now , and rob you ; make you bring your money by authority ,
put off your hat , and thank me for robbing of you . Oh , there
is nothing to a thief under covert bar 'n !
Come , officers , bring him away .
Nay , I see thee through thy false beard , thou
mid-wind-chined rascal!--How now , my masters , what 's he , ha ?
Your worship knows I never come but I bring a thief with me .
Thou hast left thy wont else , constable .
Sir , we understand you to be the only uprightness of this place .
But I scarce understand you , sir .
Why , then , you understand not yourself , sir .
Such another word and you shall change places with the thief .
A maintainer of equal causes , I mean .
Now I have you ; proceed , sir .
This gentleman and myself , being led hither by occasion of business ,
have been offered the discourtesy of the country , set upon by
three thieves , and robb 'd .
What are become of the other two ? Latronello and Fucato!
They both made away from us ; the cry pursues 'em but as yet none
but this taken .
Latronello .
Sir ?
Take his examination .
Yes , sir .
Let the knave stand single .
Thank your good worship .
H'as been a suitor at court , sure ; he thanks me for nothing .
He 's a thief now , sure .
That we must know of him ; what are you , sir ?
A piece next to the tail , sir : a serving-man .
By my troth , a pretty phrase and very cleanly handled ! Put it
down , Latronello ; thou mayst make use on't . Is he of honour or
worship whom thou servest ?
Of both , dear sir ; honourable in mind and worshipful in body .
Why , would one wish a man to speak better ?
Oh , sir , they most commonly speak best that do worst .
Say you so , sir ? Then we 'll try him further . Does your right
worshipful master go before you as an example of vice , and so
encourage you to this slinking iniquity ? He is not a lawyer ,
is he ?
H'as the more wrong , sir ; both for his conscience and honesty ,
he deserves to be one .
Pity he 's a thief , i'faith ; I should entertain him else .
Ay , if he were not as he is , he would be better than himself .
No, 'tis well known , sir , I have a master the very picture of
wisdom--
For indeed he speaks not one wise word .
And no man but will admire to hear of his virtues--
Because he ne 'er had any in all his life .
You write all down , Latronello ?
I warrant you , sir .
So sober , so discreet , so judicious--
Hum .
And above all , of most reverend gravity .
I like him for one quality : he speaks well of his master ; he will
fare the better . Now , sir , let me touch you .
Ay , sir .
Why , serving a gentleman of such worship and wisdom , such sobriety
and virtue , such discretion and judgment as your master is , do
you take such a beastly course to stop horses , hinder gentlewomen
from their meetings , and make citizens never ride but o ' Sundays ,
only to avoid morning prayer and you ? Is it because your worshipful
master feeds you with lean spits , pays you with Irish money , or
clothes you in northern dozens ?
Far be it from his mind , or my report . ' Tis well known he kept
worshipful cheer the day of his wife 's burial , pays our four marks
a year as duly by twelve pence a quarter as can be--
His wisdom swallows it .
And for northern dozens , fie , fie , we were ne 'er troubled with
so many .
Receiving then such plenteous blessings from your virtuous and
bountiful master , what cause have you to be thief now ? Answer
me to that gear .
' Tis e 'en as a man gives his mind to't , sir .
How , sir ?
For alas , if the whole world were but of one trade , traffic were
nothing ; if we were all true men , we should be of no trade . What
a pitiful world would here be ! Heaven forbid we should be all
true men : then how should your worship 's next suit be made ? not
a tailor left in the land ; of what stuff would you have it made ?
not a merchant left to deliver it ; would your worship go in that
suit still ? You would ha' more thieves about you than those you
have banish 'd , and be glad to call the great ones home again to
destroy the little .
A notable rogue !
O' my troth , a fine knave , and he 's answered me gloriously . What
wages wilt thou take after thou art hang 'd ?
More than your worship 's able to give ; I would think foul scorn
to be a justice then .
He says true , too , i'faith , for we are all full
of corruption here .--Hark you , my friends .
Sir ?
By my troth , if you were no crueller than I , I could find in my
heart to let him go .
Could you so , sir ? The more pitiful justice you .
Nay , I did but to try you ; if you have no pity , I 'll ha' none .
Away , he 's a thief , to prison with him !
I am content , sir .
Are you content ? Bring him back ; nay , then , you shall not go .
I 'll be as cruel as you can wish . You 're content ? Belike you
have a trick to break prison , or a bribe for the officers .
For us , sir ?
For you , sir ! What color 's silver , I pray ? You ne 'er saw money
in your life . I 'll not trust you with him . Latronello and Fucato ,
lay hold upon him ; to your charge I commit him .
Oh , I beseech you , sir !
Nay , If I must be cruel , I will be cruel .
Good sir , let me rather go to prison .
You desire that ? I 'll trust no prison with you ; I 'll make you
lie in mine own house , or I 'll know why I shall not .
Merciful sir !
Since you have no pity , I will be cruel .
Very good , sir ; you please us well .
You shall appear tomorrow , sirs .
Upon my knees , sir .
You shall be hang 'd out o ' th ' way . Away with him , Latronello
and Fucato! Officers , I discharge you my house ; I like not your
company .
Report me as you see me , fire and fuel ;
If men be Jews , justices must be cruel .
So , sir , extremes set off all actions thus ;
Either too tame or else too tyrannous .
He being bent to fury , I doubt now
We shall not gain access unto your love ,
Or she to us .
Most wishfully , here she comes .
Is that she ?
This is she , my lord .
A modest presence .
Virtue bless you , lady .
You wish me well , sir .
I 'd first encharge this kiss , and next this paper ;
You 'll know the language ; 'tis Fidelio 's .
My ever-vowed love ! How is his health ?
As fair as is his favour with the prince .
I 'm sick with joy : does the prince love him so ?
His life cannot requite it .
I had a token for you , kept it safe ,
Till by misfortune of the way this morning
Thieves set upon this gentleman and myself ,
And with the rest robb 'd that .
Oh , me , I 'm dearly
Sorry for your chance ! Was it your loss ?
They boldly look you in the face that robb 'd you ;
No further villains than my uncle 's men .
What , lady ?
' Tis my grief I speak so true .
Why , my lord !
PHOENIX
But give me pausing , lady ; was he one
That took the examination ?
One , and the chief .
Henceforth hang him that is no way a thief ;
Then I hope few will suffer .
Nay , all the jest was , he committed him
To the charge of his fellows , and the rogue
Made it lamentable , cried to leave 'em .
None live so wise but fools may once deceive 'em !
An uncle so insatiate !
Ay , is't not strange , too ,
That all should be by nature vicious ,
And he bad against nature ?
Then you have heard the sum of all my wrongs ?
Lady , we have , and desire rather now
To heal 'em than to hear 'em .
For by a letter from Fidelio
Direct to us , we are entreated jointly
To hasten your remove from this foul den
Of theft and purpos 'd incest .
I rejoice
In his chaste care of me ; I 'll soon be furnish 'd .
He writes that his return cannot be long .
I 'm chiefly glad . But whither is the place ?
To the safe seat of his late wronged mother .
I desire it .
Her conference will fit mine ; well you prevail .
At next grove we 'll expect you .
I 'll not fail .
It stands upon the frame of my reputation , I protest , lady .
Lady : that word is worth an hundred angels at all times , for it
cost more . If I live till tomorrow night , my sweet Pleasure ,
thou shalt have them .
Could you not make 'em a hundred and fifty , think you ?
I 'll do my best endeavour to multiply , I assure you .
Could you not make 'em two hundred ?
No, by my faith--
Peace , I 'll rather be confin 'd in the hundred and fifty .
Come e 'en much about this time , when taverns give up their ghosts ,
and gentlemen are in their first cast .
I 'll observe the season .
And do but whirl the ring o ' th ' door once about ; my maidservant
shall be taught to understand the language .
Enough , my sweet Revenue .
Good rest , my effectual Pleasure .
Come hither , Phoenix .
What makes your honour break so early ?
A toy , I have a toy .
A toy , my lord ?
Before thou layest thy wrath upon the duke ,
Be advis 'd .
Ay , ay , I warrant you , my lord .
Nay , give my words honour ; hear me .
I 'll strive to bring this act into such form
And credit amongst men , they shall suppose ,
Nay , verily believe , the prince , his son ,
To be the plotter of his father 's murder .
Oh , that were infinitely admirable !
Were 't not ? It pleaseth me beyond my bliss .
Then if his son meet death as he returns ,
Or by my hired instruments turn up ,
The general voice will cry , " Oh , happy vengeance ! "
Oh , blessed vengeance !
Ay , I 'll turn my brain
Into a thousand uses , tire my inventions ,
Make my blood sick with study , and mine eye
More hollow than my heart ; but I will fashion ,
Nay , I will fashion it . Canst counterfeit ?
The prince 's hand ? Most truly , most direct ;
You shall admire it .
Necessary mischief ,
Next to a woman , but more close in secrets !
Thou'rt all the kindred that my breast vouchsafes .
Look into me anon : I must frame , and muse ,
And fashion .
' Twas to look into thee , in whose heart
Treason grows ripe , and therefore fit to fall ;
That slave first sinks whose envy threatens all .
Now is his venom at full height .
FIRST VOICE WITHIN
" Lying or being in the said county , in the tenure and occupation
aforesaid"--
SECOND VOICE WITHIN
No more , then ; a writ of course upon the matter of--
THIRD VOICE WITHIN
Silence !
FOURTH VOICE WITHIN
Oho-o-o-yes ! Carlo Turbulenzo , appear , or lose twenty mark in
the suits .
Ha ? Whither have my thoughts conveyed me ? I am now within the
dizzy murmur of the law .
FIRST VOICE WITHIN
So that then , the cause being found clear , upon the last citation--
FOURTH VOICE WITHIN
Carlo Turbulenzo , come into the court .
Now , now , now , now , now , upon my knees I praise Mercury , the god
of law ! I have two suits at issue , two suits at issue .
Do you hear , sir ?
I will not hear ; I 've other business .
I beseech you , my learned counsel--
Beseech not thee , beseech not me ! I am a mortal man , a client
as you are ; beseech not me !
I would do all by your worship 's direction .
Then hang thyself .
Shall I take out a special
Mad me not , torment me not , tear me not ! You 'll give me leave
to hear mine own cause , mine own cause !
FIRST VOICE WITHIN
Nay , moreover , and further--
Well said , my lawyer , well said , well said !
FIRST VOICE WITHIN
All the opprobrious speeches that man could invent , all malicious
invectives , called wittol to his face--
That 's I , that 's I ; thank you , my learned counsel , for your good
remembrance . I hope I shall overthrow him horse and foot .
Nay , but good sir--
No more , sir ; he that brings me happy news first I 'll relieve
first .
Sound executions rot thy cause and thee !
Ay , ay , pray so still , pray so still ; they 'll thrive the better .
I wonder how this fellow keeps out madness ?
What stuff his brains are made on ?
I suffer , I suffer , till I hear a judgment !
What , old signior ?
Prithee , I will not know thee now ; 'tis a busy time , a busy time
with me .
What , not me , signior ?
TANGLE
Oh , cry thee mercy ! Give me thy hand ; fare thee well . He 's no
relief again me , then ; his demurs will not help him ; his
will but play the knaves with him .
The justice , 'tis he .
Have I found thee , i'faith ? I thought where I should smell thee
out , old Tangle .
What , old signior justicer ? Embrace me another time , an you
can possible . How does all thy wife 's children ? Well ? That 's
well said , i'faith .
Hear me , old Tangle .
Prithee , do not ravish me ; let me go .
I must use some of thy counsel first .
Sirrah , I ha' brought him to an exigent . Hark ! That 's my cause ,
that 's my cause yonder ! I twing 'd him , I twing 'd him !
My niece is stolen away .
Ah , get me a quickly ! Nay , you must not
stay upon't , I 'd fain have you gone .
A I 'll about it presently ; adieu .
You seek to catch her , justice ; she 'll catch you .
A judgment , a judgment !
What , what , what ?
Overthrown , overthrown , overthrown !
Ha ? Ah , ah !
News , news , news !
The devil , the devil , the devil !
Twice Tangle 's overthrown , twice Tangle 's overthrown !
Hold !
Now , old cheater of the law--
Pray give me leave to be mad .
Thou that hast found such sweet pleasure in the vexation of others--
May I not be mad in quiet ?
Very marrow , very manna to thee to be in law--
Very syrup of toads and preserv 'd adders !
Thou that hast vex 'd and beggar 'd the whole parish , and made the
honest churchwardens go to law with the poor 's money--
Hear me , do but hear me ! I pronounce a terrible , horrible curse
upon you all , and wish you to my attorney ! See where a
comes , a and that most dreadful execution ,
There 's no bail to be taken ; I
shall rot in fifteen jails : make dice of my bones , and let my
counsellor 's son play away his father 's money with 'em ; may my
bones revenge my quarrel ! A Here , here ,
here , here ; quickly dip your quills in my blood , off with my skin
and write fourteen lines of a side . There 's an honest , conscionable
fellow ; he takes but ten shillings of a bellows-mender . Here 's
another deals all with charity ; you shall give him nothing , only
his wife an embroidered petticoat , a gold fringe for her tail ,
or a border for her head . Ah , sirrah , you shall catch me no more
in the springe of your knaveries !
Follow , follow him still ; a little thing now sets him forward .
None can except against him ; the man 's mad ,
And privileg 'd by the moon , if he say true :
Less madness 'tis to speak sin than to do .
This wretch , that lov 'd before his food his strife ,
This punishment falls even with his life .
His pleasure was vexation , all his bliss
The torment of another ;
Their hurt his health , their starved hopes his store :
Who so loves the law dies either mad or poor .
A miracle , a miracle !
How now , Fidelio ?
My lord , a miracle !
What is't ?
I have found
One quiet , suffering , and unlawyer 'd man ;
An opposite , a very contrary
To the old turbulent fellow .
Why , he 's mad .
Mad ? Why , he is in his right wits : could he be madder than he
was ? If he be any way altered from what he was , 'tis for the
better , my lord .
Well , but where 's this wonder ?
' Tis coming , my lord : a man so truly a man , so indifferently a
creature ; using the world in his right nature but to tread upon ;
one that would not bruise the cowardliest enemy to man , the worm ,
that dares not show his malice till we are dead . Nay , my lord ,
you will admire his temper ! See where he comes .
I promis 'd your acquaintance , sir : yon is
The gentleman I did commend for temper .
Let me embrace you simply ,
That 's perfectly , and more in heart than hand ;
Let affectation keep at court .
Ay , let it .
' Tis told me you love quiet .
Above wealth .
I above life ; I have been wild and rash ,
Committed many and unnatural crimes ,
Which I have since repented .
' Twas well spent .
I was mad , stark mad , nine years together .
I pray , how ?
Going to law , i'faith , it made me mad .
With the like frenzy , not an hour since ,
An aged man was struck .
Alas , I pity him !
He 's not worth pitying , for 'twas still his gladness
To be at variance .
Yet a man 's worth pity ;
My quiet blood has blest me with this gift :
I have cur 'd some , and if his wits be not
Too deeply cut , I will assay to help 'em .
Sufferance does teach you pity .
Oh , master , master ! Your abominable next neighbour came into the
house , being half in drink , and took away your best carpet .
Has he it ?
Alas , sir !
Let him go ; trouble him not . Lock the door quietly after him ,
and have a safer care who comes in next .
But sir , might I advise you , in such a cause as this a man might
boldly , nay , with conscience , go to law .
Oh , I 'll give him the table too first ! Better endure a fist than
a sharp sword . I had rather they should pull off my clothes than
flay off my skin and hang that on mine enemy 's hedge .
Why , for such good causes was the law ordain 'd .
True , and in itself 'tis glorious and divine ;
Law is the very masterpiece of heaven :
But see yonder ,
There 's many clouds between the sun and us ,
There 's too much cloth before we see the law .
I 'm content with that answer ; be mild still :
' Tis honour to forgive those you could kill .
There do I keep.
Reach me your hand ; I love you ,
And you shall know me better .
' Tis my suit .
The night grows deep , and--
Come away ; this way , this way .
Who be those ? Stand close a little .
Oh , you 're come as well as e 'er you came in your life ; my master 's
new gone to bed . Give me your knightly hand : I must lead you
into the blind parlour ; my mistress will be down to you presently .
I tell you , our safest course will be to arrest him when he comes
out o ' th ' tavern , for then he will be half drunk and will not
stand upon his weapon .
Our safest course indeed , for he will draw .
That he will , though he put it up again , which is more of his
courtesy than of our deserving .
The world is nothing but vexation ,
Spite , and uncharitable action .
Did you see the gentleman ?
Not I.
Where should he be ? It may be he 's passed by ;
Good sir , let 's overtake him .
Here , sir , now you are there , sir ; she 'll come to you instantly .
I must not stay you ; my mistress would be jealous . You must
do nothing to me ; my mistress would find it quickly .
'Sfoot , whither am I led ? Brought in by th ' hand ? I hope it
can be no harm to stay for a woman , though indeed they were never
more dangerous . I have ventured hitherto and safe , and I now
must venture to stay now . This should be a fair room , but I see
it not : the blind parlour calls it she ?
JEWELLER 'S WIFE
Where art thou , Oh , my knight ?
Your knight ? I am the duke 's knight .
I say you 're my knight , for I 'm sure I paid for you .
Paid for you ? Hum ; 'sfoot , a light !
Now out upon the marmoset ! Hast thou serv 'd me so long , and offer
to bring in a candle ?
Fair room , villainous face , and worse woman !
I ha' learnt something by a glimpse o ' th ' candle .
How happen 'd it you came so soon ? I look 'd not for you these
two hours . Yet , as the sweet chance is , you came as well as a
thing could come , for my husband 's newly brought abed .
And what has Jove sent him ?
He ne 'er sent him anything since I knew him : he 's a man of a bad
nature to his wife ; none but his maids can thrive under him .
Out upon him !
Ay , judge whether I have a cause to be a courtesan or no ? to do
as I do ? An elderly fellow as he is , if he were married to a
young virgin , he were able to break her heart , though he could
break nothing else . Here , here , there 's just a hundred and fifty
but I stole 'em so hardly from him , 'twould
e 'en have griev 'd you to have seen it .
So 'twould , i'faith .
Therefore , prithee , my sweet Pleasure , do not keep company so
much . How do you think I am able to maintain you ? Though I be
a jeweller 's wife , jewels are like women , they rise and fall ;
we must be content to lose sometimes to gain often : but you 're
content always to lose and never to gain . What need you ride
with a footman before you ?
Oh , that 's the grace !
The grace ? ' Tis sufficient grace that you 've a horse to ride
upon . You should think thus with yourself every time you go to
bed : if my head were laid , what would become of that horse ? He
would run a bad race then , as well as his master .
Nay , an you give me money to chide me--
No, if it were as much more , I would think it foul scorn to chide
you . I advise you to be thrifty , to take the time now while you
have it ; you shall seldom get such another fool as I am , I warrant
you . Why , there 's Matreza Auriola keeps her love with half the
cost that I am at ; her friend can go afoot like a good husband ,
walk in worsted stockings , and inquire for the sixpenny ordinary .
Pox on't , and would you have me so base ?
No, I would not have you so base , neither : but now and then , when
you keep your chamber , you might let your footman out for eightpence
a-day ; a great relief at year 's end , I can tell you .
The age must needs be foul when vice reforms it .
Nay , I 've a greater quarrel to you yet .
I'faith , what is't ?
You made me believe at first the prince had you in great estimation ,
and would not offer to travel without you , nay , that he could
not travel without your direction and intelligence .
I 'm sorry I said so , i'faith , but sure I was overflown when I
spoke it : I could ne 'er ha' said it else .
Nay , more : you swore to me that you were the first that taught
him to ride a great horse , and tread the ring with agility .
By my troth , I must needs confess I swore a great lie in that ,
and I was a villain to do it , for I could ne 'er ride a great horse
in my life .
Why lo , who would love you now but a citizen 's wife ? So inconstant ,
so forsworn ! You say women are false creatures , but take away
men and they 'd be honester than you . Nay , last of all , which
offends me most of all , you told me you could countenance me at
court , and you know we esteem a friend there more worth than a
husband here .
What I spake of that , lady , I 'll maintain .
You maintain ? You seen at court ?
Why , by this diamond--
Oh , take heed ! you cannot have that ; 'tis always in the eye of
my husband .
I protest I will not keep it , but only use it for this virtue :
as a token to fetch you and approve my power , where you shall
not only be received but made know to the best and chiefest .
Oh , are you true ?
Le me lose my revenue else .
That 's you word indeed , and upon that condition take it , this
kiss , and my love forever .
Enough !
Give me thy hand ; I 'll lead thee forth .
I 'm sick of all professions ; my thoughts burn :
He travels best that knows when to return .
Adieu , farewell , to bed you , I to my sweet city-bird , my precious
Revenue : the very thought of a hundred and fifty angels increases
oil and spirit , ho!
I arrest you , sir .
Oh !
You have made us wait a goodly time for you , have you not , think
you ? You are in your rouses and mulwines ; a pox on you ! And
you have no care of poor officers staying for you .
I drunk but one health , I protest , but I could void it now . At
whose suit , I pray ?
At the suit of him that makes suits , your tailor .
Why , he made me the last ; this , this that I wear .
Argo . Nay , we have been scholars , I can tell you ; we could not
have been knaves so soon else : for as in that notable city call 'd
London stand two most famous universities , Poultry and Woodstreet ,
where some are of twenty years ' standing , and have took all their
degrees from the Master 's side down to the Mistress ' side , the
Hole , so in like manner--
Come , come , come , I had quite forgot the hundred and fifty angels .
' Slid , where be they ?
I 'll bring you to the sight of 'em presently .
A notable lad , and worthy to be arrested ! We 'll have but ten
for waiting , and then thou shalt choose whether thou wilt run
away from us , or we from thee .
A match at running . Come , come , follow me !
Nay , fear not that .
Peace ; you may happen to see toys , but do not see 'em .
Pah !
That 's the door .
FIRST OFFICER
This ?
KNIGHT
'Sfoot , officer , you have spilled all already !
Why ?
Why ? You shall see ; you should have but whirl 'd the ring once
about , and there 's a maidservant brought up to understand it .
Who 's at door ?
All 's well again . Phist , 'tis I , 'tis I.
You ? What are you ?
Puh ! Where 's thy mistress ?
What of her ?
Tell her one , she knows who , her here , say .
Her My mistress scorns to be without her pleasure
at this time of night . Is she so void of friends , think you ?
Take that for thinking so !
The hundred and fifty angels are lock 'd up in a box ; we shall
not see 'em tonight .
How 's this ? Am I used like a hundred pound gentleman ? Damn me
if ever I be her pleasure again ! Well , I must to prison .
Go prepare his room ; there 's no remedy . I 'll bring him along ;
he 's tame enough now .
Dare my tailor presume to use me in this sort ?
He steals , and I must lie in prison for't .
Come , come , away , sir !
Art sure thou sawest him arrested , drawer ?
If mine eyes be sober .
And that 's a question . Mass , here he goes ! He shall not go to
prison ; I have a trick shall bail him . Away !
Oh !
Guess , guess , who am I ? Who am I ?
Who the devil are you ? Let go ! A pox on you ! Who are you ? I
have lost my prisoner .
Prisoner ? I 've mistook ; I cry you heartily mercy . I have done
you infinite injury , o ' my troth ; I took you to be an honest man .
Where were your eyes ? Could you not see I was an officer ? Stop ,
stop , stop , stop !
Ha , ha , ha , ha !
Now , Phoenix .
Now , my lord .
Let princely blood
Nourish our hopes ; we bring confusion now .
A terrible sudden blow .
Ay ; what day
Is this hangs over us ?
By th ' mass , Monday .
As I could wish ; my purpose will thrive best .
' Twas first my birthday , now my fortune 's day .
I see whom fate will raise needs never pray .
Never .
How is the air ?
Oh , full of trouble !
Does not the sky look piteously black ?
As if 'twere hung with rich men 's consciences .
Ah , stuck not a comet like a curbuncle
Upon the dreadful brow of twelve last night ?
Twelve ? No, 'twas about one .
About one ? Most proper ,
For that 's the duke .
Well shifted from thyself .
I could have wished it between one and two ,
His son and him .
I 'll give you comfort , then .
Prithee .
There was a villainous raven seen last night
Over the presence chamber in hard justle
With a young eaglet .
A raven ? That was I ; what did the raven ?
Marry , my lord , the raven . To say truth ,
I left the combat doubtful .
So 'tis still ,
For all is doubt till the deed crown the will .
Now bless thy loins with freedom , wealth , and honour ;
Think all thy seed young lords , and by this act
Make a foot-cloth 'd posterity ; now imagine
Thou see 'st thy daughters with their trains borne up ,
Whom else despised want may curse to whoredom ,
And public shames , which our state never threat :
She 's never lewd that is accounted great .
l 'll alter that court-axiom , thus renew 'd :
She 's never great that is accounted lewd .
Stand close ; the presence fills . Here , here the place ;
And at his rising let his fall be base ,
Beneath thy foot .
How for his guard , my lord ?
My gold and fear keep with the chief of them .
That 's rarely well .
Bold , heedless slave , that dares attempt a deed
Which shall in pieces rend him!--
My lords both !
The happiness of the day !
Time my returning ;
Treasons have still the worst , yet still are spurning .
The duke !
I ne 'er was gladder to behold him .
Long live your grace !
I do not like that strain :
You know my age affords not to live long .
Spoke truer than you think for .
Bestow that wish upon the prince our son .
Nay , he 's not to live long , neither .
Him as the wealthy treasure of our hopes ,
You as possession of our present comfort ,
Both in one heart we reverence in one .
Oh , treason of a good complexion !
How now , what fresher news fills the court 's ear ?
Fidelio!
Glad tidings to your grace !
The prince is safe return 'd , and in your court--
Our joy breaks at our eyes ; the prince is come !
Soul-quicking news ! Pale vengeance to my blood !
By me presenting to your serious view
A brief of all his travels .
' Tis most welcome ;
It shall be dear and precious to our eye .
He reads ; I 'm glad he reads .
Now , take thy opportunity , leave that place .
At his first rising let his fall be base .
That must be altered now .
Which , his rising or his fall ?
Art thou dull now ?
Thou hear 'st the prince is come .
What 's here ?
My lord ?
" I have got such a large portion of knowledge ,
most worthy father , by the benefit of my travel"--
And so he has , no doubt , my lord .
" That I am bold now to warn you of Lord Proditor 's
insolent treason , who has irreligiously seduc 'd a fellow and closely
convey 'd him e 'en in the presence chair to murder you . "
Oh , guilty , guilty !
What was that fell ? What 's he ?
I am the man .
Oh , slave !
I have no power to strike .
I 'm gone , I 'm gone !
Let me admire heaven 's wisdom in my son .
I confess it ; he hir 'd me--
This is a slave :
' Tis forg 'd against mine honour and my life ;
For in what part of reason can 't appear ,
The prince , being travell 'd , should know treasons here ?
Plain counterfeit--
Dost thou make false our son ?
I know the prince will not affirm it .
He can
And will , my lord .
Most just , he may .
A guard .
We cannot but in loyal zeal ourselves
Lay hands on such a villain .
Stay you ; I find you here , too .
Us , my lord ?
" Against Lussurioso and Infesto , who not only
most riotously consume their houses in vicious gaming , mortgaging
their livings to the merchant , whereby he with his heirs enter
upon their lands ; from whence this abuse comes , that in short
time the son of the merchant has more lordships than the son of
the nobleman , which else was never born to inheritance : but that
which is more impious , they most adulterously train out young
ladies to midnight banquets , to the utter defamation of their
own honours and ridiculous abuse of their husbands . "
How could the prince hear that ?
Most true , my lord :
My conscience is a witness 'gainst itself ;
For to that execution of chaste honour
I was both hir 'd and led .
I hope the prince , out of his piteous wisdom ,
Will not give wrong to us ; as for this fellow ,
He 's poor , and cares not to be desperate .
Justice , my lord ! I have my niece stol 'n from me ;
She 's left her dowry with me , but she 's gone ;
I 'd rather have had her love than her money , I.
This , this is one of them . Justice , my lord !
I know him by his face ; this is the thief .
Your grace may now to milder sense perceive
The wrong done to us by this impudent wretch ,
Who has his hand fix 'd at the throat of law ,
And therefore durst be desperate of his life .
Peace ! You 're too foul ; your crime is in excess :
One spot of him makes not your ulcers less .
Oh !
Did your violence force away his niece ?
No, my good lord , I 'll still confess what 's truth :
I did remove her from her many wrongs ,
Which she was pleas 'd to leave , they were so vile .
What are you nam 'd ?
Falso , my lord , Justice Falso ;
I 'm known by that name .
Falso , you came fitly ;
You are the very next that follows here .
I hope so , my lord ; my name is in all the records , I can assure
your good grace .
" Against Justice Falso"--
Ah !
" Who , having had the honest charge of his
niece committed to his trust by the last will and testament of
her deceased father , and with her all the power of his wealth ,
not only against faith and conscience detains her dowry , but against
nature and humanity assays to abuse her body . "
I 'm present to affirm it , my lov 'd lord .
How ? What make I here ?
Either I must agree
To loathed lust or despis 'd beggary .
Are you the plaintiff here ?
Ay , my good lord ,
For fault of a better .
Seldom comes a worse .
" And moreover , not contain 'd in this vice
only , which is odious too much , but against the sacred use of
justice , maintains three thieves to his men"--
Cuds me !
" Who only take purses in their master 's liberty ,
where if any one chance to be taken , he appears before him in
a false beard , and one of his own fellows takes his examination"--
By my troth , as true as can be , but he shall not
know on't .
" And in the end will execute justice so cruelly
upon him , that he will not trust him in a prison , but commit him
to his fellows ' chamber . "
Can a man do nothing i' the country but 'tis told
at court ? There 's some busy informing knave abroad , o ' my life .
That this is true , and these , and more , my lord ,
Be it , under pardon , spoken for mine own ;
He the disease of justice , these of honour
And this of loyalty and reverance :
The unswept venom of the palace .
Slave !
Behold the prince to approve it !
Oh , where ?
Your eyes keep with your actions ; both look wrong .
An infernal to my spirit !
My lord , the prince !
Tread me to dust , thou in whom wonder keeps !
Behold , the serpent on his belly creeps .
Rankle not my foot ; away !
Treason , we laugh at thy vain-labouring stings ;
Above the foot thou hast no power o 'er kings .
I cannot with sufficient joy receive thee ,
And yet my joy 's too much .
My royal father ,
To whose unnatural murder I was hir 'd ,
I thought it a more natural course of travel ,
And answering future expectation ,
To leave far countries and inquire mine own .
To thee let reverence all her powers engage ,
That art in youth a miracle to age .
State is but blindness ; thou hadst piercing art :
We only saw the knee , but thou the heart .
To thee then power and dukedom we resign ;
He 's fit to reign whose knowledge can refine .
Forbid it my obedience !
Our word 's not vain ;
I know thee wise , canst both obey and reign .
The rest of life we dedicate to heaven .
ALL
A happy and safe reign to our new duke !
Without your prayers safer and happier !
Fidelio .
My royal lord .
Here , take this diamond :
You know the virtue on't ; it can fetch vice .
Madam Castiza--
She attends , my lord .
Place a guard near us . Know you yon fellow ,
lady ?
My honour 's evil !
Torment again !
So ugly are thy crimes ,
Thine eye cannot endure 'em .
And that thy face may stand perpetually
Turn 'd so from ours , and thy abhorred self
Neither to threaten wrack of state or credit ,
An everlasting banishment seize on thee !
Oh , fiend !
Thy life is such it is too bad to end .
May thy rule , life , and all that 's in thee glad ,
Have as short time as thy begetting had !
Away ! thy curse is idle .
The rest are under reformation ,
And therefore under pardon .
Our duties shall turn edge upon our crimes .
' Slid , I was afraid of nothing but that for my
thievery and bawdery I should have been turn 'd to an innkeeper .
My daughter ! I am asham 'd her worship should see me .
Who would not love a friend at court ? What fine galleries and
rooms am I brought through ! I had thought my knight have shown
his face here , I.
Now , mother of pride and daughter of lust ,
Which is your friend now ?
Ah , me !
I 'm sure you are not so unprovided to be without a friend here :
you 'll pay enough for him first .
This is the worst room that ever I came in !
I am your servant , mistress ; know you not me ?
Your worship is too great for me to know : I 'm but a small-timbered
woman when I 'm out of my apparel , and dare not venture upon greatness .
Do you deny me then ? Know you this purse ?
That purse ? Oh , death , has the Knight serv 'd me so ?
Given away my favours ?
Stand forth !
Thou one of those for whose close lusts
The plague never leaves the city .
Thou worse than common : private , subtle harlot ,
That dost deceive three with one feigned lip :
Thy husband , the world 's eye , and the law 's whip .
Thy zeal is hot , for 'tis to lust and fraud ,
And dost not dread to make thy book thy bawd .
Thou'rt curse enough to husband 's ill-got gains ,
For whom the court rejects , his gold maintains .
How dear and rare was freedom wont to be !
Now few but are by their wives ' copies free ,
And brought to such a head that now we see
City and suburbs wear one livery .
' Tis 'long of those , an't like your grace , that come in upon us ,
and will never leave marrying of our widows till they make 'em
all as free as their first husbands .
I perceive you can shift a point well .
Let me have pardon , I beseech your grace , and I 'll peach 'em all ,
all the close women that are ; and upon my knowledge there 's above
five thousand within the walls and the liberties .
A band ! They shall be sent against the Turk :
Infidels against infidels .
I will hereafter live so modestly
I will not lie with mine own husband , nor
Come near a man in the way of honesty .
I 'll be her warrant , my lord .
You are deceived ;
You think you 're still a justice .
'Sfoot , worse than I was before I kneel 'd ! I am no justice now ;
I know I shall be some innkeeper at last .
My father , 'tis mine own father !
I should have wonder 'd else , lust being so like .
Her birth was kin to mine ; she may prove modest :
For my sake , I beseech you , pardon her .
For thy sake , I 'll do more : Fidelio , hand her .
My favours on you both ; next , all that wealth
Which was committed to that perjur 'd 's trust .
I 'm a beggar now ; worse than an innkeeper !
Your shall not serve : I 'll set myself free with
What 's he ? A guard !
Under your sufferance ,
Worthy father , his harm is to himself ;
One that has lov 'd vexation so much ,
He cannot now be rid on't :
He 's been so long in suits that he 's law-mad .
it had been my solicitor : oh , the pens prick me !
And here comes he , wonder for temperance ,
Will take the cure upon him .
A blessing to this fair assembly .
Away ! I 'll have none on't ; give me an
or a or a dispatch in twelve terms : there 's
a blessing , there 's a blessing !
You see th ' unbounded rage of his disease .
' Tis the foul fiend , my lord , has got within him .
The rest are fair to this , this breeds in ink ,
And to that colour turns the blood possess 'd :
For instance , now your grace shall see him dress 'd .
Ah hah ! I rejoice then he 's puzzled , and muzzled too :
Is't come to a
Ah , good sir ,
This is for want of patience .
That 's a fool :
She never saw the dogs and the bears fight ;
A country thing !
This is for lack of grace .
I 've other business , not so much idle time .
You never say your prayers .
I 'm advis 'd by my learned counsel .
The power of my charm come o 'er thee ,
Place by degrees thy wits before thee ;
With silken patience here I bind thee ,
Not to move till I unwind thee .
Yea ! Is my cause so muddy ? Do I stick , do I stick fast ?
Advocate , here 's my hand ; pull , art made of flint ?
Wilt not help out ? Alas , there 's nothing in't !
Oh , do you sluice the vein now ?
Yes , my honour 'd lord .
Pray , let me see the issue .
I therefore seek to keep it .
Now burst out ,
Thou filthy stream of trouble , spite , and doubt !
Oh , an extent , a proclamation , a summons , a recognisance , a tachment ,
and injunction ! A writ , a seizure , a writ of 'praisement , an
absolution , a
You 're quieter , I hope , by so much dregs .
Behold , my lord .
This ! Why , it outfrowns ink .
' Tis the disease 's nature , the fiend 's drink .
Oh , sick , sick , Signior Plyfee , sick !
Lend me thy nightcap . Oh !
The balsam of a temperate brain
I pour into this thirsty vein ,
And with this blessed oil of quiet ,
Which is so cheap that few men buy it ,
Thy stormy temples I allay :
Thou shalt give up the devil , and pray ;
Forsake his works , they 're foul and black ,
And keep thee bare in purse and back .
No more shalt thou in paper quarrel ,
To dress up apes in good apparel .
He throws his stock and all his flock
Into a swallowing gulf
That sends his goose unto his fox ,
His lamb unto his wolf .
Keep thy increase ,
And live at peace ,
For war 's not equal to this battle :
That eats but men , this men and cattle ;
Therefore no more this combat choose ,
Where he that wins does always lose ,
And those that gain all , with this curse receive it ,
From fools they get it , to their sons they leave it .
Hail , sacred patience ! I begin to feel
I have a conscience now ; truth in my words ,
Compassion in my heart , and , above all ,
In my blood peace 's music . Use me how you can ,
You shall find me an honest , quiet man .
Oh , pardon , that I dare behold that face !
Now I 've least law I hope I have most grace .
We both admire the workman and his piece .
Thus , when all hearts are tun 'd to honour 's strings ,
There is no music to the quire of kings .
